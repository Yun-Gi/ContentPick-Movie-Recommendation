        "body":"I must admit, I didn't have high expectations for this drama 🤔 and was even tempted to skip it. The genres-Thriller, Mystery, Romance, Drama-didn't grab me initially. 🤷‍♂️ And honestly (I can't believe I'm saying this 😅), I wasn't the biggest fan of either lead before this.BUT WOW... this drama has completely changed my opinion! 😍 Both leads fit their roles perfectly, and their performances have really won me over. 👏👏 The cinematography, music, and OST? Absolutely stunning! 🎶✨Yes, if you really dig, you can find plot issues and faults (as with any drama, tbh). But this isn't one to nitpick over. Dramas are all about escapism, and this one, based on a novel 📖, does a fantastic job pulling you into its world.At just 4 episodes in, I'm already hooked! If they can keep this momentum going, this could easily turn into a standout drama. Fingers crossed! 🤞",

But my gut feeling said that this is gonna be an amazing thriller :)So I kept watching !!!After watching the third episode..... I knew this is gonna be be another my forever favourite drama <3\nBecause it completely changed my viewpoint and now I am eagerly waiting for the 5th episode.I am nervous to know what will happen after the ice cold husband got to knew that it was his beloved wife who called him as the kidnapper and also what will happen after he realize that his mute wife could talk !!!",

However, after sticking with it for four episodes, it's starting to get interesting.It gives off vibes similar to Manhwa or Wattpad stories. So, don't judge it based on the first episode because, like many K-dramas, it starts slow but gets better.It's obviously a mystery romance show talks about an arranged business married couples who hide secrets from each others, have a family issues but slowly they're getting to know each others.I'm looking forward to the 5th episode and hope it continues to improve or at least on this pace and doesn't get worse.",

The sexual tension between them is so much that anyone can see it.The leads fit perfectly in there roles. The dialogues , cinematography, focus on every small details makes it wattpad coded that you can fall for.The drama is interesting it keeps you hooked everything is moving fast unlike kdramas which are slow. The male lead's character really workship the female lead character but acts cold towards her.In the first episode when he said \"my wife is my weakness\" you will get to know it from every scene from the drama. Hope they continue the drama at the same pace.",

Now, I am also openminded enough to accept the fact that some characters in some shows do really stupid things, just because...Now, in the middle of episode 1, a kidnapper with a speech impediment (which does not sound authentic and is just annoying) gets in the car of his victim (the main actress). While she's driving, with him sitting in the back seat, he tries to strangle her... okay... then, he goes on about how he like \"that look\" or something. He then go on this long tirade and tell her, for no apparent reason, about how his phone has VPN installed and that no one can trace his call for 10 min... I don't know if this is some kind of misdirection or even a dream sequence that will be explained later in the show. Whatever the case maybe, if you throw away any semblance of logic in the first episode, it is highly likely that logic will be easily ignored in future episodes. Despite my best effort, I couldn't make it all the way through the first episode...Interesting concept. Very good acting. If you value logic in storytelling, then save yourself the trouble.",

        "body":"I was hooked on the mystery vibes, but then it did turn into a pretty steady love story. It is in fact the story of several loves - In-ji's doomed love for Seo Do Ha, Jeong-won's love for Seo-yoon, Seo-yoon and her husband, Om Tae-seong's obsessive love for In-ji, and Jeong-won's unexpected love for In-ji. And vice-versa, in some of the cases.The main story was a little surprising and a little unconvincing for me in the beginning, I am missing a timeline to understand how long it took Jeong-won to get over his obsession for his ex, which is paralyzing as shown in the first episode. There are quite a few things that don't make sense emotionally here, I am not given enough to believe it, there are connections that are a bit underdeveloped, such as Ji-o's apparent affection for his wife, which clearly doesn't serve him other than materially, and he seems to be a pretty material person, and by his own admission with a pretty mean streak. In-ji's past relationship with Do Ha is not revealed sufficiently for me to understand her heartbreak, or his actions, although I think we get quite a lot in episode 7. Better late than never.I disliked the house, it felt very inhospitable and I don't understand why somebody would make (or keep) that as a home. Maybe getting stuck in your traumatic past. I didn't care for In-ji's style, I actually disliked the actress' face, I think the hairstyle that they chose does not do her any favours, it only makes her look old and gaunt, but maybe that's a matter of preference. I found her more appealing when her hair was more natural. It's an interesting pairing for sure, and not an obvious attraction. But this is a mature story and I liked that about it, despite what I said above. I guess I would have preferred more developed characters, because the mystery as such turned out to be pretty bland. It is slowly revealed piece by piece, but maybe the most shocking thing in this drama for me was Seo-yoon and Jeong-won's unhealthy attachment to her. And how a few weeks (is it weeks?) with a chill woman dismantles that whole relationship. It's a pretty tough sell, but I went with it because it felt satisfying to watch. What I didn't like, again, is the fact that they did employ the exhausting k-drama trope of them having met previously and it was sort of fate, right?Also, how on earth did they find out about Ji-o? I wish they hadn't really. I felt sympathy for that guy, I don't know why.",

The electrifying chemistry between the leads was something I didn't expect. Although they both have quiet personalities, they understood each other remarkably well. Netflix did a fantastic job by releasing all eight episodes at once. The series had a gloomy vibe, but to my surprise, it was very comforting. The screenwriting was top-notch, and I binge-watched the entire series in one go. This is one of those standout series that Netflix releases every year. It felt like a perfect year-end K-drama.

It also centers on themes of past traumas, psychological manipulations and complexities of different relationships. It's a powerful well-acted storyline that unwraps slowly but ever so steadily.Thankfully, It's not a typical \"Kdrama\" series that you can find plenty of on Netflix and other streaming platforms lately but you wouldn't find Gong Yoo on one of those anyways.The acting is quite solid especially from the main characters portraying their past emotional traumas and the slow healing they both go through finding each other again (as this was not their first encounter) and possibly lasting love from something that started as an unwanted, bizarre and disturbing contract marriage. But most marriages are contracts is one of themes the show explores and what binds two people together.I haven't read the novel and I am sure this is not completely true to the book as others before it haven't been but on its own merit, this is a beautifully and well crafted production including the music scores and absolutely worth the watch.",

It does a decent job in portraying dark sides of human and marriage while exposing the characters' vulnerability; none of the characters is 100% 'good', I'd say, they are all jaded and broken in their own ways. With a tinge of exaggeration, the drama realistically shows how complicated and heart wrenching relationships can be. 10\/10 for acting skills and the cinematography; I am not a fan of the intimate scenes though. Hope it gets more recognition; even though it may not be as good as the novel(?) according to some reviews, it's worth the time if you prefer the dark, depressing drama type.",

        "body":"The Trunk, a recent Korean Netflix series, attempts to weave psychological depth and mystery into its narrative, focusing on themes of trauma, relationships, and intrigue. However, while its premise holds promise, the execution leaves much to be desired.Strengths1. Ambitious Premise: The concept of a mysterious marriage agency intertwined with personal secrets sets up a foundation for engaging psychological and emotional exploration.2. Themes of Trauma: The storyline, particularly with Seo-yeon's unresolved grief and Han Jeong-won's struggles, opens avenues for examining human complexity and coping mechanisms.3. Cinematography: The visual style and atmospheric tone of the series complement its mysterious theme, immersing viewers into its world.Weaknesses1. Pacing Issues: The slow narrative progression hinders the momentum, with several episodes feeling drawn out and lacking impactful moments. The genre-blending approach between psychological drama and mystery dilutes the tension, making it difficult for viewers to remain engaged.2. Characterization: Most characters lack charm or emotional depth, failing to create strong connections with the audience. Their motivations and actions often appear underdeveloped, limiting their relatability.3. Underwhelming Script: Despite its psychological underpinnings, the dialogues and plot twists lack the emotional resonance and intellectual insight needed to elevate the series. Key moments fall flat, leaving scenes devoid of intensity.4. Unclear Agency Role: The concept of the secret marriage agency remains poorly explained. Its legality, purpose, and goals are ambiguous, which detracts from the intrigue. The agency feels like a plot device rather than a fully realized entity.5. Missed Opportunities for Emotional Impact: The series introduces heavy themes like personal trauma and relationship complexity but fails to delve deeply enough to leave a lasting impression.Constructive FeedbackTo improve future projects:1. Focus on Pacing and Engagement: Introduce tighter scripting and pacing to maintain intrigue and ensure each scene contributes meaningfully to the plot.2. Develop Relatable Characters: Build multidimensional characters with compelling backstories and motivations to foster stronger emotional connections.3. Clarify Core Elements: Concepts like the marriage agency should be clearly defined, enhancing the believability and immersive quality of the story.4. Invest in Writing: Elevate dialogue and narrative arcs to match the psychological depth the series aims to portray.5. Balance Mystery and Logic: Mystery elements should intrigue rather than confuse. Provide viewers with enough clarity to follow the storyline while keeping the suspense alive.Overall ImpressionWhile The Trunk has an intriguing premise and moments of potential, its execution lacks the charm, intensity, and coherence needed to captivate its audience. With more refined storytelling and stronger character development, it could have been a standout psychological thriller. As it stands, the series struggles to balance its ambitions, leaving many viewers dissatisfied.Rating: 2\/10.",

The majority of K-dramas, lately, have fallen into one of these categories.This time it's door no. 2.I guess THE TRUNK works as a sophisticated, understated thriller, but I couldn't warm to the FL, played by Seo Hyun-Jin. She's an enigma, wrapped in a mystery - a reserved, cryptic presence, who seldom smiles and never laughs. Mistress of the blank stare, she gives herself away by small gestures, or the way her face freezes, mask-like, when she's guarded or frightened. Han Jeong-won, played by Gong Yoo, is like a needy puppy, blurting out his thoughts and emotions from time to time.The details are what makes this series remarkable-the haunting, beauty of Han Jeong-won's opulent, but glacial, residence, the unusual score, and the terse, nuanced dialogues that insinuate more than they elucidate.If you have the patience to unwrap each exquisitely conceived puzzle piece, you'll eventually suss out the situation. But by episode 3, I realized that I just didn't care. Why? Because the premise is so ridiculous. While the characters are well-delineated, the plot is contrived and unconvincing-especially the ending.",

If nudity bothers you then you might not want to watch it, but it was so beautifully written, a wonderful story about two broken people finding each other, in a not so ideal situation.This is a love story.... A story about learning to love yourself, that it's OK to give love in spite your brokenness and it's OK to let people love you in spite of your brokenness. It's about finding that one person, who will accept you and handle your past trauma with care. A person who doesn't shy away from the ugliness that can be life.I applaud the actors for being willing to put them themselves out there, in a drama that doesn't fit the mold of your standard K-drama. It's only eight episodes, but I think that was just enough. Any more, and it would've felt drawn out, any less it would've felt incomplete.I really loved it and I hope others give this drama chance.",

The weaving in of past\/present\/future kept my mind guessing where we were at times which I think contributes to the psychological aspect for the viewer.

        "body":"Absolutely brilliant drama series!So much to unpack but it wasn't that difficult-the many themes. Very slow. Very emotional. Not quite dark mostly grey with a tinge of darkness on the edges.Everyone seems to be carrying baggage. Traumatic bagagge of lost relationships. To the point where the FL no longer believes in the traditional marriage and the female protagonist uses the idea of a paid temp wife to try and teach her husband a lesson on what he is missing. Of course it all backfires.The ML, Goon Yoo is excellent as always, & the FL Seo Hyun-jin, well cast. They turn in tremendous performances emotionally. See some reviewer 'complaints' about the nudity and intimate scenes, well they were barely much of much, but reflect reality, a relief from the usual unreal persistence of prudery in Kdramas. After all intimacy is a significant feature within marriage and that is what the series is about Marriage, but not as you know it!Some think it slow but I found it well paced with beautiful cinematography. The music was pitched at a gentle level and supported the series' themes very well. The properties used and the high-end cars were very OTT, yet the houses used are bland and grey serving to reflect the stark despair and mood of the couples.The occasional negativity was sometimes it took a while to realise that the story had gone back in time to explain something.There is reference to the conflicts of Korean women, marriage, babies, child raising, career or husband. The realisation that you cannot have it all and many women making the choice to stick to careers rather than have families. This Drama series packs a lot tightly into 8 episodes and while there are some unanswered, unfollowed-through bits, however mostly it was a credible drama.The ending is gentle, real and touching. Recommend viewing.Started watching this in English Audio + English subtitles but switched to Korean Audio + English subtitles. Why? Because the vocal pitch in English for the ML was too high. Gong Yoo's actual voice is a lower baritone than the English-speaking dub actor, the latter making for uncomfortable listening.",

I would treat it more like a story about how two people knew each other, understood each other's past, and fell in love. I find this part of the show especially touching for me.

        "body":"I read the short novel a week ago and thought it so amazing, I am going to re-read it (something I rarely do). I was anticipating a faithful adaption to a TV series and wondered how they would accomplish this - because the novel had so many layers and textures to it (which is why I wanted to read it again). Unfortunately, from my perspective, they perverted the essence of the novel and turned it into formulistic 8 part mini-series, fit for mass consumption.What a pity! The novel was entirely from the female lead character's perspective. This is not the case with this adaption. Perhaps it was too hard to make such a nuanced psychological study of the female psyche and the modern institution of marriage - and instead just simply roll out some slick dross that will suck in the majority of viewers.Without the book to refer to, I would probably have watched this series with some degree of interest. However, in comparison, the producers lost an opportunity to make a meaningful commentary about the need for love and what constitutes a fulfilling relationship. In the novel such issues were posed, but there was no satisfactory conclusion. I am not referring to biological reproduction either, but the social structures that we adhere to for whatever reason. The idea of leasing a wife or husband on a one-year term is at the centre of the novel, approached from the perspective of the female lead character.",

I moved away to Asian entertainment because they focused on story and less boobs and sex. The scenes they have had in the first 3 episodes make me not want to finish the series. It's distracting and unnecessary. It's slow and annoying but I do love the ML in his past works and want to give it to the end. FL is killing it in a good way. The second leads are killing it in a bad way, the actual interesting part of this show is lost and it's only 8 episodes.Note for Netflix, focus on the story and omit the boobs.

While Some Korean dramas have become somewhat predictable, often ending in forced emotional climaxes that evoke tears, I still found this show quite entertaining. It offers numerous lessons, delving into human psychology and nature, as well as philosophical ideas like democracy, communism, socialism, dictatorship, and utilitarianism. The watchers monitoring through CCTV cameras in the drama could represent the elite globalists at the top of the capitalist pyramid, or they could symbolize us. After all, most of us likely enjoyed the show as mere spectators rather than feeling disturbed by it. Still, I always like and want to support this style of drama. That's why I believe it deserves at least an 8 out of 10. This drama had too many of his monologues and it was a bit annoying, so I deducted 1 star.P. S. While watching Squid Game, I couldn't help but notice the irony that the creators and investors of \"The 8 Show,\" including Netflix, are likely not members of the ordinary working class. Yet, they seem to be fans of George Orwell's Animal Farm. They seem to know us very well, understanding that instead of resisting upon learning the truth, we tend to accept reality and even strive to climb higher within the system's pyramid.",

Obviously the budget wasn't huge, with nearly all of the season taking place in a single building, and with a cast of 8 characters.

The first episode reels you into the realities of life with a compelling narrative that hooks you instantly. It sets a high bar, making you eager for more. The second episode builds on this by exploring a fantasy of immense wealth, sparking dreams of how such riches could solve one's problems. The third episode introduces the intricacies and wit of the characters, adding depth and complexity that keeps you engaged.However, by the fourth episode, the show begins to falter. The characters start making irrational decisions that undermine the story's credibility. This shift is jarring, considering the initial promise of a smart, well-crafted narrative. Despite my growing frustration, I gave the fifth episode a chance, hoping it would redeem the show. Unfortunately, it didn't. The plot continued to unravel, and the characters' actions remained inconsistent and poorly justified.I had high hopes for \"The 8 Show\" because the beginning hinted at a series with substantial wit and logical sense. The early episodes suggested a thought-provoking storyline with clever characters, but these elements quickly dissolved as the show progressed. The initial intrigue and promise faded, leaving behind a series that struggled to maintain its early momentum and coherence.Ultimately, I decided it was not worth continuing. The potential for a great show was there, but it was squandered by a lack of consistent character development and logical storytelling. I wish the series had stayed true to the sharp wit and logical foundation it initially presented. While \"The 8 Show\" starts strong, it unfortunately loses its way, making it a frustrating watch for those looking for a series that maintains its quality throughout.",

I like series and movies with an social experimental kind of undertone so I got really excited by the build up.But I must say the last three episodes disappointed me.The pacing which started of very well became changed and it seemed like the last episodes where forced and rushed at the same time.Which made them lose the essence of the plot.While at the start I was going to rate this an 8 in the end it dropped to a six because I didn't fully care anymore how it would be ending.When you love Squid game and things like the liar game this can be for you (even though the liar game doesn't get as extreme as this one gets).",

Well executed well made without going overboard, it's kept simple by design. The story and concept are great, characters well thought out and interesting. There's a few low scores for this but they are most likely comparing it to other similar shows. It's not high budget which makes it better. It would be a 10 but it needed a few more episodes ( as opposed to a potential second series) and was a bit of an anticlimax. Binged it all wanting more.

        "body":"Not sure what the other reviews saying it's not similar to Squid Game are referring to. It's definitely not similar in quality , but its message and theme are identical. The game makers have essentially preyed upon people in difficult life circumstances to play a game for their amusement. Just like Squid Game it was inevitable that would involve strategic deception between the characters and violence.Many of the ideas used with the games within the show are interesting , but ultimately end up feeling underwhelming. Further, while you do end up feeling some connection to the characters by the end of the series it pales in comparison to those in Squid Game.If another season was made I'd probably still watch it, but also won't be spending any time hoping for a season 2.",

Actually, there were a lot of shocking scenes, but those were the result of human cruelty rather than scenes specifically designed to result in a bloodbath.That said, the drama has some merits, yes, but fails to have a smooth development, even giving a proper conclusion and explanation to the whole ordeal. Also, the impressive cinematography got tiring after a while.Still, the performances were all great by everyone in the cast.So, overall, six out of ten.",

That being said, it IS inventive in different ways, and keeps the viewer engaged.I could predict about 60% of the plot, which is much less than most, so kudos for that. Korean films and shows can really throw some curve balls with their depravity and plot twists. Might be a slightly different mentality from western culture, I'm not sure what it is, but it works. Train to Busan, I Saw the Devil, Oldboy, there's several gems in Korean cinematography.

It has a point to make and it makes it efficiently in 8 episodes and with 8 characters across 8 floors.The characters are a bit stereotypical-by design, I guess, not because of the lack of thinking-and sometimes they behave in stupid, unexplainable ways.

        "body":"I thoroughly enjoyed this show! At first glance, the premise seemed similar to Squid Game (which I enjoyed too - but not as much), but after the first episode I had forgotten about that. This show was weirdly funny, but that somehow that did not take away from the delivery of the more gloomy subject matter in my opinion. It was also very aesthetically pleasing with lots of beautiful shots and pretty decor.I do agree with some other reviews that the characters are very tropey, but I think that actually was a good choice considering that funny\/gloomy balance. I thought they were easily recognizable personalities so that the focus could be more on their dynamic and common troubles.Overall I found the 8 Show to be creative and a bit odd, which made for a very captivating and memorable watch.",

        "body":"A dark comedy or satire with the unique themes present in this show needs to have at least semi-relatable characters that have basic common sense. They don't have to be the most rational or logical individuals, but the audience should at least feel some sort of emotional connection with them in order to suspend their disbelief.The 8 Show faces a significant challenge here, and unfortunately I think the approach they went with is far too comical, and falls significantly short of quality dark comedy as a result. The contestants are exaggerated caricatures as opposed to relatable humans, and the plot depends far too much on ridiculous decisions and unbelievable traits to progress through a runtime that is about 2 hours too long.I really wanted to like it as I'm a huge fan of satire, especially of the dark variety. I haven't read the source material so I have no comment on that, but the character interactions and decisions play out very much like they are based in a fantasy world from a comic. Appreciate the effort, but this is one that I wouldn't watch again.",

Don't let the opening mall raid put you off. Quickly becomes obvious what that's all about. The lead's face is wonderfully expressive for comedy. Such a handsome \"ham\" is he. Very nice cinematography. Interesting collection of supporting and side characters. Social class issues definitely in play. If the DARK side is what you're after, this doesn't appear to be it. But if a mix of fun, some thrills, nice visuals and solid acting for entertainment without smacking the grey matter hard is what you're after then this might be the ticket.",

        "body":"Flex X Cop starts seemingly outlandish and sets the stage for a largely fun procedural. After a run-in with the law enforcement authorities, Spoilt and rich heir Jin I Soo (Ahn Bo Hyun) finds himself having to join the violent crimes unit at Gangha station as a detective. The stakes are high. His father, whom he has a troubled relationship with, is amping up his campaign to become the city's mayor, and there is immense public scrutiny. The team he joins is led by the no-nonsense Lee Gang Hyun (Park Ji Hyun), a prickly and smart detective. There is also the young, starry-eyed Choi Kyung Jin (Kim Shin Bi), who is in awe of I Soo's lavish life and social media persona, and in contrast, Park Jun Young (Kang Sang Jun), who remains largely unimpressed by I Soo's swagger.The team is suitably annoyed with I Soo's entry, and his privilege, and resents having to babysit him through work. He, on the other hand, having always been a fan of chasing thrills, is intrigued about his new job and is thrilled at having been given a chance to delve into some real-time police work. I Soo, being a silver spoon, is both a boon and a bane for the team- as easy as it is for him to get an audience with the elite during an investigation or channel his many social media followers to aid in a manhunt, he is equally reckless and hasty. In one of the best laugh-out-loud moments from the show, I Soo does not hesitate to clumsily leap out of a window from a multi-storeyed building while in hot pursuit of a suspect as a horrified Gang Hyun watches on. The first few episodes largely focus on I-Soo trying his best to fit in, how he can use his chaebol status to aid with investigation work, and how he plays a role in lending some perspective to cases involving the elite.Flex X Cop isn't, however, all fun and games, and I Soo, thankfully, is not reduced to a caricature. The writer spends considerable time on his troubled relationship with his family as an illegitimate heir to the Hansu Group and the trauma of losing his mother as a child. He might be at loggerheads with his father, Jin Myeong Chul (Jang Hyung Sung), and has to face a barrage of verbal abuse from his step-mother, but we also see how he dotes on his step-brother Jin Seung Ju (Kwak Si Yang) and vice-versa. This is perhaps the show's biggest victory; the fact that the writing humanizes I Soo and spends considerable time on his life outside of the station. This is best summed up by Gang Hyun, who tells him that while he may be rich, and condescending, he also does not hesitate to organize a funeral for a victim who has no family or ensure a wronged artist gets her moment in the spotlight.While the four-detective team from the violent crimes unit takes up various cases, the K-Drama does away with the traditional one-case-per-episode format and adopts a more flexible writing style where nearly two episodes are dedicated to each case. Two main storylines run parallelly - one that focuses on the death of I Soo's mother and the wrongful service termination of Gang Hyun's father, Lee Hyung Jun (Kwon Hae Hyo), the former head of the criminal division.These two plot points take center stage in the show's last six episodes, and there is a sharp shift in the overall tone. This, however, does not feel forced. Flex X Cop has to be one of the rare shows in recent times that does not have pacing issues in its latter half since there is more than enough happening. Despite the second season being announced, the writing here thankfully feels focused and complete and not just solely focused on a build-up for a new season.Gangha station's team of detectives - I Soo, Gang Hyun, Jun Young, and Kyung Jin are immensely likable. It has been so great watching Ahn Bo Hyun's elevation to leading man status. Long a dependable and many times, standout supporting actor, he has proven his worth with some excellent performances in lead roles. And as I Soo, this might be Bo Hyun's most effortless outing yet. He nails the smug, confident I Soo and equally shines in the more sobering parts when tragedy befalls. When the show's tone shifts, he adapts quickly and is vulnerable and believable. Park Ji Hyun could follow a similar path as him. She has had a wide array of roles in different genres in supporting roles. But This time she finally proves that she deserves bigger and better roles. She uses all that experience to play Gang Hyun with a measured, nuanced air, especially given that there are more than a few subtle nods as to how her time in the Gangha station has been as a lone female detective sees her warming up to I Soo and her eccentricities and how the team gradually grows to trust and have each other's backs.Though they tease the prospect of a romance, this season of Flex X Cop thankfully does away with delving deeper there. It would have felt wrong, given what was happening in the final few episodes. The slow progression of I Soo and Gang Hyun's relationship from colleagues to grudging friends, and to being a source of support for each other feels earned. Ji Hyun matches Bo Hyun's energy in her way and the two share great chemistry- especially as an investigating team.Compared to a long list of excellent Korean crime thrillers or procedurals, which include Signal, The Voice, Taxi Driver, and Beyond Evil, Flex X Cop takes a more comedic, light-hearted route, especially in its initial episodes. Despite how the show progressively becomes serious, given the personal tragedies of its protagonists it seeks to delve into, it remains engaging and cohesive throughout. If the prospect of a second season means more adventures from the team of four from Gangha station, we are all buckled up and ready.",

        "body":"Based on a format created by Sreda production\ncompany and a remake of the Russian television-series, 'Silver Spoon.' Flex x Cop is a South Korean adaption which follows an immature third-generation chaebol named Jin Isoo (Ahn Bo-hyun) who spends his evenings having fun and living without a cause. When he is falsely convicted for a felony that he did not commit by the team leader of the violent crime division, Lee Gang-hyun (Park Ji-hyun). The police department works to make amends by stationing him as a police detective. Jin Isoo is berated by his colleagues for having a privileged background yet he ultimately proves his competency once he utilizes his intellect and his resources towards solving investigations.Ahn Bo-hyun was the perfect choice to anchor this series as the leading man. His portrayal as Jin Isoo carries this season with much needed charisma since the narrative structure is quite clichéd and predictable in certain areas. Although, the comedic delivery is well executed as there are numerous laugh-out-loud moments that keep the viewer entertained and the minimal action sequences are sharply choreographed infused with sleek editing. The character-development is lacking which is why I didn't feel as attached to the characters as I should have in the beginning. But all of the performances from the supporting cast members manage to uplift the roles that they are given and make them their own. Particularly Kwak Siyang as Jin Seung-ju, who is a shoulder to lean on as the older sibling of the family. Sharing solid on-screen chemistry with Ahn Bo-hyun.The \"whodunit\" cases keep the viewer engaged on who the culprit may be throughout the entirety of the season and this provides the audience with much to look forward to in the second season since director Kim Jae-hong and writer Kim Ba-da will be returning.IG: thecinephilereviews.",

Su ditches the board meeting in the morning, telling his butler he needs to sleep more. He forces that butler to watch a clip of him swimming with the sharks. He looks like another worthless rich guy, a spoiled brat without a care in the world. Before he goes back to sleep, however, he gets a notification. There's been a kidnapping!

Is he a rich do-gooder, who appears aimless, but actually fights crime on the sly with the vast resources available at his fingertips? Nah, this is\nthe dress-up\/role-play swat team.

In the vicinity, our ML, Jin I \"Su\", has to defend himself against an assailant, but all Hy the cop sees, when she catches up to the action, is Su assaulting someone. He's arrested - Our leads meet that way. Su's chair-dad finds out about the arrest from a reporter. ~ At his press conference ~ He was attempting to announce his candidacy for Mayor of Seoul when he's blindsided by the news. He angrily vows to disown Su... Until the police realize during the course of their investigation that Su actually captured a murderer. He did not commit assault: It was self-defense. Su's father, the chairman, is furious once again, and the police are squirming because they're in a lot of trouble. They work out a win-all-around solution: the police will say that Su's been a cop for 2 months and worked with them to capture this murderer. Now, e'erbody happy. Everybody except Su's \"co-workers\" and the reporter that is now accused of making a false report, as he released the story that Sue had been arrested. So now....Su's on the force. The cops are forced to work with him. But they're hoping he never actually shows up to work.FXC is a 2024 release that is rated 90 on AWiki. It is 1 season consisting of 16 70-minute episodes. It's plenty typical and formulaic, but if you go for cop shows that incorporate humor with a couple surprises, you'll likely enjoy this. I certainly did. The episode about hypnosis is a little bit weak, but all-in-all, one can't ask for more from a cop-edy drama. It's really good - They could turn this into a franchise. The cases are interesting and well conceived. Apparently, S2 has already been announced.Ahn Bo Hyun (Kairos, See You in My 19th Life) plays the rich & spoiled Su. He's been shows that I loved: Her Private Life-8, My Only Love Song-8.7, & Descendants of the Sun-8.3. He was in a show that I liked: My Runway-7.5, and one that I hated: My Name-5.7. He's completely different in everything, so he's as versatile as he is good looking - and he is a specimen. Su inhabits a world that is entirely unfamiliar to the police. He has an advantage when it comes to investigating people of wealth and status as the son of the chairman - the \/illegitimate\/ son. Therefore, his stepmother despises him. Su might seem obnoxious at first, but he's a kind-hearted and delightful person. He's a touch carefree, even careless, but he doesn't have a mean bone in his body. His mother died when he was about 7. He has no memory of it, but he's told it was a car accident. His father is concerned that \"he'll get his memories back\".Park Ji Hyun (Love All Play, Reborn Rich) is Lee Gang Hyeon\/\"Hy\". She's not the most feminine female. Dad, also a decorated detective, is her drinking buddy. She's positively rough... and RUDE, and she despises Su. Her everyday look is so utilitarian that it was jolting to see her dressed up for a sting operation. She looks great. As mature as she seems, she's actually 6 years younger than her co-star. Ahn Bo Hyun must have some amazing genetics, because he looks like he could play a high school kid, still.Kang Sang Jun (Marry My Husband, Doctor Slump) is hardboiled detective Park Jun Yeong, who has been alongside Hy since the academy. He seems overly interested in, and overprotective of her. He doesn't try to hide his disdain for Su. Kim Shin Bi (Journey to the Shore, Revenant) is the friendly junior detective and social media follower of Su, Choi Gyeong Jin. Jung Ga Hee (Longing for You,The Glory) plays medical examiner Yun Ji Won. I love this ME. She's got a dry wit, a great attitude, and she's funny. Jokes coming out of the autopsy room sort of write themselves. In one scene she puts a decayed rice cake that supposedly choked someone to death on the metal tray. She then takes a fresh one, bites it, and puts it on the tray next to the one she extracted from the deceased's throat, showing how the one from the dead body was obviously cut, not bitten. Point made, she picks up the one she had started eating off of the tray and pops it in her mouth. The delivery was perfect. I laughed out loud. Ms Jung has a short resume, and I look forward to seeing her more. Her credits are sure to accumulate as she is absolutely darling.Director: Kim Jae Hong - He's a rock star. His most recent 4 efforts: FXC, Revenant, Through the Darkness, & Begins Youth are all rated 8.7 on MDL. He has 7 other credits; 3 in the 7.5-7.8 range and 4 in the 6.6-7.3 bracket. Not a dud in a bunch. Screenwriter: Kim Ba Da of A Man Who Was Superman & the popular My Name-5.7, which I didn't care for at all.The cops do everything they can to keep Su on the sidelines, but he's just not the kind of guy to sit quietly in the corner. The next couple episodes deal with him proving himself. They're going to have to work with him, they realize. Money makes the day-to-day stuff easier (being a cop sure is costing Su a fortune), but it can really mess up relationships. That's the theme. Speaking of wealth, Su questions a wealthy person of interest at a tanning salon. Given that Kdramas are so pasty skinned my jaw dropped and I haven't found it yet. This is the first tanning bed I've seen in a Kdrama.His stepmother is so abhorrent that he ends up moving back to the house where he lived with his mom, only to find out that Hy now lives across the street. This creates situations where he must interact with her parents. \"For your information, this will be salty. I recommend not eating it.\" So Hy advises when she delivers the kimchi that her mother forced her to bring over. (It took 3 days of nagging but she finally caved in). And that's why Hy crossed the road ~ maybe the chicken was following her.Will the seeds of romance bloom in S2? They aren't there yet, and they have more than one road to cross.She's drab. Oh, how his presence must hurt her eyes! Lime. Plum. Lemon. Tangerine. Grape. His clothes are colorful, bright, expensive, and capital-F-Flashy. He's a peacock. Her car is really messy. She's more dude than chick. He comments on a sticky brown residue in the cup holder. \"Oh, I spilled coffee yesterday.\" Unsatisfied, he presses further: \"Didn't you clean it up?\" Her unfazed answer: \"I did\" Unconvinced, he responds: \"Do you have a tissue or anything?\" She looks around, \"Use this.\" She hands him a piece of \/junk mail\/. Only someone who's lived like a slob or has been around a slob would be able to write that. That's too authentic. It cracked me up.Her Oma falls in love with Su first. Perhaps that's because she sees a potential mate for her rapidly aging daughter. There's nice juxtaposition when he's at his family's home for a press interview. Afterwards, dinner is being laid out, but stepwitch informs him that they are \/not\/ setting a place for him. When he gets home, Hy's mother insists that he come over and have dinner with them.They have to do a stake-out which means spending even more time with eachother. That's followed up by an undercover operation where they are forced closer together. Su has things to work through before he can give all to a relationship. As we get to know Su, it becomes obvious that his cavalier attitude is the way he deals with pain. He's got some trauma that he's never dealt with. He's locked it away under the surface as evinced by his reoccurring dream about a painting of a woman submerged in water. Hy starts to hear from people (her father and a psychiatrist, for example) to be wary of Su: He's a ticking time bomb, she's warned. Halfway through the show, he gets his memory back.Be that as it may, Hy will be the last one to deal with her own feelings. Most of S1 sees her on the fence as to whether she can tolerate Su at all. She wrote up a brutal recommendation to release him from the force, and it sits in her desk drawer. This mindset leads to amusing scenes, for example, when they're about to do a group arrest. She's handing out guns to everyone on the team. Su puts out his hand. Hy gives him handcuffs. There's NO WAY she's giving him a gun. Naturally, \/he's\/ the one that ends up saving the day and slapping the handcuffs on the perp. Later on, we see that he's had them gold-plated! You can't beat a guy with optimism (and resources) like that. You might as well tune in, then: You know if you can't beat 'em, you might as well join 'em!QUOTE📢There's no one who is strong enough to beat everything.〰🖍 IMHO📣8.5 📝8.3 🎭8 💓5 🦋4 🎨7 🎵\/🔊7.4 🔚8.5 ▪ 🌞5.5 ⚡6.5 😅4.5 😭3 😱3 😯3 🤢3 🤔3.5 💤0Re-📺?

        "body":"I found episode 1 somewhere and gave it a try that got me hooked to subscribe to continue watching. Ahn Bohyun's acting of a spoiled and bored chaebol looking for something fulfilling was incredibly convincing from the start. He incorporated arrogance and charm in a way it was impossible not to like him. The encounter with eye rolling detective Lee Ganghyun (Park Jihyun) not at all pleased to have him in her team gives way to a lot heartfelt laughter. While in each episode they have to solve a crime case there is the underground mistery of the caebol's childhood that slowly gets uncovered adding more seriousness to the series. I also really liked the progression of aversion to acceptance to comradeship and friendship of the team while Jin Isoo grew into his detective role. Everybody in their respective roles were very convincing, from small facial expressions to dialogues. The super selfconfident cheabol used to get everything by monetary means uses them to help solve cases and gets scolded. He changes his approach when learning that his behaviour could damage Lee Ganghyun. Still very confident he asks for and gets advice form his younger colleague and fan Choi Kyungjin. Ahn Bohyun convincingly transforms from easygoing to considerate to serious. An excellent choice to have him as ML.The cases in each episode and the underlying theme keep the interest up and the series entertaining. The story arch is well made and cinematography is beautiful. There are hints of romance but the series concentrates on police work while keeping it on the lighter side. The writers did extremely well in developing and uncovering personal traits of the characters and conveying good humour.If you're looking for darker thrills this might not be for you. But if you want good entertainment with some thrills, good laughters without silliness, go for it. This is a really well made piece of drama, entertaining without the usual stereotypes, without loosing drive in the second half and with a satisfying ending. Therefore 10\/10 for this comedy-thriller-mistery that will have a season 2, yippee ;)",

At all. A series of events leads this rich young man to a rare opportunity as a working detective.A police badge opens many doors. Money opens even more. I'm sure you can imagine that the combination is both blessing and at times a curse (lack of respect from colleagues).Each episode has a case to be solved, but there is a thread of background story that also eventually is also resolved. So now we have lots of emotional yet satisfying resolution, but we also have beloved characters and their methods of working together as a foundation for season 2 - which is already confirmed, and which I'm absolutely looking forward to.",

I see no chemistry with her and the male leads ( it all seems quite forced).The second female lead is so sassy and cool ( i actually liked her a lot ). Most of the fans wish her to be with Tae Ho ( but it's one sided love).The storyline is complicated ( revenge --- after 5 years --- after 5 years ), so it's not fun.

The second male lead I get his motivations. As for the female lead, no chemistry with either of the male characters and is not interesting at all. The second female lead is far more watchable and a much better actress, but doesn't get nearly enough screen time.Overall, very disappointing.**Update**: ok, so since I originally posted this review, this show has gone up an entire different level, several levels in fact!

The one should also think about the needs of family so in that way nothing will go wrong. The emotional bond of family will help to overcome the problems.

This show is a masterpiece at showing us that even the tiniest spark can create a turmoil in the eyes of those filled with envy. We should all shine as bright as we can for ourselves and never pour all of ourselves -forgeting who we are on- giving too much credit to those we think worthy of our love or may feel superior. Because at the end of the day, those with the skills, the IQ and street smarts and will to overcome obstacles can achieve the imposible and more times than can be counted, those who are only given things others work hard to achieve, are jealous of your achievement, your will and power to triumph and most of all your impecable character and poise.",

        "body":"Impossible Heir, touted as a captivating drama, disappoints with its disjointed narrative and shallow character development. The series squanders potential with Kang Inha's inexplicable 360-degree turnaround, which feels abrupt and poorly integrated into the storyline. Instead of adding depth, his sudden shift in demeanor comes across as a careless decision by the writers, leaving viewers puzzled and disconnected from his character journey.Similarly, So Han Taeho's betrayal of Inha lacks adequate justification, especially given his shameless behavior towards his best friend's girlfriend. This inconsistency in character motivations detracts from the overall credibility of the plot, leaving viewers questioning the integrity of the storytelling. Additionally, Kang Seoung Ju's unexpected decision to abandon everything at the last minute feels rushed and devoid of meaningful context, further highlighting the series' struggle with coherence and depth.Furthermore, the romantic dynamic between Han Taeho and Heeju feels forced and underdeveloped. Despite attempts to establish chemistry between the characters, their relationship lacks authenticity and emotional resonance. The absence of Heeju during pivotal moments, such as Taeho's imprisonment and his mother's funeral, exacerbates the disconnect between the characters, making their sudden change of heart seem implausible and out of place.I don't even want to talk about the main female lead so overall, Impossible Heir fails to deliver on its promise of intrigue and suspense, succumbing to poor character development and narrative inconsistencies. Despite its potential, the series ultimately falls short, leaving viewers disappointed and longing for a more compelling viewing experience.",

The deductions in the film and the motivation behind the criminals are often nonsensical. The murderer can only be found through sheer guesswork. The themes explored in the drama are either meaningless and used solely for shock-value or banal. And, much of the conflicts early on in the drama is completely forgotten or scrapped by the end. I.e., even this seemingly short 6 episode drama is flooded with useless fillers.It's quite unfortunate because everything else beside this amateurish screenplay was surprisingly good: The actors were great, the music score was on point, and the cinematography was good.

Just like the fans are somehow unable to accept the movie, Peninsular as a standalone movie that was never meant to be a sequel of Train to Busan, they seem to be unable to accept other styles or genres of the shows that Mr. Yeon created. The different show has different story telling. Train to Busan, Hellbound, and Jung E are all different shows, and arguably they all succeeded in their own good storytelling. This show, The Bequeathed also has its own style of story telling, and I haven't found something that lacks so much to be a bad show. It's definitely better than another netflix show, Fool Me Once with a cheesy ending that I've seen multiple times from other movies and tv shows. That was the part I was also worried while I was watching this show, but luckily and surprisingly there was an unexpected turn. The incidents that are driven by the characters are so natural, and that is the highest point of this show. If I need to pick some negative aspects of the show, then it would be the scale which is very small. It's not a world problem, or a danger to a society. It's basically a family squabble which makes me think that this shows meant to be a movie, but split into 6 episodes. Anyway, with this kind of pacing, storytellng, and character development. I'm confident that upcoming netflix show from mr. Yeon, Parasyte: The Grey will be good.",

Hellbound tackles the issue of religion and the dangers of cultish behavior, Jung-E is a family story packaged in an action drama, and this one, once again tackles familial relationships but in a much different arena. And there's always something humane at the core of these shows that grounds them, despite some of the outlandish scenarios. What happens when absolute devotion to your family pushes you to do irrational things; what happens when lack of devotion creates similar outcomes?

This psycho drama about a veteran profiler trying to solve a potential serial murder case with his own daughter involved somehow in at least one of the deaths takes you on quite a ride.This show is not for casual viewing, as you will need to pay attention to keep up with quite a few key characters introduced in the first few episodes. As I've mentioned, the first half of this show has been incredibly good. I certainly hope the second part can deliver what it promises.The storyline is captivating and the acting is top notch. You'll find yourself immersed in this story from the get go and will find yourself trying to investigate and solve the case along with the characters.Since the show has more episodes to be delivered and you never know if the show is going to go off a cliff somehow, so I'll reserve further comment.

She does not feel empathy for anyone and when she shows emotions in public they are just made up to fool people to make them do what she wants - or to hide who or what she really is.The police profiler has to solve one last case before he moves somewhere else with his daughter.During the investigation of the murder of a young girl the police profiler begins to suspect his daughter of being the killer.The longer the investigation goes the more evidence leads to her as the culprit.We also learn that the police profiler has also been suspecting his daughter of having killed her little brother when she was about 12.Then he discovers that during the current police investigation his daughter has been snooping around his files and then destroyed a piece of evidence (some little fuzzy red cat pendant) which would have linked her directly to the murder.The police profiler then confronts his daughter and asks her directly if she had killed the young girl a few days ago.She just stands up and without emotions asks her father instead: \"Do you REALLY think my little brother died from an accident - and do you REALLY think mom committed suicide?\"Wooooooooooooo.......I really can't wait to see the next episode!",

        "body":"Doubt... doubt... and more doubt. These doubts only lead to bigger problems.Why can't people just ask directly instead of merely doubting? So many issues wouldn't arise if we simply asked and listened for answers. This TV show brilliantly captures the role of doubt in the world we live in.Every episode is a masterfully crafted thriller. The scenes with the father and daughter are so intense that they leave the viewer breathless.I've watched a lot of TV shows this year but I believe this one is the best of 2024. Sometimes, after watching shows, I found out I got something very helpful and valuable for my life. This is one of them.",

        "body":"Doubt is so much more than just a mind-bending psychological thriller. It's a deep dive into the messy, heartbreaking complexities of family relationships. As much as the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat, it's the emotional weight behind the characters' struggles that really hits hard.And then there's Han Suk-kyu. I can't even begin to express how amazing he is in this role. Every scene is a masterclass in subtlety, whether he's showing the weight of his character's guilt or the raw emotion of someone trying to salvage the wreckage of his life. His acting is so layered & nuanced that you can practically feel every bit of pain and longing he's going through.The directing, cinematography, and BGM make this drama a cinematic experience. A solid 10\/10!",

The writing stood out the most-each scene felt so carefully crafted, with twists that left me speechless.This drama is a prime example of quality content, and what sets it apart is its cinematography, screenplay, and the unpredictability of the plot. The dynamic interactions between the characters and the way different aspects of each character were portrayed was truly captivating. The show lived up to its title \"Doubt\" and maintained its suspense all the way through to the final episode.I wouldn't recommend this drama to just anyone, as it may not be cup of tea for everyone. Not everyone appreciates the depth of slow-burn thrillers. However, this drama is a perfect representation of how a slow-burn thriller should unfold. It never felt boring because the characters were engaging enough to keep you hooked.For anyone who hasn't watched it yet, watch it without a \"doubt\" 😄 it's not just a show, it's an emotional journey.

        "body":"The plot is very good, however, perhaps with the intention of adding more drama, the director presents us with excessively long scenes, so long that they even look like still shots, which makes the development a bit slow and boring. Despite this detail, the characters seem to adapt very well to this slow style of telling the story, where the performance of the suspicious daughter and the profiler stand out in an outstanding way, even giving the impression of having worked with this director in other opportunities. Describing the style as slow is not intended as a negative criticism, on the contrary, given that this is a drama and suspense series in which each episode gives us more questions than answers, it may be of interest to that audience that loves to be kept on the edge of the couch without a single clue about the outcome.",

        "body":"Doubt as a series is not a psychological drama, but an unnecessarily stretched-to-the-max attempt to a thriller. The profiler character is a police officer who sometimes paces away with -or utters- a clue (we will never know how he got to his conclusions, but he is a profiler so why question his methods). The daughter (who is a suspect) is someone who refuses to explain her actions to anyone. But is perma-angry that she is a suspect. The series pace is painfully slow, I fear that this is what some confuse with psychological. It completely ruined the story for me. I found myself skipping parts, skipping episodes and still very much able to follow the clue in the last part. So: poorly worked-out characters and motivations, super slow pace, nonsensical attitudes. The best actors to me are officer Gu Dae-Hong (played by Roh Jae-Won) and criminal Choi Young-Min (played by Kim Jung-Jin). I found the rest utterly forgettable.",

The writing and dialog are realistic so it never feels makjang. The story is plausible and believable and that makes it moving. The main characters are both wrong and right good and not so good. Lots of tears and angst do be prepared. Forgiveness revenge betray are explored in an intelligent manner. The ending is complete and satisfying enough for this kind of tragedy drama. The musical score is suitable quite operatic and grand at times. The direction is clear and classy and the cinematography is top quality. The acting and cast are very good. Kim Nam Joo plays the grieving mother without overacting so she is effective. Kim Kang Woo is good at playing the slightly flawed husband who hides something. Cha Eun Woo shakes off his glamorous rom com idol persona quite well to play the troubled and complex victim and avenger although the blue collar parts are a little like a fake photoshoot.I wasn't bored with the 14 episodes because it was that good.

        "body":"♻ \"Everything started with the incident that summer.\" What started was a cycle of hurts followed by vengeance between parties on the periphery. Meanwhile, the 🕷 relaxed smugly in the center of the 🕸.The opening episode is heartbreaking. Eun \"Soo\" Hyun is a successful writer who is married to a reporter. They have a beautiful son together, but he disappears one afternoon when he is 6, leaving a single shoe on the sidewalk. Emergency crews eventually find him, but he's badly injured from a hit-and-run. He doesn't make it. After the perp's trial in which he's released, and it appears connections and corruption are playing a hand in the leniency he's granted, Soo falls apart. Her husband falls apart. Everything falls apart.WW is a 2024 release that is rated 86 on AWiki. It is 1 season consisting of 14 60ish-minute episodes. It is painful to watch. I could only handle 1 ep\/day. The pressure doesn't start to let up until ep11 or so, when the main characters make a directional change. Like the best among us do, Soo takes her pain and attempts to channel it for good. She sets out to protect other children from suffering like her son did. Before all of that, though, she is compelled to dispose of some trash.Her reward for taking out the 🗑 is a prison stint. She bonds with another inmate, Jang Hyung Ja. Soo's new friend is in jail because she had set fire to the room where her husband was having an affair and ended up killing several people, including an entire family, save for their 8 year old boy who survived. Jang Hyung Ja elicits Soo's commitment to contact that boy upon her release as it looks like Jang Hyung Ja will never be released: She's dying. She's too ashamed to face the kid anyway. As it turns out, this 8-year-old boy, who is now grown up, is loosely involved with disrupting corrupt men. Meanwhile, Soo's husband has been investigating🔎 connections between the man who caused the accident that killed their son and his corrupt cronies, including judges and politicians.By the time Soo is released, her husband is on foreign assignment. The one time she accepted his visit during her incarceration was to tell him to leave her be - She had nothing left for him. On the first day of freedom Soo falls asleep on her son's grave and wakes to a young angelic looking man holding an ☂ over her. Does she know how he will factor into her future? Of course not. Right now she's an aimless wanderer. No direction. Nothing to live for. Dead inside. Yet she promised Gunwoo, her son, that she would survive and live a meaningful life. The first order of business is her promise to Jang Hyung Ja to find that boy who survived the fire.Soo finds her cellie's 8 y\/o victim; it's the boy with the umbrella. Otherworldly looking Cha Eun Woo (Rookie Historian-7.6, True Beauty, My ID Is Gangnam Beauty-7.5) portrays Kwon Seon Yul, now fully grown. Soo sees that he's not living a quiet, safe life. He also isn't pleased to get the message she's delivering. He shuns her, but they continue to meet. It's as if strange forces are drawing them together.To err is human; to forgive, divine. Forgiveness, release, and going on with life is WW's theme. Not only are there huge things to forgive, like the killing of a family member, but also cheating, lying, general indiscretions, and everyday insults are thrown in the path as well. Mistakes are creating roadblocks all over the place. Most of the characters in WW have committed grave blunders and have also been greatly wronged. Once forgiven, a perpetrator may feel release, but the person who benefits most from forgiving is the one who is doing it. It isn't easy (not by any means!) but to hold onto anger, unforgiveness, and bitterness is to rot oneself out from within. It is the opposite of a free life. It is being controlled.\"I won't ask for forgiveness...\" we hear that several times. The logic behind the statement is that the wrongdoers feel too much shame to 'ask for forgiveness'. So don't. Don't ask to be forgiven. However, a person that has done wrong should apologize - without excuses, qualifiers, demands, or reservations. That is what decency demands. It's what a person of good character and principles does. A mature person will understand that everyone makes mistakes. Learn from them, make it right and move on, burden free. An immature and self-absorbed person will turn an apology into an excuse fest, a look-at-me-I-am-not-so-bad-think-better of-me party. Pathetically, this doesn't work, it only shows poor character, and it doesn't make anyone like you more. Denying one's mistakes and not apologizing is a form of living in denial and lies. One can't face h\/h shortcomings because s\/he needs to think better of h\/h self. That is a contemptible life of delusion. Let your ego go. Nobody else likes your ego; only you do. Let it go. Be free.😢 Going into ep9 ain't nobody free. All I could think is: 'What a downer! This show is so sad!' Just in time (almost too late), there's a plot shift that allows the viewer some breathing room. Things move into the deep end, more evidence comes to light, and not everything is what it had previously appeared to be.WW is a quality production. The acting, directing, and writing all supplement the show. Kim Nam Joo (Misty) is FL Eun \"Soo\" Hyun. Kim Kang Woo (Circle) plays Kang Soo Ho, Soo's husband. The intrinsically likable Kang Ae Shim from Bad and Crazy & Be Melodramatic-8.7 plays Jang Hyung Ja.Kil Hae Yeon (If You Wish Upon Me) is Jung Myung Hee, Soo'smother i\/l. This woman excels at playing a supreme b!+ch. I've seen her in Beyond Evil-7.4 & Law School-8. I've also seen her in 2 shows that are like stamps of eachother: In Something in the Rain-8.6 she plays the ultimate narcissistic mother who ruins her family. One Spring Night-7.8 is nearly the same show (same director\/writer combo) except it's the father who's a narcissist and Ms Kil is a sweetheart of a mom. Both shows are good, but OSN is like the 2nd, lighter stamp. It doesn't mean much on its own, its value is as a follow-up to the heavier, gut-wrenching Something in the Rain. Regardless, this actress has a powerful presence.Im Se Mi (Terius Behind Me, When the Weather Is Fine-9) is Han Yoo Ri, Soo's BFF and unofficial sister. Won Mi Kyung (The Hoechun Gate, Great Vocation) plays Oh Go Eun, Soo's mom. I've only seen her in My Unfamiliar Family-7.9, and she's wonderful. The screenwriter is Kim Ji Eun (Lie After Lie) and Lee Seung Young (Voice S2, Special Affairs Team TEN) directed.The direction is competent with flashes of excellence. The color palette is dark, muted and grey, but the colors in Soo's memories are so vivid! The tempo is steady. The show never rushes and it never drags. Stopping at 14 episodes may have been the smartest thing the director did. Too many shows suffer because they don't have enough content to fill 16-20 episodes competently. The 🎶 is quite good as well. The classic, Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive, makes an appearance and Imaginary Future & Kina Grannis do a melancholy, jazzy cover of What a Wonderful World.🌱 Soo is able to find justice, release, and peace by the time the credits roll. This painful show ends up with a positive message that is brilliantly summed up when Soo declares this:\n\"Let's not live like a bare tree anymore. Let's sprout and live.\" Only free people can say and do that.QUOTES📢In the middle of life's journey, I got lost and wandered. I've heard no matter how much time passes, losing someone precious to you will always be lonesome. But I will try to keep going. If I keep going, one day the pain will lessen. I hope all those grieving find comfort. I hope the world will be more friendly to those in pain. I hope a beautiful world will come while you overcome your pain.When you live this long, leaving someone properly is as important as meeting someone.〰🖍 IMHO📣7.5 📝8 🎭8.3 🎨7.6 🎵\/🔊7 🔚8.3 ▪ 🌞4⚡4.5 😅1 😭5 😱2 😯5 🤢2 🤔6 💤0Age 14+\nMature subject matter.Re-📺?

Love the female lead coz she's such a great actress. It's the first time seeing her here. Every character in this story is so intriguing and this is possibly my fave role for Cha Eun Woo. I've seen him in romantic comedies, fantasy, but never in an intense drama and thriller like this. His acting fits his role even if he's too attractive for the role he's playing. It's an ongoing series and I can't wait for the next episode! I think a lot of moms can resonate with this show as well as married couples. What I am mostly anticipating is Cha Eun Woo's real identity and intentions. He seems to have a hidden agenda based from what I've seen so far, and also from the beginning, the hook used was foreshadowing. It seemed like he was mad at the female lead and he was about to run her over. I think he might be the son of the guy that the female lead killed.",

While you would think you understand the plot and the characters, the more you watch the more complex it gets and nothing is as it seems to be. The actors are delivering a great performance bringing you from tears to anger, love and hatred! This drama sees the return of the queen Kim Namjoo as the mother of the child. Cha Eunwoo delivers an exceptional performance, far from the roles that made him famous like True Beauty. They both take us on a journey that will change them forever. This TV drama is a must watch.

His on-screen presence shines bright, elevating the overall quality of the drama and earning him well-deserved praise for his performance. In summary, \"Wonderful World\" is a must-watch drama, and Cha Eunwoo's standout performance is a highlight that adds to its appeal. His talent and dedication to his craft shine through, making him a rising star to watch out for in the Korean entertainment industry.",

The cast and crew are good especially Kin Ji-Soo. Yet to see Ji Jin-Hee's character development but both of them are good actors regardless.The negative part of the drama is definitely Son Na-Eun. Honestly that lady can't act and I don't understand how she is being casted. Throughout the two episodes her reaction are literally the same be it when she faints, when she exhausted, when she is overworked, when she cry, when she is angry my god there are no variations at all in terms of her expression of the emotions. She's definitely going to be the negative point of the drama should it has good storyline.",

The daughter is deeply resentful and very angry. The son pleased. The mother unsure. The father (ML) is now wealthy and has purchased the Apartment Block where the family live so now he is their new Landlord. He aims to win his wife (and family) back.The second part is the relationship between his daughter and the young security guard where she works who incidentally is the CEOs son. It's a toss up between the prodigal father and the angry daughter who gets the most air time and attention in this series. Occasionally the daughter was rather tiresome, yet understandable so, with her anger. She has taken over the protector role of the house looking out for her mother and younger neer do well brother. Her fathers' return makes huge changes to her life which her mother eventually acknowledges, recognising that she has to let her daughter be a young woman and not \"the man in the house\".This is an interesting and different trope from the usual Kdramas. Yes there are other relationships including the Hair Salon owner and the Tax Accountant. Also the other residents in the other apartments in the Block. Most are middle aged, which is a blessed relief, and different, amongst all the usual hand holding young people. Whats interesting is they all have a past, that they either want to forget and move on from to live better lives. This series tries to show that it is recognised and acknowledged. At 50 yo you think carefully, deeper and acknowledge your own personal errors compared to being 30 yo and still screaming in fury!The actors are not particularly brilliant or well known, but then again not bad. Only one I recognise is Kim Ji-Soo playing the Security Guard\/CEO son and he is (IMO) not a very good actor just eye candy.Although the Dads neighbours focus on where he got his money from, the writer clearly using this to drive the story along, the final information is a bit of a damp squid when told the truth!The series end comfortably and quietly, no major melodrama.I liked it but wouldn't hunt it out to watch again.Korean audio with English subtitles.",

I do look away and just listen when she's on the screen. And her storyline doesn't help her cause. This could have been a fun caper!

Story was more about family struggles than romance though as the title might suggest, and the family struggles didn't really interest me that much other than the security guard's career struggle.Starts off as a murder mystery when the place burns down but later turns into a ridiculous story that didn't seem that humorous to me.

This series has one main plot and many sub plot but I think director forget about main plot and focusing on many sub plots. In Main plot story has two leads which is daughter (son na-eun) and Father (ji jin-hee) but interaction between them is very limited and in full series they have never sorted out their issues. Father act likes teen and even daughter also not looks like very mature which is claimed in story many times. From Rom-com perspectives no couple has touching chemistry they all looks too dull and comedy is also very lame. I saw ji jin-hee in DP2, his role is very limited there but In limited role he show his capability and how good he can act. I saw kim ji-soo in hwarang and she can act very good too but this is director's fault if he can't use that level of talented actors.

Because this basic character paradox is never really answered by episode 10,a lot is expected from the audience in terms of forgiving him, and imagining that he can reconcile with his wife and family. The 10 episodes are in this way a bit of an endurance contest and not satisfying.The subplot of the daughters romance with the son of her boss also has its issuesThe story of the daughter and mother, as they discover the way in which their relationship has been twisted by the trauma they have been through is the highlight of the drama.The father is very watchable, the other stars Not so much.

While the plot holds promise, certain aspects leave viewers yearning for a more finely tuned execution.Strengths:\nEngaging Plotlines:\n\"Red Swan\" weaves together multiple storylines, each with its own layer of mystery. The central premise-a secret society manipulating events-holds immense potential.The tension builds steadily, drawing viewers into a web of conspiracy, betrayal, and hidden motives.Character Dynamics:\nThe ensemble cast delivers commendable performances. Their interactions, conflicts, and hidden agendas create a palpable sense of unease.Yoo Ji-hoon's enigmatic character, in particular, keeps us guessing.Areas for Improvement:\nStoryboard Balance:\nThe pacing occasionally falters. Some episodes feel rushed, while others linger too long on secondary plotlines.A more consistent rhythm would enhance the viewing experience.Realism vs. Suspense:\nWhile the mysterious elements are intriguing, the show occasionally sacrifices realism for shock value. Characters make improbable choices, and certain plot twists strain credibility.Striking a better balance between suspense and believability would elevate the storytelling.Predictability:\nThe mystery's resolution becomes apparent too early for seasoned viewers. A more intricate puzzle-one that challenges our deductive abilities-would heighten the suspense.Visual Aesthetics:\nThe cinematography captures the urban landscape beautifully, but some scenes lack visual flair. A more stylized approach could enhance the show's overall impact.Final Thoughts:\n\"Red Swan\" has the ingredients for greatness-a compelling premise, strong performances, and a shadowy world waiting to be explored. With adjustments to pacing, realism, and plot intricacy, it could soar to greater heights. As viewers, we remain hopeful that subsequent seasons will refine the narrative and deliver the edge-of-your-seat experience we crave.",

Once found on Hulu (at the bottom of the search results, after multiple hits for anything red or dawn dating back 40 years), I attempted to watch with the cheaper ads version, but the quantity of ads was impossible to bear.Still committed to watching the series in the best light possible, I forked over $17.99 for a month to watch the series ad-free. Now, micro second black screen interruptions have replaced the ads and reveal the jilting production transitions between scenes.Skipping the technical flaws, the storyline is just too over the top with the evil in-laws and cheating husband.

And for the female lead; you both have chemistry for me, even though I feel jealous of how she can easily touch and hit you. Also, your stare in episode 2, my gosh, you make me so jealous. Hope you're doing well. Happy anniversary! I watched the live and saw how you're feeling better. It's only the second day since the drama release, but you had to perform. Anyways, more shows and events for you and members this year and in the future. Lovelots from your fan. By the way, I can't promise to watch on time, but I will finish this drama. Episode 2 left me hanging for days. Ahhh, this feeling makes me want to scream. Your character is superb to me because of your emotional changes; I hope it ends well and you don't get killed. I love the characters. I think the guy who drinks with the female lead was the guy in your last series, 'Behind Your Touch.' is he right? Looking forward to more superb acting from you and the whole cast.\"",

        "body":"Spin off to the popular story \"Bossam: Steal the Fate\", the story is another political historical fiction cooking through palace dramas.The opening of any drama plays a significant role in drawing the attention of the audience. In this story, the drama opens at a slow pace. The introduction of important characters was not surprising but cliche. The scene opens through a night, with robed people carefully walking through the palace gate. The director tried to use darkness to intensify the schemes being plotted behind those thick walls. It took a while to shape the story and establish the main aspect. The Queen's mother, her immediate hands, and constant plots - all-star players of this drama remained powerless throughout.There are many historical fiction which have been stealing the hearts of audiences even after many years of release. Call it Scarlett Heart Ryeo or Empress KI- these dramas intrigued audiences through the well-laid plot. This is where The Missing Crown Prince lacked. It failed to generate interest among viewers.Suho in the titular role tries his best to deliver a vivacious prince who is cheerful and trying his best to survive through the thick and thins of a gruesome palace. His chemistry with leading lady Hong Ye Ji lacks the spice due to the narrowness of the plot. The huge holes in the beginning made the story bland.",

Omg, I do hope he makes more movies and dramas as I am now a big fan.The FC opposite him - Ye Ji {?} was a tough cookie who stood no nonsense from men and was ready to fight and protect the weak. But she turns to mush when she meets her future husband to be, not knowing he was the Crown Prince. I wish she had been selected for Hwarang. Better actress.The romance blooms with these two and they are soon entangled with the evil plans of the Royal Physician, Queen Dowager and the Left Councillor - who all try to wrest for power to make changes which would benefit them and their clans politically.Loved the cast and as mentioned, I hope there will be more from Suho. Did not know him till I watched this drama. Am now a fan of his singing as well. He is from group EXO. He also sang the OST for Missing Crown Prince - Love you more gradually.My fav song for the month.",

I've already started formulating theories about the storyline and what might happen next. The actors, while playing somewhat stereotypical roles, manage to infuse their performances with a unique charm that really makes them stand out. I was particularly surprised by Suho's acting. If I hadn't known he was an idol first, I might have assumed his primary career was in acting. He brings a natural, comical touch to his character, Yi Geon, and his chemistry with the rest of the cast is surprisingly good too. I'm particularly looking forward to more scenes with the lead actress.However, I hope the show doesn't pivot entirely towards romance and keeps its focus on the political issues it's begun to explore. As much as I'm enjoying the development of the plot and characters, the wait between episodes is almost unbearable. I generally prefer binge-watching, especially when it comes to historical dramas, but this series is promising enough that I'm willing to follow it week by week.

As typical in some of these dramas the \"older\" actors were much better. The leading lady was such a joke, her crying scenes were the fakest yet. Between her and Suho there was no chemistry. The grand prince had more acting chops but even he paled in comparison to the king, queen dowager, and head physician. Overall I only finished watching this series to say I did and to see it to the end. Each week I forgot it was even on and was happy to watch anything else. A waste of time and I'm super disappointed.

The FL didn't improve to impress me much since I last rated. Would have liked to up my rating due to Lamon's acting but the overall drama kept my rating the same.Original rating of 6 stars - Branding in Seongsu has some positives to it and some things I don't like about it. First, love the theme of branding - I thought the ideas I saw here are ingenious. Loved the pharmacy idea which was both humorous and would be a great idea in real life if placed in the right areas. Also loved the Whiskey idea - very different concept too. The humorous and sexiness of the branding comes across. Love the subtle comical moments overall in the series so far as well. What creeps me out though is that when they switch souls I can't fantom kissing yourself romantically basically - you know what I mean..... just creepy. Worse than the thought of \"kissing cousins\" or the phrase \"go \"F\" yourself? As far as the casting goes, (Lomon Park Solomon), plays So Eun Ho the utmost best. Looking forward to seeing more of him in the future as well. When he was switched into the female soul his confidence just shined through. On the other hand the FL to me didn't give as good of a vibe when they were switched. Didn't like the attempt of acting with masculine traits .#BrandingInSeongsu\n#BrandingInSeongsuDong\n#ParkSolomon\n#Lomon\n#SwitchingSouls.",

Maybe 10 episodes is a little more than necessary but that's neither here nor there.I've read some reviews in the press and they are, shall we say, mixed but I suppose you either like this kind of thing or you don't.Most of the negative reviews seem to be fixated on Saudi Arabia somehow being offended. Ignore them, let them get back to their misogyny and chopping off citizens' heads while the rest of us enjoy our Chicken Nugget!",

The Korean title is \"dakgangjeong\", which are deep fried chicken pieces covered in a sweet and spicy sauce. That has nothing to do with a chicken nugget.... And even in the series, the chicken bits look more like chicken balls rather than dakgangjeong... I was very confused...\nThat's all about the series, when you can't even get that right, there's no point going any further...So, Netflix is on a rampage capitalising on Korea, as it has became the new trend.Recently, there have been tons of webtoon adaptations (Death's game, Pyramid game, A killer paradox, The bequeathed, duty after school etc...), which is just the new lazy and easy way of making a K-series. Webtoons themselves are kind of a lazy way to make a manga.What I can see in general, is a drop in quality. Years ago, before American streaming companies started mass producing Korean series, I used to think that Korean series were way better than the rest. Unfortunately, this is not the case anymore, and it seems that nowadays, mediocre and second-rate productions for an avid Occidental audience is just the usual.",

The actors do a fantastic job, and the directing is masterous. I don't remember when I laughed this much while watching a K Drama last time.This silly, comedic, probably relatively small budget drama based on a webtoon is a million times better than most recent dramas I've seen in months. No matter how silly it is, it takes itself seriously to the point where it's just beautiful instead of silly. And besides the sillyness, it has heart felt moments and it is very real, even sad, at times.This reminds me of the good old K Drama's South Korea used to make. There's just something totally unique about this. The 30 minute run-time also gives it a needed freshness that most dragging 1h-1.5h dramas filled with a punch of filler lack.The two male leads and all side actors are fantastic. But I have to give extra credit to Kim You-jung who plays the girl who turns into the nugget. At least to me, she is probably the most beautiful actress in all of Korea right now, yet her beauty is no match to her talent. An absolutely phenomenal actress who makes this show even better than it has any right to be.Give it a go, you will be surprised by how good it is. K Dramas need these shows more than you'd think. There really ain't a lot of them anymore. Clearly this was made with love. Something that lacks nowadays. Everyone who worked on this should be proud.Solid 10\/10, would recommend in a heart beat.

Decay, decomposition, dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power.\"Sometimes I wonder whether the world is being run by smart people who are putting us on, or by imbeciles who really mean it,\" ~ Mark Twain. Even if leaders want the right things, too often they do the wrong things to get them.US is a historical political fiction thriller based on true events. Three characters are based on actual historical figures while everyone else seems to be an amalgam of other players that created the political debacle of 1959-60 in SK, Uncle Sam being the most amalgamous. Communism was spreading, the 🌍 was in chaos. World War II had rewritten the maps. N & S Korea were at odds. 🇰🇷 was closely monitored by an on-site 🇺🇸military. This is one of director\/writer Shin Youn-Shick's higher rated offerings. \"I think 🇰🇷 is the only country that asks if one has eaten as a greeting. (US) portrays the difficult times right after the Korean War, when it was truly challenging to have even one meal a day,\" Shin said. Yet it was politics as usual at the top. These back-room ghouls think nothing of the suffering masses.Not interested? I gravitate to the imaginative side of 📽&📚 myself - Sci-fi\/fantasy\/romance. One could tag me a reluctant viewer. Around ep5 it became clear that this is an excellent drama. It starts like a tank. It grinds slowly but really cranks up towards the end. The acting & directing are sublime. What's most important is that it's a peek under the hood of politics, another reminder that politics is overrun by hoods. \"This is what it means to be in politics,\" muses Joo In-tae. His daughter had just asked him how he could work w\/ a guy who had tortured him during the 🇯🇵 occupation. Many well meaning people do jump into the \"public service\" foray w\/ the intent to 'do-good', but they slowly get absorbed by a system that pumps out 'doo-doo'. Politics is one big manure spreader. As KS says, it's \"Hypocrisy disguised as a dream.\"1960. The March15 Election Fraud is abt the rigged re-election of Syngman Rhee, in power since post WWII. That led to The April Revolution: Protests & demonstrations demanding reform led to the removal of Rhee. US opens in 1960, but the cars look older, indicating that money is scarce & they're getting by on older tech. On a dark, wet night authorities are dragging away a man who is screaming that it's Samsik's fault. What is a Samsik? Well, he is a dude who made sure everyone in his circle had three meals a day. Even during the war. \"Sam\" means three. \"Sik\" means food. \"Chingoo Chincha.\" A true friend.US is a primer on politics & the slippery slope. The good they sincerely want to do is the 🥕 ~ Getting reelected is the 🏏. It helps me understand & despise politics all the more. The cliche, \"Power corrupts,\" et al, still rings true. We haven't outgrown that problem. Voters & the GP seem to have the attention span of a fruit fly & the memory of an ostrich. We neither know nor understand our history which dooms us to suffer corrupt leadership. It just isn't wise to put too much trust or hope in political leaders.After we hear what a nurturing guy US Is, we revert to 1959. There's protesters in Seoul. I've not seen one political Kdrama where that isn't going on. It appears to be a nat'l pastime. US goes back & forth between that point & MPs questioning suspects in 1960. Questions? In '59 these guys staged a coup.Samsik is more mobster than businessman. He's slowly built up enough to buy into a chaebol - he's about to become a business baron. \"Do you know what 🍕 is?\" He's in a great mood & jawwing to someone at the meal before his induction ceremony. \"You probably don't even know what cheese is.\" He tries to explain 🍕 to a 1959 Korean. It might as well be explaining the 5th dimension. Try explaining soy sauce to someone who has never had Asian cuisine.Next, he's at a political rally to raise trouble, & the meeting does break up in mayhem, but then KS takes the podium. In effect, he says ~ I just got back from 🇺🇸. Every building shines. No one is going hungry. They don't even eat all their food. I lived above a pizza shop. Do any of you know what 🍕 is? ~ He goes on to talk of a vision where Koreans aren't starving but, rather, where Korea is the center for commerce in the 🌎. Uncle Sam is listening. Attentively. The scene is quite powerful.Park Doo Chil (Snowpiercer) plays ML US w\/ his coat swinging; part of Sam's signature swagger. It's been 35 yrs since he did 📺. Coming into US, I could only see him as he was in Parasite-9, w\/ the greasy face & that smell. (I KNOW one can't smell anything through the 📺. That is partly why Parasite is so brilliant!) He made an impression. He's excellent in Taxi Driver-8.4 as well, which is also half-fictionalized events based in a true setting and, historically, serves as a bookend to US. In US, PDC is indefatigable. His character is so alive, so energetic, so garrulous, so thoroughly compelling that, for someone w\/ chronic fatigue, it's actually exhausting. He understands that when your stomach is full your mind tends to open. He won people over by feeding them. We're not that much different from stray cats & dogs in that way. He is portrayed as a split personality. Like the best criminals, he's a savant of human psychology. He grew up poor. Therefore he says things like: \"Do you like people that are admired? They're the worst.\" Yet he fully embraces the system. He is fundamentally decent to those around him & he's generally loyal, but he has no moral backbone whatsoever. US is a man that has gotten used to exploiting opportunities; it's such a habit that he never questions it. He operates outside of the law entirely. He opens up in ep2: 'I love red bean buns. I could never afford them, but I wanted them so badly I killed a man one day.'Byun Yo Han, who is positively luminescent in Mr. Sunshine-9 & Misaeng-9.1, plays Kim San\/KS, a man who has the best of intentions but gets marinated & stuck to the bottom by the political sauce. Mr. Byun shows that he can play a serious role. Other actors can as well, but what other actors can't do is capture the magic of the other characters BYH has portrayed. He conveys a nearly tangible sense of delight. That is rare magic, indeed. KS has a soft spot for people that recognize his worth. That only means that he's too self-focused, & his pride is too important to him. It's something that will trip us up. He is so determined to pass his economic reform pkg, (it would be wonderful for Kcountry) that he's willing to do anything. ANYTHING. He thinks he can wash away the stink later.KS is courted more than a duke's only daughter. How does Samsik seduce him? With intoxicating statements like this: \"Nobody gets to fulfill more than 25% of their desires. Nobody gets 80 or 90% so what do you do? You increase your desires by 40-50-60%. Have ambition.\" When KS finally succumbs, he has this conversation w\/ the party chief: \"I don't need nice guys. We are waging a war here. I won't tolerate any tears.\" \"I've already shed all my tears. I'm done w\/ that.\" By that time he had abandoned his fiance, ignored dozens of illegalities, & had started sewing the seeds of revolution. Samsik stays in the shadows. One might almost think he invented subversive triangulation, but apparently politics is the same at all times & in all places. It's a filthy business in which those in power take advantage of those in need. Catch rivals committing crimes? It's merely an invitation to control them. Turning them in is the last thing that US would do. Even so, Samsik & KS form an unbreakable bond. They have good goals that they intend to implement by any means possible. Following proper channels never even occurs to Samsik, & he manages to slowly & steadily bend KS to his will.It's always the things that we think we know ~ our faulty presuppositions ~ that bring us down. \"There was an explosion of people that spilled onto the streets instantly. Ultimately, none of the promises or plans we made mattered at all... No one could have predicted the way the winds would take us, or or how the waves would crash.\" The director builds up tension steadily. It explodes into protests. There's a spectacular moving aerial shot of marchers that pans several blocks. He intersperses the filming w\/ genuine newsreels from the time. It's quite emotional. Another nice touch is how KS is gifted a light grey suit that stands out amongst the unified dark suit coalition. I think it represents how his white intentions became muddied & gray through his interactions w\/ US. In the last ep KS wears a black suit & glasses of 2 shades of grey.US can sense things are going sideways in the last ep. He looks at the hotel lobby. People are chit-chatting, drinking & going on w\/ their evening as if nothing's happening. They're completely unaware of the day, of the country, & of the rotation & revolution of the 🌎. Isn't that always the case? The soldiers enter. It's a profound scene.US, himself, is often profound. We'll let him close this out: \"...Can you feel it right now? The rotation & revolution? That's precisely the kind of man I am. The Earth's rotation & revolution...\" (looks like the earth still goes around without him). \"Sometimes I feel... I feel tossed aside in the world, completely abandoned. I'm flooded w\/ loneliness. It's in those times that I find what I fear most of all... is when that loneliness... becomes familiar.QUOTES📢People think they're different from each other.

I loved the main characters, Sam-sik and Kim San. There was a solid amount of action that was well balanced with what was going on politically in South Korean politics in the late 1950's\/early 60's (and even if the characters are fake, it's still an interesting glimpse into that time in history.I may have found this mini series more interesting than some people might, due to the fact that my Grandfather served in the Korean war. He was an incredible man but a man of very few words when it came to talking about his time there.It was a little bit challenging trying to read the subtitles in English because I wasn't reading quite fast enough before it switched to the next subtitles, but after an episode or 2, I was able to keep up.I haven't finished the entire show yet (since half of it hasn't been released at this time) but I'm now on episode 8, and I feel like I enjoy the show more with every episode I watch. Well done to everyone involved and I'd recommend watching this.",

        "body":"Okay, it's time to pick off another ep of BF. ⏱... ⏲... Where is it? What's wrong with my continue-watching...? Where's the beef? Hulu?WHAT!?!That's all there is? Just 10 eps? A cliffhanger?I'm usually bringing up the rear guard and watching the older shows, which are all completed, so I haven't had this happen to me in a long time. Now I have to wait for S2 and it hasn't even been announced yet, smh.Don't let that scare you. Unless people watch it, they won't make another season, and we should get another season of BF. It's excellent and has the potential to be a 9+. I've held back because it ain't over yet. As is, it's quite a rush. Let's get into its DNA.He's got what she needs.Ju Ji Hoon (Hyena, Kingdom-8.3) is Woo Chae Woon. He's ex-mil and now high-level security. He's about more than babysitting CEOs, though. He's on a mission to uncover the truth about a terrorist bombing that took place under his watch where he was one of the base commanders overseas. He's one of those guys - Like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. He's lethal. Usually more like a statue in the corner, he doesn't show much emotion.Han Hyo Joo (Moving, W) is Blood Free's CEO, Yoon Ja Yoo. With her background in the sciences, she's quite stoic herself. Hints surface of past traumas. She started the company, which makes cultured meat, in order to provide human beings with a drug, parasite, and cruelty-free food supply. Things are going well. They've released their beef and are preparing to launch their seafood line. Just wait and see what they get into next.Our ML's resume fits our FL's job search parameters so perfectly that she's suspicious. She's not stupid, afterall. Yet Ji-hoon gradually gains her trust, then her admiration, then more. Plus he's a good cat-dad. Men that like cats are largely secure with themselves. It's a good sign.BF is a 2024 release that is rated 88 on AWiki. It is 1 season consisting of a MERE 10 50-minute episodes. Screenwriter, Lee Soo Yeon, also wrote the popular Stranger. Instant stardom: This is director Park Chul Hwan's 1st effort. Wow. Other main players are Lee Hee Joon (Mouse) as PM Seon Woo Jae, and as aids to the powerful are Lee Moo Saeng (Cleaning Up, Maestra: Strings of Truth) playing On San, Jun Suk-ho Kingdom-8.3, Call It Love-8.4) is Seo Hui, and Park Ji Yeon (A Model Family) as Jung Hae Deun. Jeon Gook Hwan (Crash Landing on You-9.1, Empress Ki, and nearly everything else) is perfect as the former Prime Minister\/ grandfather to the current one. He actually loses it in one scene, which is something new. As one could imagine, it's frightening. He's everywhere because he's authentic.BF's successes in the lab threaten the power structure in K-country. The plot centers around corporate espionage and other intrigues. It's a hot second before the government steps on the mess and makes everything worse.BF touches on the cruelty of the meat industry, but only slightly. I've considered going vegetarian, but I'm not quite there yet. (A healthy person doesn't \"need\" meat but 2 or 3 times a week, if at all). Animal cruelty is just absolutely wrong. It is inexcusable. By now, the cruelty involved in the meat industry is common knowledge, so to be willfully blind to it is to be party to it. The world's major religions do not condone it, but regardless of belief-system, it is patently obvious that it's wrong to be cruel to animals. Most people should be able to rally around humane products. It would be wonderful if BF's innovations were not science fiction.There's a rich and powerful family depicted in which the grandfather, father, and son all have their own agendas and work at odds with eachother. So sad. This is contrasted with our ML who is making sacrifices for his niece and working for the sake of his lost comrades. He lives to bring them justice. It would be lovely to not have to worry about money. Sadly, many rich people don't manage to be happy, either. They develop habits and appetites, based on greed and pride, that can never be satisfied.The writing is just splendid. Only the most finicky left-brained types will object to the plot twists. I found viewing pleasure near frictionless - an easy glide. BF is slick as culture in a petri dish. It's weighty. The CEO has a tremendous burden on her and the viewer can feel it. They build tension steadily. Slick techno music accompanies the tense scenes. There's respectable action in ep3. As of ep7, BF develops into an excellent thriller. There's a Hollywood style gun battle in which our protagonists are quite fortunate in their ability to avoid being shot while being amazingly accurate with their own shooting skills. Still, it works. There's very cool VR search technology featured while the actor is using VR gloves (Like Minority Report). Save a life - A very cool medical device inhabits BF's basement (Like The Fifth Element-8.9 and Prometheus-8). \"Good artists copy, great artists steal,\" per Picasso (if he even came up with that. Whether that quote is his original words has been brought into question, in full-circle irony. It amuses me to think that he plfered that line). The camera work, acting, directing, writing all blend together to culture a quality product. One can't pilfer that. They constructed this excellent work one cell at a time.〰🖍 IMHO📣8.5 📝8.3 🎭8.5 💓6,🦋5 🎨8.2 🎵\/🔊7.8 🔚? ▪ 🌞3.3 ⚡7.8 😅1 😭5 😱4.5 😯4 🤢6 🤔5.5 💤0Age 15+ for Violence. BF is not Blood free.

Han hyo joo never disappoint me, the chemistry she has with her coworker, the PM and her bodyguard are soooo FABULOUS. There is just one flaw in this drama, why does it have to be just 10 episodes!? I need 5 seasons og this. I'm simping this drama. I think the drama doesnt get enough popularity because lack of promotions. Disney you better promotes the drama moreeee.

        "body":"*As an aside to address another review's criticism of the edit\/scene shifting, this is unfortunately common for Disney produced Kdramas, and should not reflect negatively on the work itself.For starters, I love this cast filled with favorites at their best. The first episode really draws you into the imperfect dream of living at the top of the food chain humanely. Unfortunately humans lack generosity, humility, and grace, especially those with money and power. I was immediately drawn into the concept, and kept at attention by the affects of the various mysterious characters and trying to figure out their angle.These more condensed Kdramas, due to less filler and more tightly woven storylines, can sometimes come across as rushed to those of us used to the more leisurely Kdrama stroll. But having seen and enjoyed several of them now, I've come to appreciate this style. There is little time to get distracted or bored because nearly each scene adds an important layer of detail and story progression.I found the ending quite intriguing. I find myself both satisfied by some aspects, and exceedingly excited about a more fully satisfying total conclusion. It's an interesting feeling to appreciate what they did there. I'm not frustrated, I'm excitedly anticipating. They really had better have that season 2, though. Highly recommend.",

        "body":"The premise of the show is interesting enough. The first episode quickly introduces the main characters and enough suspense to grab your attention. However, everything pretty much spins out of control thereafter. I'm on ep. 3 and I believe that's a good place to jump off. First of all, the ridiculously over dramatic music is impossible to ignore. Secondly, there is a scene where the show decides to show the audience an elaborate booting sequence for an AI system. It's as if the showrunners want to tell the audience \"hey, look at this awesome CG we incorporated into this show.\" However, it's completely unnecessary and almost laughable. Now, these are minor issues that most viewers would be willing to stomach. On the other hand, the plot holes and complete non-sense that the show tries to force feed will be less than palatable for most intelligent viewers. For example, the main female character does not trust her bodyguard. He's been on the job for one day, yes, just one day. Instead of reassigning him or simply firing him, there is a long drawn out scene with her confronting her bodyguard. There is nothing worse than creating a highly intelligent, competent character and making that character act unintelligent or incompetent, over and over, just to carry the story forward. Speaking of one day on the job, a lot of events take place throughout ep 2 and 3, and someone says \"it's only his first day on the job.\" That includes the entire living room and kitchen busted up in the afternoon, only to appear spotless within few hours when the guy returns to his home.In conclusion, it's an interesting story with very poor execution. Once the show is over, I may just read what happened. Not really interested in sitting through 8 full episodes.",

The cast is perfect as well with actors included so they add in an element of helping it all seem real with the expressions on their faces, etc. They get so into it that it is hard to figure out if someone is putting a little acting on or really scared - especially Kim Do-hoon who makes it so fun. Sometimes he is so funny too - a gentleman always taking on the dangerous tasks so the women don't have to do it but then is a scary-cat when doing it. So funny. The escape rooms and codes are all so technical I was curious if Kwang Soo from Season 20 (I'm Solo) had anything to do with helping design the rooms or codes, as if you watch the show you will know he is a premier escape room designer in Korea.

The initial episodes, while somewhat slow-paced, serve an important purpose: they introduce the cast of Korean influencers to a global audience that may not be familiar with them.The design of the games is a standout feature of the show. It is clear that the writers have invested significant thought into ensuring the games are fair, engaging, and a true measure of the influencers' abilities.One of the most intriguing aspects of the series is the opportunity to see the influencers outside of their usual context. This shift provides not only a fresh perspective for the viewers, but also a chance for the influencers themselves to engage in self-reflection.The production quality of the show is commendable, reflecting a high level of attention to detail.Moreover, the series has drawn comparisons to 'Black Mirror', and I find myself in agreement with this sentiment. 'The Influencer' raises thought-provoking questions that linger long after the end of each episode. The polarized reactions and active discussions across various platforms attest to the show's ability to engage viewers on a deeper level.In conclusion, 'The Influencer' is a well-crafted series that offers a unique and insightful look into the world of influencers.

        "body":"The show is based on a famous novel. I have not read the book, and even if I had, I would not compare the show to the book as I believe shows like these should be rated on their own merits. So, is this a show worthy of investing 15 hours or so of your viewing time? It's a maybe for some, but a definite \"No\" for me.The biggest problem with the show is the pacing. About midway through the show, I Googled the show to get some background info. It turns out that the show aired on one of the major broadcast networks in Korea. That explains why the show is (or had to be) 16 episodes long. It feels like a story that could have been 10 to 12 episodes (or even less) was stretched out to fit the 16-episode format, which explains the slow build up and many repeated scenes. Sure, there's enough intrigue and you quickly build empathy for the main character. You get the sense that just about every character knows \"something\" and you're eager to find out. The plot line becomes more and more interesting as the \"mystery\" and the involvement of each character are revealed. However, when everything is revealed, you cannot help but shake your head. It's like waiting in line for 2 hours for a new ride at an amusement park, and when you finally get on the ride, it's only 2 minutes long and is a dud.You have to take a big leap of faith to accept that two highly unusual events can take place in the exact same place on the same night, just minutes apart. Then, the final reveal in the final episode pretty much ruins everything. I won't give away any more details for those who might insist on watching this show anyways.Other annoyances in this show:\nThe acting, especially the main characters, is excellent. However, there are few minor characters whose performances stick out like a sore thumb. Perhaps most audiences would find this bearable.Poor attention to details. There's a scene where A (in a cop car) is trying to discreetly tail B (in a black car). Yes, that's right, A is trying to discreetly tail him in a cop car and stays less than 20 yards behind the black car the whole time. What is ridiculous is that when shown from the perspective of the cop car, the black car is in the #1 lane and cop car is in #2 lane. When the camera cuts away to the black car's perspective, the black car is miraculously in #2 lane and spots the cop car over his left shoulder in #1 lane. This is just one example. There are plenty more.Poor editing. This goes back to the length issue. There are way too many scenes that are unnecessarily long. A scene of a woman crying that could have been impactful with just 30 seconds drags on for nearly 2 minutes. Conversations between some characters become unnecessarily long. Maybe the editor's hands were tied. Who knows.If you're a huge fan of any of the actors\/actresses and must watch the show, sure. For others, with so many shows available on so many different platforms today, I think you'd be better off investing 15 hours elsewhere. If you're still interested in the show, perhaps it might be better to find a reaction channel or one of those channels that offer condensed 1 hour summary.",

Didn't like the script - never a fan when there are children involved and then the child gets used between parents., and didn't like the ending either.Am I the only one that despite the bad things that Noh Yul-seong has done, feel a wee bit of empathy toward him? The fact that his mother was pulling all the puppet strings, controlled him like a cult leader and he followed her every order - even divorcing his first wife who was his love the FL when she was his child's mother and he actually did love her at that time at the order of his mother for business sake? And that, yes, he had an argument with the FL's mother but it was an accidental death not murder? I just liked his acting and didn't like much of anything else about this series.Didn't like the fact that the FL never once took any level of moral culpability for any of the things that she has done. For example, remarry him just for revenge and to dig for information so get him arrested to get custody of her son. Tell him lies the whole time about how she will support him in his business as a wife, blah, blah, and he actually fell for it at first. Also no culpability for indirectly getting witnesses killed perhaps while doing all this revenge and stabbing her clients in the back (her client was the 2nd wife of the CEO whom she got Noh to divorce) only to remarry him. Revenge is not sweet when you hurt people along the way and just didn't like any of it. And then to dismiss the sanctity of marriage at the ending and suggest it should have a 5 year expiration date when you have a child involved?",

This is a comedy about two people rediscovering each other and the relationship that blooms from it. Every episode had me laughing and wanting to watch more.I love Bae Jong Ok! She looks so good in this drama! I loved her in Mr. Queen and Longing For You. To see her in another comedy role is wonderful, she was made for it.This was my first time watching a series with Lee Yoo Young, and I'm not disappointed, she made me laugh and was great in her role.Hang Gi Chan is so cute, I just can't with him. He had a great supporting role and was so comedic in playing it.Overall, this is a cute love story between two people who rediscover each other after several years.

As someone who's watched the first 4 eps (will do w the others) more than 10 times, I can say this is one of my favs. If you say that you didn't enjoy a singular scene after watching the whole show, you're lying to yourself.Very SHORT Summary: Tae Myungha, who is originally 29, is transported into a simulation where he is 19. His one mission is to make Cha Yeowoon happy, but if he fails to do so then he will face death.LIKES:What is there to dislike? This show has brought nothing but surprise to me. Not in a bad way, in a good way. It isn't repetitive like other bls. This one is one of those where you're unsure what is up next. It follows the mains and has you wanting more. It was Thursday (the day eps 3&4 came out) and I didn't want them gone. They're so cute that you just want to put them in your pocket. I even had hoped the weekend would end sooner due to the fact it would be closer to the next episodes.DISLIKES:. . .IN CONCLUSION:You most definitely NEED to watch this if you are debating to. This is one of those shows that hooks you the first episode. Could it be confusing? Yes. But it clicks after the first few eps. Others may disagree but I couldn't ask for a better kbl to start off 2024. This may take the #1 spot with Semantic Error and The Eighth Sense.Who would I be if I didn't add this amazing quote? (From EP 8)\"I finally realized that every answer I had hoped for was in everyday life that's too mundane to be \"fate\", yet too beautiful to be \" chance.\" Happiness must be hidden somewhere in my each of our days. \"Things are bound to happen, whether you want it or not. It may not be determined by a supernatural power, but it wasn't just a possibility. You make it happen with how you continue on in life, and I hope you can reach happiness just like Tae Myungha and Cha Yeowoon, whether it's through love or not.",

But when you factor in the inanity, peurility, and vacousness you get when the three presenters appear to want to intend it for an audience of three year olds, it reaches a new low.The fact is, 'rich' people (most of whom have become wealthy because of some annoying quirk of fate anyway) seldom have anything interesting in their lives. The only thing they offer is their narcissism and self absorption.If that's your thing, knock yourself out.This show is the intellectual equivalent of staring at paint drying.",

Completely annoying and no point... this should be called a reaction video of the super rich in korea. I had to stop watching after 4 minutes into it. If there was a way to mute their nonsense noise making then maybe i would have watched this a bit longer. All they do repeat the scene, \"look at the bag\", \"look at the room\", \"wow\", \"wow\", \"wow\", \"they are going into the room\", \"wow\", \"what?\", \"wow\", \"wow\", \"wow\", \"wow\", \"wow\". You can understand the amount of \"wow\" and the entire 4 minutes into, i am trying to understand why they are even there.. do they need to be there to help explain how rich these people are?

How close they are and that they jive well. The first 2 episodes were like a teaser for us to know how these 2 are when they are together having fun. Adding V to the next episodes gave us an overview of how the Maknae line gets along with each other. Teasing, bickering, and all that. Boys will not be boys without the banters. We also see the dynamics of the boys with each other which is good to see as the episode goes along. Looking forward to the next episodes and finally watching how Jimin and Jungkook adapt and get more comfortable in doing the travel show. Hopefully, they can continue doing the travel show for a long long time.Keep going Jimin & Jungkook!",

Fans of BTS already know that Jimin and Jungkook are incredibly close - so close, in fact, that they enlisted in the military together. Here in this series, viewers get a glimpse of them traveling together before their enlistment began.The show isn't flashy. This is made mostly for ARMY, who enjoy watching members interact.Episodes 1-2 feature Jimin and Jungkook alone. Contrast that with the following three episodes which include fellow band member V.The interactions change a bit when V arrives. It's also entertaining , but in a bit of a different way. V's addition shows a different dynamic. Where Jimin and Jungkook clearly display a very close intimate relationship, V and the other members have a more playful dynamic.Either way, viewers will get a look at the interpersonal relationships among different members of the group. One thing is abundantly clear, however. Jimin and Jungkook are the best of friends and clearly adore one another.

Share their jokes, taste the food they seem to love, visit the places they visit etc. It even gave me inspiration for activities to do during my next travel.But at the end of the day they showed that no matter the situation, as long as we are with the right person, every moment turns into a good memory.",

I hope that this show will continue And they travel around the world together until they are fifty years old. Jikook's chemistry when they are together is so cute and I'm glad they shared some of their unforgettable moments with us. I am proud to be their fan and I love watching their duos. So far, their trip to New York and Jeju Island was full of happy and fun moments and I am impatiently waiting for the broadcast of the episodes related to the trip to Japan To see them skiing and playing in the snow.",

It's Park Jimin and Jeon Jungkook, our Busan boys. Funny banters, endless roleplays, chaotic grocery shopping, endless food trips, or just sitting and staring at the vast ocean. They will take us into their own little world. Funny adventures to misadventures that will make your stomach hurt (no pun intended) from their antics. It's a roller coaster ride. Their bond is like no other.My favorite episode so far: episode 4!!!!A MUST WATCH!!!",

        "body":"Jungkook and Jimin are incredibly talented artists who have worked hard to reach where they are. The show is an opportunity for them to explore new creative outlets beyond their usual music. It's important to respect their creative freedom and the choices they make in their careers. Not everyone has to enjoy the same type of content, but variety shows are an essential part of entertainment culture in Korea. They allow artists to connect with their audience on a more personal level, showing different sides of their personalities. This adds depth to their public personas, making them more relatable. If someone genuinely doesn't like the show, it's more productive to offer constructive criticism rather than simply hating on it. Every show can improve, but blind hate doesn't contribute to making the show better. Creating and hosting a variety show is no easy task. Jungkook and Jimin have taken on this challenge, which shows their dedication to entertaining their fans in diverse ways. Instead of focusing on the negatives, it's worth celebrating their effort and innovation. Many fans find joy and comfort in seeing their favorite idols in different contexts. \"Are You Sure?!\" might be just what some fans need to brighten their day. Criticism should be mindful of the positive impact it has on those who enjoy it. The show might not be for everyone, and that's okay. But the beauty of entertainment is that it offers something for everyone. If \"Are You Sure?!\" isn't your cup of tea, there are plenty of other things to enjoy without resorting to hate.",

This travel vlog was something they had talked about doing ever since they traveled to Tokyo together back in 2017. It becomes the vehicle for the guys to spend time reconnecting and making some memories before they went into the military service. So glad they found the time to do it and it's very enjoyable to watch. Jim and Jungkook always had a natural chemistry and it comes through effortlessly.

They sprinkle in some classic grocery shopping and cooking. They eat lots of good food and do some fun activities, and just have a lot of fun. They've known eachother for over a decade so they're very comfortable together and sometimes don't need to say much to know what the other is thinking.

Fun episodes, with the day-to-day life of a trip, with its unexpected events, jokes and interaction between people who have known each other for a long time.The idea is a light travel itinerary that is good to follow, at times it even feels like going back to adolescence, which is so common when long-time friends meet. Of course, no matter how much they are themselves, there will be moments of shyer interactions after all, it is still a variety show,\nwhere there are many people involved filming. But in many moments when they are alone, they seem to forget that they are being filmed and the games come naturally.

A second individual gets the job. Banaza is unwanted and banished to a particularly dangerous forest. It turns out the authorities were wrong about him and defeating a slime leads to him gaining all skills at an unmeasurably high level! He decides to disguise himself and live an easy life. Of course it won't be too easy. He meets, and defeats Fenrys, a demon-wolf girl who ends up living and developing feelings for him.This might not be deep and meaningful but it is rather fun. Banaza is a likeable protagonist and Fenrys is a cute romantic interest. I liked the fact that even though more girls end up joining Banaza it doesn't feel like an obvious harem story. His power means there is little sense of danger but there is a decent amount of action which is fun to watch. The alternate 'Blond Hero' is an entertaining antagonist. The animation and character designs are good. There is a fair amount of fan service but not an excessive amount. Overall a fun series; I'd recommend it to fans of light hearted isekai.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",

Secondly, the animation, song production, and character performances are clearly above average. But at this point I'm not going to judge the show by the same standards as I would a normal anime, so far it's been great, but I'm hoping for something that touches the audience and my heart even more. Enough said, I can only believe in Hanada (and by the way, the songs are really good!). \/ep 13 Although there was no car crash that I was worried about, but the scribbling of the end is obviously not satisfactory, from the eighth episode onwards the pace of the series is getting faster and faster, if he was willing to make 24 episodes of the series, the narrative rhythm can be captured a lot better than it is now, it's not bad, but it could have been done better.",

His eldest son, Ichiro (Masanobu Ando), is unreliable, does not get along with his wife, has a Ginza hostess as his mistress, and is planning a new luxury restaurant without borrowing funds from his father so that he can leave his father's influence.Yumiko (Kyoko Hasegawa), the firm eldest daughter, has two seemingly happy children with her handsome trading company man husband, but her husband is doing shady deals (of a different kind than an interpreter for famous Major-League players) behind her back.The second son, Ryu (Mackenyu Arata), does not get along with his father, and after studying in the U. S., he returns to Japan to work for a small non-profit organization without contacting his family. One day, Ryu bumps into a beautiful American woman while jogging in the park, and her phone falls into the street and breaks. Ryu promises to pay for it, and when he asks for the woman's contact information, she gives Ryu her business card, which says \"reporter\" on it.Risako (Nakata Seina), the youngest and second daughter, aspires to be a singer-songwriter and is already 25 years old, but she has a natural singing voice and talent for songwriting and is expected to make a major debut. Risako tells her father, Ryutaro, about her dream, but Ryutaro is afraid that Risako will be swallowed up by the darkness of the entertainment world.One night, the son of Takeuchi (Masatoshi Nakamura), a candidate for the next prime minister, is killed after a bar fight. The son was also suspected of being on drugs. The murder suspect is caught, but \"commits suicide\" in jail.Overall, the story has a cool taste and a serious development. A scandal involving a politician, Ichiro's mistress, Yumiko's husband's ruinous dealings, Ryu starting a relationship with a beautiful reporter, Risako going for her dream, and their lives are vividly depicted.Hisako Manda's restrained performance as Ryutaro's wife, Kyoko, shines.The show's portrayal of the Tokyo club (the one with hostesses) scene, with Tae Kimura's performance as a hostess, adds a touch of realism that makes the show feel all the more authentic. Tae Kimura's performance as the hostess Ryutaro values as a source of information has a realistic feel as if she actually works at a club in Tokyo.What sets \"House of the Owl\" apart from other Japanese TV drama series is its serious, captivating depiction of the family's struggles, without resorting to over-the-top acting or exaggerated music. There is none of the over-the-top music, over-the-top acting, or over-the-top (unintelligible) jokes that are common in Japanese dramas, nor are there any male celebrities from famous entertainment companies that have caused scandals in Japan, nor any female casts from dozens of female idol group members performing not-so-good songs and dances.Thus, we can calmly observe the whereabouts of this charismatic, mastermind owl, Ryutaro Oogami, and his family.And just as real owls have natural enemies, those who are after \"owls\" are also heavily represented.If you have watched the episodes carefully, you may be shocked by the series of events that occur in the latter half of the season. The series culminates in a shocking series of events that will leave you eagerly anticipating the next season. This is a must-watch for anyone looking for a drama that offers a glimpse into the complex lives of a family caught up in the world of politics and finance.I can't wait for the second season.",

He's grumpy, keeps to himself, and doesn't get along with his dad, which makes sense since his parents are hardly there.The pacing is off though. Hana and his friends are the same age as Yoh was during the Shaman Fight, but they're already as strong as Yoh was at the very end. It's a shonen so the story revolves around them, but it feels a bit extreme. One character is only 7 years old and supposedly the strongest!The original cast is mostly still around for some reason, but they just let these kids fight a world-ending battle.The story builds on the prequel and continues the Shaman Fight, but it feels a bit unnatural at times. The characters all seem to understand what's happening, but the main character, Hana, is completely left in the dark. It seems like the author forgot to tell her what's going on! This lack of explanation is frustrating, especially since Hana clearly needs some guidance.Some characters, like Tamao, feel forced into their new roles. The way they portray her now is completely different from how she was before. It's hard to believe she would act this way.Because of these issues, I almost gave up on the show halfway through. However, the last few episodes offered a glimmer of hope. Hana finally started to develop as a character, and the plot itself became more interesting. Since I haven't read the manga, I'm unsure if this improvement is temporary. I'll wait for reviews before deciding if I'll watch the next season.",

The Hansel and Gretel, for instance just was not what I was expecting and didn't really make me feel it was even close to being that fairytale. Red riding hood was strange trying to be in the future, but again wasn't really what I was expecting the tales would be. The blood and all that doesn't bother me and was nice they included the \"horror\" aspects which I was expecting from the Gimm stories. I appreciate they were trying to go with something new, but they did a pretty good job in my opinion with Cinderella. Watching that first episode got me excited for the rest.

'Little Red Riding Hood' and 'The Elves and the Shoemaker' had good ideas for the subtext in which they wanted to shift the focus of the story, but they could not implement it very well.

The artwork is lovely, the character designs are whimsical, the Pied Piper episode was stretching into Ghibli-esque territory with their visuals, and some of the themes and elements were downright chilling.First episode sets you up thinking everything will have this subversive twist. The last episode almost does the same thing, but you are more along for the ride on the subversion train rather than blindsided by it.But none of the other episodes reach a satisfying level of \"unexpected,\" instead, leaving you with a feeling of wondering what it was trying to represent. The source fairy tales themselves already had their moral lessons and with rare exception, it didn't present any \"variation\" to the tales or moral lessons.

The first episode was fine, but the others were just weird and missing a moral\/a message of the story. I think it's one of the shows were a lot is metaphoric and up to interpretation, but it's not presented in a fun, clever and interesting way like eg love, death and robots or Star Wars Visions.

Despite some criticism, I believe that sometimes, simple anime can be just as entertaining and engaging as those with more complex storylines.

It's like each fairy tale story was prompted to be mixed with a Sci-fi anthology series and the sound track was sourced from classical composers, though not always in a classical style.And yeah the tones here all over the place while also being similar. It's really best to view each episode as it's own because really the only thing tying them together is the short openings with the Grimm siblings discussing the original fairy tales, and eventually having some small cameo in the story of the episode. So very \" Rod Serling\" or Alfred Hitchcock.As others have said with no spoilers\nCinderella is closest to the source material with a 'dark twist' so I'd say it best matches Night GalleryI found a special fondness for Red Riding Hood which had shades of Hannibal and Black MirrorHansel and Gretel feels more Twilight Zone still a little twisty but nowhere near as dark as either of the previous tales.Elves and the Shoemaker totally lost me I'll be honest, I won't even pretend to understand what happened there but then even the Main Character didn't even get it so maybe that was the point XD.The Town Musicians of Bremen would be right at home as an entry for Love Death & Robots.The Pied Piper Of Hamlin is rather Tales of the Darkside or maybe one of the more mild Master of Horror episodes.",

This series offers captivating reinterpretations of six Grimm Brothers' fairy tales, each presented in distinct genres. But wait a minute. The Grimms didn't write \"The Pied Piper of Hamelin.\" Anyway, in the beginning of each episode, the brothers and Charlotte, their younger sister, appear.In my estimation, the most exceptional segments of the series feature a western science fiction adaptation of \"The Bremen Town Musicians,\" in which the animal protagonists are human females. I agree with the anime fans who have seen the series. CLAMP, the creators of \"Card Captor Sakura\" and \"X\/1999,\" originated the concept art for the series, and I love it.I really enjoy this series because I love fairy tales, though I'm 38 years old, and also because CLAMP's one of my favorite manga artists.

Even if the stories are a bit confusing at times, I feel like I understand them by the end, and I gain something from each one. This series also doesn't just rely on horror or being as messed up as possible. It is more mature, for sure, but I know not every ending is going to be super dark. There are happy, sad, and even horrific endings, and each one is written beautifully. So, I don't feel like it needs to be gory to hold my interest. If you want a new, mature, or interesting take on old fairy tales, you should watch this, because I'm sure at least one of these endings will move you and leave you pondering the world each story takes place in, and how the story continues.",

The animation is low quality for a 2024 anime, the voice acting comes across as if the voice actors hate having to do this show, the story line has zero development and is a test of your patience to sit through and lastly, the entire show is wholeheartdly boring to watch.There isn't really much that could be done to make this show better either because the foundation it is built around is so weak to begin with that there really is nothing to extrapolate meaning from in any of this.Normally, shows like this aren't much of an issue and can be a good watch if the intent behind it is for comedic value but there is zero humour in this show either which makes it feel like this story was written as a genuine, serious story that was never intended to be a spoof\/troll experience. That fact alone makes the anime pretty embarrassing, exceedingly cringy and almost pathetic just by existing as it currently does.Also, as you expect with terribly written anime\/manga stories like these, they tried way too hard to make up for the tragic quality of everything by inserting a boat load of busty teenage school girls for no reason whatsoever. This is the epitome of why anime has a bad repuation for many people.This is one of the worst shows I've ever experienced and is fighting for dead last.

Adapted from the manga of the same name after over 20 years, Sand Land keeps the charm of Toriyama's storytelling ways and gags.Compared to his magnus opus, Dragon Ball, Sand Land keeps to a pretty realistic approach against the previous power-driven action, with witty tactics often proceeding the story instead of the common beat-em-up. This aspect itself shows development in Toriyama as a writer of manga, which needn't require fist-fights and whooping actions all the time to relay the intensity.The Animation was great, especially the emphasis provided towards the subtle movements and nuances of the character movements. The whole of the character animations were pretty much done in 1s (full 24 drawings in a 24 fps Animation format), which gave incredibly smooth movements. 3D elements of the BG mixed with 2D elements were a pleasing new rendition, compared to Toriyama's earlier anime adaptations.Nostalgic references from the Dragon Ball anime series are evident and are often pleasing.Overall, it has been a pleasant watch with the first 7 episodes of the Season.

        "body":"In anticipation for Dragon Ball Daima, I decided to take a look back at the Sand Land animated series I watched last Spring. Which was a pretty rough month for me if I'm being completely honest. I'm a huge Dragon Ball fan and after I heard that Akira Toriyama passed away, this show was just the therapy I needed. I really engaging quest through desert involving demons, mystery, and dynamic action sequences was just what the doctor ordered. It's so simple and yet it has a surprising amount of depth to it. And think it just goes to show how good Toriyama is at character writing.This adventure centers around Sheriff Rao, who has formed an alliance with the demons in order to find the secret oasis of the desert to save both of there homes from the water crisis. Teaming up with the reckless Fiend Prince Beelzebub and his timid caretaker Thief. And later on in the new Forest Land section of the story, Ann from the resistance army. And personally, while I really enjoyed this show, it did feel a bit unbalanced. I thought the Sand Land portion was great and the new Forest Land portion was just good. Not because I didn't like the characters introduced in Forest Land, but rather because they didn't have a ton to do in the climax.I usually compared Ann to Bulma seeing that they both enjoy tinkering with machines and enjoy riding fast moving vehicles. Though the biggest difference is that Bulma was designed to be a supporting character covering Goku's weaknesses using her intelligence and inventing skills to remove obstacles. While Ann could've worked as a main character seeing that she was on a mission to save her family and lived a hard life, though she doesn't do a ton of fighting in the story, that could've benefited from a few more episodes to expand her character. She's not bad, I just wish I got to learn more about her character.With that being said, the story itself is still really good. Albeit a bit similar to OG Dragon Ball, the structure was completely intentional, seeing that Toriyama wanted to return to a storytelling format that would be impossible to include in modern Dragon Ball. Make no mistake, Dragon Ball Z is an amazing series, but it goes for an action focused style of storytelling rather than an energetic adventure like the original series. New worlds were being built, but were explored in a much more tense and dangerous fashion. Dragon Ball hunting was still entertaining, but it could now be pulled off in a day now that the characters possessed the ability to fly at great speeds.And that's where Sand Land comes in. Allowing Toriyama to return to his old favorite storytelling style, where a group of misfits go on an adventure to find a legendary treasure. And having read all of the Dragon Ball manga, it feels incredibly satisfying to return to this format. I brings back so much nostalgia. The characters and setting may be completely different, but the experience feels so fresh and rejuvenating. It's a a great example of taking a somewhat familiar story and adding a handful of unique elements to make it feel like a spring breeze.Over the years I've seen plenty of stories where supposed villains become the good guys and I can usually predict what's going to happen. But at the same time, I still really like that style of storytelling and Toriyama still does a fantastic job humanizing evil looking characters. I won't go into spoilers, but there is a really tragic twist surrounding Rao's character that leads to a ton of great reactions, that made me fall in love of the narrative. Setting the stage for the perfect climax, in the Sand Land portion of the story. Like I said earlier, Forest Land needed to flesh out its new characters a bit longer. That won't stop me from recording this incredible mini series. Definitely go check it out when you have the chance.",

He has a deep sense of justice and will use any means necessary to make sure that Justice is served, like altering evidence or intimidating witnesses, which sometimes makes the viewer question his morals, but it all makes sense in the end.

The first review before mine says it all basically.I admire the Japanese so much for how crazy and funny they can be, like seriously surreal and hilarious. Plus they always add a humanity and morality factor, and there's always a deeper meaning behind even the wackiest scripts.All the actors were really good, especially the least experienced younger ones, the random bursting into song was funny, the cultural references were very accurate universally not just in the Japanese context. There were parts I literally laughed out loud and there were even a couple parts I teared up a bit, which I was really not expecting. All in all, very entertaining!!",

        "body":"This was being heavily promoted on Netflix in Japan when I was there in March 2024. It looked intriguing but never did I expect for it to be such a good show.The time travel premise, the outlandish and amusing characters and random musical numbers all hooked me in the first episode.As the show went on, it had more and more to say about how different the 80's were to the present day for better or for worse, but through the eyes of Ogawa we see a different take on our current world and learn with him as some his views change.We eventually get hit with some major emotional moments that were completely unexpected and add further depth to the show in such a fantastic way, but even after that it doesn't fail to be funny and entertaining.The musical numbers, while some better than others were almost always catchy standouts being, Let's Have A Conversation, Harassment and Daddy's Suit. Of course the opening Nidone by Creepy Nuts which played often through the show was incredible and it became my most played song for that month while travelling Japan.If you're looking for something completely different to watch and want to give something new a chance, this show will surprise you in almost every way and you'll be glad for having watched it.",

It's perhaps a bit too unbelievable that he ends up as an intern at Yuki's workplace - but again, if you accept the premise and view this series as very light-hearted entertainment, it can work.I really enjoyed watching this series and loved the inclusion of Korean language, culture, and since I know some Korean myself, it was fun to hear Tae-Oh's thoughts in Korean - especially when I don't understand a word of Japanese like the other characters speak in the series.There are far too few series out there where the main character falls in love with someone from another culture - there should be more of that, and I think this series is a sweet little contribution to that.",

As well as the whole premise of being telepathic of course.So anyways, the cuteness is exaggerated too, they have literally made the sweetest, cutest, nicest ML to ever have existed in any series, which reminds me of stuff I used to watch when I was a kid, and right now I don't mind it.Bonus points, my two favorite languages in one series!

Y'all CLEARLY need to stay in your Kdrama lane and let those of us who can enjoy an expansive world of dramas live and enjoy things! The main female lead, Yuri, wasn't acting any more abnormal than what plenty of actresses do in a really soapy soap opera in virtually any country. I'm no expert in Japanese acting styles, but her character can be compared to an anime character especially if you've seen any Romance or Romantic Comedy anime, the female leads frequently are portrayed like how this actress is portraying her character. Tae Oh, the male lead, is probably gonna go down as one of my favorite bfs ever, please he was adorable I'm in love! I don't understand the criticism of him, his character was well rounded, had a beautiful background story related to his mom, and had so many sides of him that were great on top of being a doting sweetie. The only thing I will admit is that Yuri is the kind of character you fall in love with by the end of the series as oppose to right from jump. After seeing her unconditional love for her father, her passion for her work and the environment, her friendships, and her love story you can't help but fall for her. This is a heartwarming, beautiful, funny slice-of-life show with a bit of mystery that makes it much more exciting. It's UNIQUE and not following a formula, you will love it if you appreciate creativity and a bit of whimsy.",

A mildly interesting back-story.But then episode 4 comes along, and you can start to see it....that failing of every less than stellar writer out there: The typical \"Let's make the entire plot revolve around miscommunications, misperceptions, or total lack of reason.\" But episode 4 ends kind of meh....maybe OK.But the transition into episode 5, which makes zero sense considering episode 4, brings all the typical tropes to the forefront. The lead, who is quirky, cute, and unsure, rapidly becomes unlikeable and annoying in her behaviors. And the writers don't help any by making the motivations behind every scene she is in justify a completely different outcome, or at least a completely different response from her.Her actions become completely random and unfathomable that you stop caring, simply because you know she is going to say, act, or do something stupid.I know it is only 5 episodes in, but if this show continues to revolve around using these cheap overused tricks to generate any sort of conflict (where any sane person wouldn't have any) then this show isn't going to get any better. And note that I said \"sane\". Sure, she has an ability that others don't know she has. But it does NOT justify her actions, and hence it becomes clear she has a serious psychological issue as well. And her traumatic back story can't, or hasn't, justified it one bit.Again, lazy writers using lazy inconceivable interpersonal responses simply to move the plot\/conflict along is just painful to watch.",

Watch it NOW!Story focuses on two 15 year old students, the bewildered and totally oblivious Nishikata, and his nemesis Tagaki, who delightfully and successfully win the teasing battle between the two. She obviously adores Nishikata (as do all his fellow students), but all in an effort to spend time with him. Nishikata, on the other hand, is obsessed with beating her in their teasing game, to the point his scheming, and over confidence, betrays his inherent innocence. It's all in good fun, or rather in Tagaki's efforts to get Nishikata to like her!Over the course of the 10 episodes, our Nishikata starts to recognize he has some weird feelings for Tagaki, but never quite puts the pieces together. When Tagaki's father is set to be transferred, and move to Paris, Nishikata's competitive instincts start to be clouded by Tagaki moving away. The last three episodes are sublime...so very funny, awkward, and endearing.The episodes are about 25 minutes long, move quickly and are in sync. The leads, both Nishikata and Tagaki are wonderful.

This show however stays firmly grounded in the human realm with no hint of supernaturality (I made that word up). It seems rushed at times, it is only 8 episodes and forced them to jump around and skip over what would've been fascinating fights to see (KODOKU was only 2 episodes!?. Kengan Ashura has spent its entire show on its illegal underground tournament...). The fights also could've and should've been varied more, with differents styles and moves, many fights weren't all that different from each other?

        "body":"I recently stumbled upon \"Garouden: The Way of the Lone Wolf\" on Netflix and found it to be an exceptional experience. Despite its low reviews on IMDb, I believe this anime is a hidden gem that deserves more appreciation. Here's why:**Storyline:**\n\"Garouden: The Way of the Lone Wolf\" follows the journey of a lone martial artist navigating through a world of intense and brutal underground fighting. The story is gripping, filled with suspense, and showcases the protagonist's relentless pursuit of strength and mastery. Each episode kept me on the edge of my seat, eagerly anticipating the next challenge and the growth of the characters.**Characters:**\nThe character development in this anime is commendable. The protagonist is not just a typical fighter; he is complex, with a deep backstory that gradually unfolds. The supporting characters are also well-crafted, each adding depth and diversity to the narrative. Their interactions and conflicts enrich the story, making it more engaging and emotionally resonant.**Realistic Fighting:**\nOne of the standout aspects of this anime is its dedication to realism. There are no superpowers, magic, fireballs, angels, or demons. The fighting is raw and authentic, allowing viewers to feel every hit. This grounded approach is particularly captivating, providing a refreshing break from the more fantastical elements common in other anime. The final knee kick by Juzo Fujimaki, in particular, is a highlight that exemplifies the sheer intensity and realism of the combat scenes.**Animation and Art Style:**\nThe animation quality is top-notch, with fluid fight sequences that are both visually stunning and realistic. The art style perfectly complements the gritty and raw nature of the underground fighting world. The attention to detail in the character designs and fight choreography is particularly impressive, making each battle a visual treat.**Soundtrack:**\nThe soundtrack enhances the overall atmosphere of the anime. The intense and adrenaline-pumping music perfectly matches the high-stakes fights, while the more subdued tracks add emotional depth to the quieter, more reflective moments. The voice acting is also superb, with each actor bringing their character to life convincingly.**Themes:**\n\"Garouden: The Way of the Lone Wolf\" explores themes of perseverance, the pursuit of excellence, and the complexity of human nature. It delves into the psychological aspects of martial arts, the sacrifices made for greatness, and the personal demons each character faces. These themes add layers of meaning to the action-packed narrative.**Conclusion:**\nIn conclusion, \"Garouden: The Way of the Lone Wolf\" is an underrated masterpiece that deserves more recognition. It combines a compelling storyline, well-developed characters, stunning animation, and a powerful soundtrack to create an unforgettable viewing experience. While it may not appeal to everyone, especially those who prefer lighter or more mainstream anime, it is a must-watch for fans of intense, character-driven stories and martial arts.Give it a chance, and you might find yourself as captivated by it as I was. This anime has earned a solid 9 out of 10 in my book, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a deep and thrilling anime experience.",

        "body":"\"The Way of the Lone Wolf\" anime series has garnered mixed reactions from viewers, and I find myself sharing a similar sentiment. One of the most compelling elements of the series is its grounding in reality. Unlike many other anime that delve into fantastical realms and supernatural occurrences, \"The Way of the Lone Wolf\" offers a more realistic portrayal of its characters and their struggles. This sense of realism helps to create a connection between the audience and the characters, making their journeys more relatable and impactful.The series' strength lies in its ability to depict the protagonist's journey in a manner that feels authentic. The challenges faced by the protagonist, from personal dilemmas to social conflicts, are presented in a way that resonates with the viewers. This realism extends to the depiction of the world within the series, where the settings and situations are crafted to mirror our own reality. This grounding in reality is a refreshing change of pace, offering a break from the often over-the-top narratives found in other anime.However, despite its strong foundation, \"The Way of the Lone Wolf\" falls short in several key areas, particularly in its storytelling. The narrative, while competent, is undeniably generic. It follows a familiar path, with predictable twists and turns that fail to surprise or engage the audience on a deeper level. The lack of originality in the storytelling is a significant drawback, as it prevents the series from standing out in an oversaturated market.The ending, in particular, was a major disappointment. It felt rushed and lacked the emotional payoff that the build-up promised. A more thought-out and satisfying conclusion could have elevated the series significantly. Instead, the ending left many viewers feeling unfulfilled, as if the journey had not been worth the investment of time and emotion. This weak conclusion undermines the entire narrative, leaving a bitter taste in the mouth of the audience.One of the most glaring issues with \"The Way of the Lone Wolf\" is the lack of depth in its protagonist. While the series attempts to create a complex character, it falls short of fully developing him. The protagonist's motivations and inner struggles are only superficially explored, making it difficult for the audience to truly connect with him. A more nuanced and layered portrayal of the protagonist could have added much-needed depth to the series.To improve the storytelling and overall impact of the series, the creators should consider several key changes. Firstly, adding more depth to the protagonist is crucial. Exploring his backstory, motivations, and inner conflicts in greater detail would make him a more compelling character. This would not only enhance the audience's connection to him but also add layers to the narrative, making it more engaging.Additionally, the series would benefit from a more original and unpredictable plot. Introducing unique twists and turns that deviate from the conventional narrative would keep the audience on their toes and make the series more memorable. It's important for the creators to take risks and push the boundaries of the genre to create a standout story.Furthermore, a more satisfying and well-paced conclusion is essential. The ending should feel like a natural and rewarding culmination of the protagonist's journey, providing closure and emotional resonance. This would leave the audience with a lasting impression and a sense of fulfillment.In conclusion, while \"The Way of the Lone Wolf\" has a strong foundation in its realistic portrayal of characters and settings, it falls short in its generic storytelling and underdeveloped protagonist. By adding depth to the main character, introducing more original plot elements, and crafting a more satisfying ending, the series could reach its full potential and leave a lasting impact on its audience.",

Opening is of the anime is just a headache, putting lame art doesnt make opening good.There is no depth in the story, fight scenes are also very repetitive and not properly done. Anime in 2001 were better than this.A well-structured plot with engaging twists and memorable moments is essential.Characters should be multi-dimensional and relatable, with clear motivations and growth throughout the series.High-quality animation with attention to detail, fluid movements, and appealing art style enhances the viewing experience.",

Katagari seems lost and lonely and falls to the seduction of his married next door neighbor Shino. His female classmate who also has feelings for Katagari finds out and gets mad. Later Katagari confesses his misdeed to Sa Chan and then cuts off Shino. By that time it's too late as Shino's husband has been watching the whole thing on his computer and Sa Chan breaks up with Katagari. Just when Katagari thought that maybe his troubles would be over Shino's husband blackmails him into paying 1 million yen for the transression. He made him pay it over 4 years to torture him. In the end a little girl approaches him and introduces herself as Na Chan. Little does Katagari know that she is the daughter of Shino as he just moved into the same condo building as her. Makes you wonder why Shino name her daughter that . Could he be the love child of Katagari? The other thing that bothered me was when they had the intimate scenes it looks like it wasn't a problem when it was shino and Katagari but when it was Sa Chan you only saw her back. Was she an underage actress? I would like to know if that was the case they should have casted someone else that was age appropriate for the role.",

I assumed what he immediately gets himself involved in is a honey trap extortion scheme. Maybe I was wrong but maybe I was actually \"half\" right? I'll never really know. Maybe I'm dumb, but It's all so unclear, and the dialogue is so formal and stilted that I found the whole business inscrutable. But I kept watching for the wtf? Factor and to see if there'd be some shocking plot twist. Whether there is, I won't say. (No spoiler zone.) I've watched a lot of Japanese TV series on Netflix (at least 25 or so) but never have I encountered one with such a clueless and unlikeable protagonist. And with the finale implying that something extremely disturbing is about to go down, he just goes from bad to worse. But then maybe this series represents some kind of Japanese neo-existentialism, and I'm just not intellectual enough to appreciate how \"deep\" it is. Whatever. Not gonna lie, the only \"deepness\" I ever sensed is the overwrought opening sequence with the hapless Sa-Chan submerged in dark water and struggling for air. (btw, that underwater scene is jarring and over-used for its cheap shock effect.) Any stars I'm giving all go to the actress who plays the alluring Shino.

The star has really struck me as working gracefully with minimalist gestures and movements to mesmerize us - the simplicity of what she does belies the power she has. Much of the humour exacted is from the context of the very competitive office life - now shadowed by the off the beaten track z generation. Hoodies versus suits. I have witnessed first hand the working practices and the business environment which this series deftly satirizes. Of course like many series these days it has its origin in manga series.

Some years later we had \"Doctor X\" and the headstrong lead played by Yonekura Ryoko.Like Arai Nanao, all three actresses are or had been models who later transitioned into acting. I don't know much about Ms Arai, but I do think both Esumi and Yonekura had or have acting talents. I hope the same is true for Nanao.But that remains to be seen. My disappointment is that this series may not be the right vehicle or opportunity for her to do so. The obvious difference is that one of the two leads whom she plays seems to be on the autism spectrum.No idea if this is really so or not.In any case, the series gets a minus two points for being formulaic and recycling decades-old troupes about portraying Japanese men and women in the workplace.

It is a famous nightlife spot in Tokyo and the plot of a small and quite insignificant hospital treating an assortment of accident victims, attempted suicides and the like is unique.The main question I'd love to be answered is why on earth do the characters try to speak so much English? I know that the main character is supposed to be American\/Japanese but her English pronunciation (and everyone else's in the show) is absolutely appalling. An instant improvement would have been if they had just spoken Japanese. Maybe someone out there can suggest a reason why such bad English would be okay to publish.Anyway, the stories are fine, the acting a little over the top at times but overall it's a fun watch.

And warning, if you haven't been exposed to the bizarre disconnect of Japanese sexual mores you may find the show cringe or ridiculous. But the more time you've spent laughing down the rabbit hole of Japanese TV on Netflix, the funnier this series will be. Lots of inside jokes that had a newbie-to-Japanese-comedy friend of mine going \"Huh?! What in the heck does THAT mean?\" An example: 5 minutes into Episode 4, I burst out laughing at \"The only Japanese person allowed to mix English with the Okayama dialect is Fujii Kaze.\" (Which as fan of \"Shinunoga E-Wa\" Kaze, I found hilarious, but my friend just couldn't get it.) The episodes paint a choppy landscape punctuated by noodle slurping morphing into gory ER emergencies, social workers moonlighting as wicked dominatrixes, and ritual bowing concealing bigotry and backstabbing. On the flip side, here's a foodie way to describe \"Shinjuku Yasen Byoin\": Throw an old episode of \"MASH\" plus episodes of \"Dr. X\", \"Saitama Host Club\" and the entire 2024 season of \"Completely Inappropriate\" into an AI blender. Then press Pulse. Add a hit of wasabi powder and \"Shinjuku Field Hospital\" is the smoothie your bot-blender has whipped up for you. As some have mentioned, it makes no sense that the American surgeon's English is worse than Shohei Ohtani's, but OK, whatever. Details, details! LOL.

But since the kids have lived a sheltered life, they often stumble into trouble.While it's unmistakably Star Wars, Skeleton Crew feels like an 80s kids' adventure movie-think The Goonies-but set in space. For long-time fans, it's packed with nostalgic touches, from the gear and spaceships to the alien creatures, all reminiscent of the original trilogy. Hardcore fans will also love the many Easter eggs sprinkled throughout, which bring back fond memories of the franchise's early days.I especially appreciated seeing younger versions of various alien species we know from past films. It makes the galaxy feel more connected, showing that some alien races are a constant presence rather than one-off appearances. There are also fun cameos, like a brief glimpse of a boy who looks like a young Kylo Ren. These little details keep you hooked and eager to spot more.Jude Law, the biggest star in the cast, doesn't appear until the end of the second episode, so it's hard to judge the overall acting quality early on. The young actors, though less experienced, do a decent job. Two of the main kids stand out, reminding me of performances in classics like The Goonies or Stand by Me. One of the four kids is a non-human alien, which makes it tricky to evaluate their acting, and another wears a cybernetic visor that hides much of their facial expression, bringing to mind Geordi La Forge from Star Trek.The production quality is top-notch, with Disney's budget clearly on display. The special effects are flawless, leaving nothing to criticize. However, the episodes are quite short, and the long end credits-over five minutes-feel excessive. With only eight episodes in the season, I worry the story might not progress much unless the pace picks up significantly.Despite these concerns, Skeleton Crew has been a pleasant surprise. It's fun, nostalgic, and engaging for viewers of all ages. I'm excited to see where the story goes and glad that it offers something even for adult fans of the Star Wars universe.",

This show is different from both of those shows but so far it is great. I am enjoying the 80s feel with some cool and fun easter eggs such as the Holiday Special. I also find the kid actors to be pretty good when compared to the actors that were in the Phantom Menace. The only aspect of the show that I am concerned about is the run time, which seems to have plagued many modern shows.

This is a much different take on a story existing in the Star Wars universe. I enjoyed the look and feel of what a suburban town looks like in this world because we have never really seen that. The town they come from reminded me more of the neighborhood from E. T. then anything we had seen recently in shows. The 4 main characters are typical but enjoyable, they each have their clearly defined roles in the group and are acted well by the actors. The pirate vibe isn't necessarily something we have seen played out before and adds a slightly spooky element and an atmosphere of danger. If this was a movie from the 80s it would have fit right in. Enjoying it so far for the new story telling elements in the Star Wars universe, the hints of nostalgia of movies of my childhood, and the fact I can share this Star Wars experience with my kids.

As soon as you can't really lose yourself in the universe, you've warmed up to it, it's already over. Incredibly unsatisfying! I'm probably not going to watch it for months and try to avoid all spoilers so that I can see the whole thing next year. As for the actors: my God, they're children. It's clear that they didn't have years of acting training. Nevertheless, the protagonists are likeable, the music fits and the action isn't too child-friendly.

Perhaps they have more love of that however, than the star wars setting, which seems almost irrelevant.Stranger Things by comparison has a more ultimately mature tone, and is popular with adults moreso than actual kids. I can't help but wonder if millenial writers these days are falling out of touch with what very young gen z, and very old gen alpha might want - with gen z watching shows like 'Invincible', 'Loki', 'Rick and Morty' + 'Wednesday' for eg as well as a lot of animated shows.I'm not sure Star Wars has ever particularly weighted for these generations, let alone a kids on bikes trope kind of 80s nostalgia than millenials lapped up (and if anything gen z seems more like a 90s nostalgia generation)I digress a lot!

A funny kids family thing? A space pirate journey? Some crucial but never before shown part of Star Wars main lore?

It's written absolutely fine and there is no reason to start picking the details, because it solid and cute entertainment.Just let the people have fun with it, because that is what this show is made for.I am looking forward to see the Jedi using the force with the kids whose are amazed by all the bedtime stories they heard about the jedis and the history of the galaxy around them, which obviously haven't been told on their (hidden) planet.",

It's a pretty put-together Star Wars kids' show with a little bit here and there for adults.I thought the kids' acting was great, the pacing was spot on. It's got a good story that makes you want to know more. So far it has a fun plot about four kids going on an adventure, escaping pirates and potentially solving a mystery about their planet.I can't wait to see where it goes from here, and I'd definitely recommend giving it a shot if you're a Star Wars fan!",

The show captures the spirit of '80s classics like The Goonies, focusing on a group of kids navigating a galaxy fraught with danger, their innocence heightening the stakes. Jude Law's enigmatic character adds depth, guiding the young heroes through challenges that echo the vibrant, dangerous corners of Star Wars lore.While its strengths lie in its rich world-building and heartfelt storytelling, the opening setup-set in a suburban environment eerily reminiscent of Earth-feels out of place and misses the otherworldly charm of iconic Star Wars locales like Tatooine. Nonetheless, Skeleton Crew successfully balances nostalgia with originality, avoiding the pitfalls of Boba Fett and crafting a story that promises both thrills and heart.",

I'll give it this, it's better than Battle for Endor and Caravan of Courage, but not by much from a storyline perspective.Admittedly, I'm not the show's target demographic. It has many things kids like in a show: bright colors, pirates, cute toys I mean characters, and kids cutting school and ignoring parents to go on dangerous, stupid adventures that would unalive them every few minutes. The child acting is relatively decent (much better than what we saw in Phantom Menace) and the costumes seem real enough in most cases, though you can see in other cases where they tried a bit too hard.What the show lacks is most things a Star Wars fan over the age of 12 would enjoy, like decent writing, a coherent set of circumstances, and a connection whatsoever to Star Ways beyond the title and a previously unknown space wizard. The adults are poorly written, acting in ways that make you wonder if helf their poorly-raised children fall in a sarlacc pit and this show is about the ones who survive.Even in a universe centered on magic space cop monks wielding laser swords and moving things with their minds, this show is highly implausable and silly.. but hey, it's not for me.

        "body":"The first two episodes of Star Wars: Skeleton Crew are a real treat. They brought me back to the adventurous, nostalgic vibes of The Goonies, which is a legendary classic. The storyline so far feels fresh yet familiar, capturing that mix of youthful curiosity and thrilling mystery that made The Goonies so special. It's great to see a Star Wars series exploring this kind of narrative-a grounded, character-driven adventure within a galaxy far, far away.The show does a fantastic job of balancing the vast, epic scale of the Star Wars universe with the more intimate, personal journey of its young characters. It's refreshing to see the franchise experimenting with a smaller, more focused story that still retains the sense of wonder and discovery fans have come to love. The first two episodes effectively establish the tone, combining the franchise's iconic visual style with an exciting, kid-centered narrative.The characters are engaging, and the dynamics among the group feel authentic. Each child brings a unique personality to the team, which helps create a sense of balance and diversity in their interactions. Watching them navigate the challenges of being lost in the galaxy while relying on each other for survival is both thrilling and heartwarming. It's reminiscent of the ragtag spirit of The Goonies, but with the added flair of the Star Wars universe, where every corner hides strange creatures, droids, and unexpected dangers.That being said, one aspect stood out to me as slightly off-putting: Ravi Cabot-Conyers' performance. Don't get me wrong, he's talented and clearly has great energy, but his acting feels overdone compared to the rest of the cast. It comes across as exaggerated, almost as if he's trying too hard to sell his character's personality. While I completely understand that these are kids-likely early in their acting careers-and that some level of expressiveness is expected in family-oriented shows, toning it down just a notch would make a big difference. Other young actors in the series seem to find a more natural rhythm, which makes Ravi's performance stand out in a way that sometimes distracts from the overall flow of the scenes.Despite this minor issue, Skeleton Crew has a lot of promise. The setting, pacing, and plot all contribute to a sense of adventure that pulls you in from the start. It's the kind of series that makes you want to binge-watch to see where the story goes next. The blend of suspense, humor, and heart works well, and I can see this appealing to audiences of all ages. Whether you're looking for a bit of Star Wars nostalgia or a fun new show to watch with younger family members, Skeleton Crew seems to hit the mark.One of the standout elements for me is how the show balances lightheartedness with a sense of danger and discovery. It never feels too dark or heavy for its target audience, but it also doesn't shy away from creating genuinely tense and exciting moments. This balance is crucial for a show like this, and it's something the creators have managed quite well so far. The series fits comfortably within the broader Star Wars universe while carving out its own identity.If the performances continue to grow and the story maintains its momentum, I think Star Wars: Skeleton Crew could become a standout hit for the franchise. It's clear that a lot of effort went into crafting a series that captures the essence of classic adventure stories while catering to today's audiences. The comparisons to The Goonies are inevitable, but this show has the potential to carve out its own legacy within the Star Wars canon.In conclusion, the first two episodes of Skeleton Crew are highly enjoyable and worth watching. They deliver a strong start with plenty of excitement and charm. While Ravi Cabot-Conyers' performance might need a little refinement to match the tone of the other actors, this is a minor flaw in an otherwise promising series. If you're a fan of adventurous, character-driven stories with a good mix of humor and suspense, set against the backdrop of the Star Wars galaxy, I'd definitely recommend giving this show a chance.",

        "body":"It's rare nowadays that a Star Wars show or movie gets me or many other fans excited to watch it, and originally, this show was no different. I expected horrible child actors, a story that isn't being taken seriously and which panders new audiences, dotted with horrible writing and a bland story.Instead, I got pleasantly surprised. Skeleton Crew is a somewhat whimsical show about 4 kids getting into a lot of trouble, but it is presented in such a way that it never gets boring or overbearing. The childlike antics drive a strong and interesting plot, and an air of wonder fills every second of the show, one that is reminiscent of early 2000s pirate IPs aimed at kids. The cast is fun, the actors play their roles well (well enough for kid actors), and even the plushie-selling alien of the team has enough personality and comedic presence to elicit a chuckle without making me roll my eyes the way Grogu did in the Mandalorian.Only 2 episodes are out at the time of writing, but as a grumpy old fan who has heavily critiqued every Star Wars show since the first season of Mandalorian, with the exception of the fantastic Andor, I can wholeheartedly recommend these first two episodes.This show is proof that a well-written, funny and interesting show lies at the heart of every success, and that the problem isn't necessarily with the Star Wars audience, but with the earlier shows from Disney just being plain bad\/stupid. I hope the show will succeed to bring in the numbers and show some people at Disney what they really need to do if they want people to care about Star Wars in the coming years.",

We'll take the angle of kids to look into the concept, while making it interesting via elements from The Treasure Island with a visual touch of Pirates of the Carribean. Think of how Super 8 worked - a Spielberg-ish childhood fantasty!\"So much effort, so many visual details and trivia, yet, you can get bored along the way. Because Star Wars stuff is no longer being \"created\". It's simply being \"generated\" the way AI generates images. I'll be glad if this one manages to attract today's kids into the original Star Wars stories but if the question at hand is whether adults would be on board this pirate ship, not so sure here.The Mandalorian rocks as the unique SW series that had gravitas of sort, leaning more towards Sergio Leone westerns than to cheaper space operas. The Acolyte was a betrayal to SW at the very least. Skeleton Crew is, well, neither so bright nor so demented. I don't feel like glorifying or trashing it.But I do have some resentment with Disney's treatment of SW... They never even tried to respect and explore the essence of the concept... Rather, they turned it into a \"setting\" for whatever series they felt like doing. It was wrong. SW is, in and of itself, a dynamic network of valuable ideas and stories to communicate. What Disney+ had been doing is to utilise it with external agendas, concerns and pushes.Anyways... Unlike The Acolyte, Skeleton Crew is at the very least not toxic - so far. (And I'm waiting for the great explanation to why a Jedi would need to wait for some kids to be thrown in his jail cell in order to perform his most simple trick and make the key come to him!)",

I don't know if anyone bothered to tell them, but Star Wars was always written for children. I didn't think you could dumb it down anymore than they already have.

Some aspects are really engaging, while others are a bit predictable or drag at times. The acting is decent, and the pacing is alright, though it could use more depth in some areas. Overall, I wouldn't rate it a perfect 10, but it definitely deserves more nuance than what I've been seeing in these reviews. It's a watchable show with potential that might get better as it goes.

        "body":"Coleman Domingo is great in this. I love John Ortiz in anything, so this was added to my list before it came out.I like the character of Muncie Daniels and the first scenes of his work and personal life are interesting. He makes his way up to to an isolated cabin in the Poconos and runs into a white man in a truck who tells him to come by if he needs anything.I also love how pretty this is. I have found a lot is to be desired when it comes to how things look. Movies and tv on several streaming networks are frequently so ugly I can't watch them. A return to cinematic form is needed and this one gets there many times. The scenes in the Poconos are reason enough to watch. The director and the cinematographer created something VISUALLY watchable. On set locations are awesome. Cheers to the location scout as well.After the scenes in the Poconos is when you need a bit of time to get over some hurdles. The suspension of disbelief will at times elude you. Not because I don't believe white people can be as horrid as they are portrayed here, they can. But some of the portrayals felt cartoonish instead of believably sinister. I did like the thematic elements of social unease though. It is effective and point is taken.However, I don't understand anyone who would go to a stranger's cabin in the middle of the woods, even if they said you could. I wouldn't do that ever. Especially if I was alone. Which I wouldn't be. Hanging in a forest by myself sounds nice, but nope. There would at least be a large dog present, preferably former military.But this guy? Granted he's at least a foot taller than I am, has martial arts experience and is a runner. He's in great shape and probably doesn't feel vulnerable in the same ways a woman under 5'5\" would feel, but again this is Pennsylvania Poconos and maybe you should if you're anyone but a cis white dude.Anyhow, someone is murdered, Muncie is framed and the people who did it are coming after him and his family in a big way. His lawyer, played by Deon Cole advises him to leave the country with his family until it's sorted out. But Muncie doesn't do that because the show would be over. However, this makes a lot of sense. Leave I kept saying to the character. I would. But again, we have established my very developed sense of risk aversion.The best thing about this show are the performances. Everyone here is really keeping this show together in a big way. I think all the people involved are talented and warrant more projects to hone their craft, because this has a lot going for it, even though it did unravel a bit a times. Making a film or tv show is an immense project. This art form is intensely collaborative and hard to accomplish and the film makers should be congratulated for the entertaining premise and the social commentary.",

I enjoyed the message especially living in this extremely polarizing climate. I would like a 2nd season if they can improve on the writing\/plot but if this is truly just a limited series then I think they missed the mark and that's why I gave it a 7.

        "body":"Ignore the poor reviews. It's a solid gripping, fast-paced thriller that keeps you guessing from start to finish. It's rare to see a show pack this much intensity into just a few episodes, but this one pulls it off with flair.The pacing is relentless, with each episode leaving you on edge, eagerly queuing up the next. While the plot twists are sometimes predictable, they're executed with enough style and tension to remain satisfying.The cast deserves high praise. The lead actor, in particular, delivers a standout performance-his portrayal of desperation, paranoia, and determination is both believable and compelling. Supporting characters are well fleshed out, each contributing to the story's layered complexity. However, I felt a few of the villains were a little one-dimensional, which slightly detracted from the narrative's depth.Visually, the series is a treat. The cinematography perfectly captures the gritty, high-stakes atmosphere of the protagonist's journey. Chase scenes are shot with an almost claustrophobic intensity, immersing you in the action. The musical score is another highlight, amplifying the tension without being overbearing.Where The Madness falters is in its occasional reliance on clichés-certain moments felt too familiar for seasoned thriller fans. Additionally, the ending, while satisfying, left a few threads dangling that I wish had been resolved.Overall, The Madness is a binge-worthy series with strong performances, a taut plot, and excellent production value. It's not perfect, but it's a thrilling ride that's well worth your time. For fans of fast-paced mysteries, it's a no-brainer.A solid 8\/10.",

It was like all the right ingredients for a 5-star meal were there, but the chef ran out of time and just tossed everything together and served it up.

The direction and cinematography also enhance the gripping atmosphere.If you're into conspiracy stories or character-driven suspense, I'd say it's worth a shot. I'll see how it plays out, but for now, it gets a thumbs-up from me!",

It's all over the place with 0 energy, thrill, or action. Had an FBI agent telling the main character \"I'm scared, I have a family, but here's some info on the bad guy, why don't you go try being a detective and solving it....

Colman Domingo absolutely nails his role as Muncie Daniels, a media pundit whose life takes a wild turn after he stumbles upon a murder in the woods. From there, it's a chaotic fight to protect his name and survive, all while dealing with estranged family members, dangerous enemies, and the weight of growing isolation.Directed by Clement Virgo, the series is packed with tension and an eerie vibe that's so reminiscent of The Conversation (1974). Domingo's performance is captivating, making you feel every bit of his character's unraveling. With stunning cinematography, a perfectly paced storyline, and layers of suspense, this eight-episode show keeps you hooked all the way through.If you're into psychological thrillers, The Madness is an absolute gem-full of stellar acting, gripping suspense, and an intense look at trust and survival in a dangerous world.",

This misstep detracts heavily from any chance of the story being compelling. The rest of the cast doesn't fare much better, as they too seem to struggle with uninspired dialogue and lackluster direction.Editing choices do little to add any rhythm or momentum to the movie, and the writing feels pedestrian at best, offering no surprises or moments of genuine intrigue.

I especially appreciated the nuanced relationship between the protagonist and the wife of the slain white nationalist leader. Despite their opposing political beliefs, they recognize their mutual dependence for survival, showcasing a compelling dynamic.At first, I expected a typical story about someone wrongfully accused of a crime, but this show is so much more than that. It's layered with tension, moral dilemmas, and unpredictable moments that keep you hooked. My only critique is the inclusion of the Kraints character, who felt somewhat unnecessary to the storyline. Additionally, I wish there was more backstory about the existing relationships and connections prior to the murder, as it would have enriched the narrative.

Then it just dragged for the following 7 episodes which could have been just 3 more. The characters and setting became less and less believable, the backstories fell flat, lots of inconsistencies and unnecessary embellishments.It was simply boring and uninteresting after the first episode. The main character couldn't seem to decide on a personality, many dead ends and superfluous plot details, characters that could have been good but just weren't, and the ending was trash.Would not recommend bothering with this one. If it were 4 episodes, maybe. But even then, it still wouldn't be anything to write home about.",

The comedy is heightened, at times verging on full on satire. The lead character, the English teacher, is gay, so of course there's going to be some focus on lgbt+ issues with him and in the high school itself. But the show enjoys making light of both extremes in our polarized society, left and right. If lgbt+ is all it takes for you to not want to give this, or any show a shot, then I suppose it's not for you. And by that same token, good luck in life if that's all it takes. But for others, I hope you'll give it a try, especially the second episode. The episode seems to be playing out somewhat like a feel good cliché movie, and then there's a hilarious reveal.Also, somebody commented that they thought this was going to be a wholesome workplace comedy. First off it's on FX. Do you not know what their brand is? And it's a TV MA show. Do your homework. Silly criticism. It's FX - which tends to mean it's daring and groundbreaking in some way.

The high schoolers saying they feel targeted, bullied, and triggered while exchanging insults is spot on. The teachers are obvious caricatures of very familiar teacher stereotypes. The only thing not believable is how small the football stadium is at a high school in Texas, and the students look like they're in their early 20s.

Like using his ex as a rebound, or being rude to the other gay teacher because he's afraid they'll date and he'd get fired, or taking it as a personal attack that stupid teen drama doesn't make sense to him.

Playing a gay English teacher at an Austin, Texas high school, Alvarez's Evan Marquez is just out of a relationship with a fellow teacher whom he once kissed in front of students. In the pilot, the mother of one of the kids is trying to get Evan fired for \"turning her son gay\". It's a ridiculous argument, of course (and we never meet the mom in question), but these type of news items in real-life *are* exasperating and ridiculous, so the situation never feels too silly. In the second episode, \"Powderpuff\", Evan is asked by the football team to help them with their drag performance while cheerleaders take the field as players. It's over-the-top TV for Evan to bring in a seasoned drag performer to help the boys (and for the guys to respond), and equally preposterous for said drag queen to turn out to be a thief, but the side-plot with the football coach (Sean Patton) getting schooled on girl's self-defense by teacher Gwen Sanders (Stephanie Koenig, who wrote this installment) is very funny. In the third episode, Evan is partnered on the decorating committee for Homecoming with a new teacher whom Evan feels is gay and hot for him (and this after he's been ordered not to date any more co-workers). The subplot about a student pretending to have a made-up disease doesn't really come off--the kids are really unappealing in this episode--and the start-and-stop flirting between Evan and the horse-hung new teacher hits an early wall. Still, this is a very fresh, bright new show and the humor here--witty, very dry, quick and offhand--is delivered expertly by Alvarez and his cast.",

There's some decent gags and the dialogue is pretty snappy.I think what lets English Teacher down is the thin characters and script. Most of the characters are one note that offer very little other than to placate the plot or the needs of the main character. I think the show focuses all its story and humour through the single lens of Alvarez' own experience as a gay millennial navigating life in the south. As someone who really enjoys Alvarez' comedy, having discovered him and the show through his sketch and musical comedy, I feel he that, with this character and story, he doesn't do himself justice in terms of his comedic range. This also hurts the supporting cast, who aren't fleshed out and act as mere stereotypes most of the time.Generally, English teacher plays it a bit safe. Given it's only the first season, I hope it gets more chances to improve. I think the basics of a good show are present, but the writers need to embrace some irreverence and play to its actors strengths. It reminds me of Parks and Rec Season 1, in both set up and execution. In both shows, we have an optimistic main character navigating the bureaucracy and foolishness of the public sector in a small town. In Parks and Rec, you could feel the writers holding themselves back from some of their whackier impulses, before letting the full range of characters evolve and flex their comedic muscle in the second season onwards.",

Brian Jordan Alvarez plays his role exceptionally well and is very self aware in terms of what the atmosphere and personality the show is trying to evoke.Otherwise, I find the show generally quite boring. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table. It's obvious this show is being made on the realms of the success of Abbott Elementary but goes nowhere near the heights and emotional nor complexity that Abbott Elementary brings to its characters. Most of the side characters are relatively stale and surface level. They are really just there as points of context and humor in whatever issue the main character is facing.Most importantly, however, the jokes just feel too safe. They are trying very hard to be self aware in the public discourse primarily focused on social issues but we've seen all this done before. The show knows the viewer has to suspend disbelief in many of the scenarios presented but in trying so hard to focus on relevant issues it lacks any real punch in making a statement.It's all cute but very forgettable.",

It deals with identity, sexuality, and being a young adult in today's world. Alvarez gives a charming and relatable performance as Evan, capturing the endearing quirks and unwavering optimism of the character.The show is also sharp in its writing and clever in dialogue. The scripts are replete with witty banter, pop culture references, and insightful observations about contemporary issues. The series also boasts a talented supporting cast, including talented actors who bring depth and humor to their roles.While English Teacher is far from a revolution, this is a very entertaining viewing experience that will keep anyone thinking.

And I am here to tell you that English Teacher (2024-) is easily one of the biggest surprises of 2024 for me.Positives for English Teacher (2024-):\nI did get some enjoyment from watching a sitcom where the teachers of this high school are going through their lives while also trying to help their students succeed. This show isn't trying to be th best thing in television, it just trying to entertain you while also providing some representation for some communities and I had fun with that aspect of the show. I enjoyed the performances from the cast especially Brian Jordan Alvarez as Evan Marquez, Stephanie Koenig as Gwen Sanders, Enrico Colantoni as Grant Moretti and Sean Patton as Markie Hillridge. Also, the episodes are about 30 minutes long and they all go by fast. And finally, I can see this show improve itself with more seasons down the road.Negatives for English Teacher (2024-):\nThis show kinda feels similar to Abbott Elementary (2022-) and I couldn't help but notice the similarities between these two shows. Because of that, this show does look weaker in comparison to Abbott Elementary (2022-).Overall, English Teacher (2024-) was a massive surprise for me in 2024 and I can't wait to see if this show continues because I believe like to see more of these characters and their lives unfold.",

The characters and their relationships feel so unusually well developed for a show in its first season that they've quickly accomplished in only a few episodes what takes most new shows three seasons to do.

It cleverly skirts the edges of today's cultural wars, navigating the chaos of the culture wars with a clear, pointed perspective and leaving no side unscathed.

While the premise offers an intriguing perspective, the execution falls short in delivering a truly satisfying comedic experience.The show's topical humor, often focusing on LGBT issues and societal trends, feels overly explanatory and didactic, rather than humorous. The supporting cast, seemingly held hostage to the show's heavy-handed messaging, struggles to find their own comedic footing. The overall tone veers dangerously close to preachiness, undermining the show's comedic intentions.The inclusion of Trixie Mattel, a well-known drag queen, while adding a certain level of spectacle, doesn't necessarily contribute to the show's comedic value. Mattel's exaggerated Barbie doll aesthetic, while visually striking, fails to translate into the kind of comedic depth that the show desperately needs.Ultimately, Brian Jordan Alvarez's television debut, while well-intentioned, falls short of its potential. The show's overreliance on topical humor and didactic messaging leaves little room for genuine laughter or comedic exploration.

But then the propaganda took over. This could've been a really really good show. Such a shame. But I could not recommend it to anyone I know. Why do they need to subject us to this kind of back story (brainw**shing)? No one likes it. No one ever will, besides a tiny minority. Why can't they just make normal comedies any more?

Though the pundits and 'live action recreations' are sometimes a hit, sometimes a miss.The recolourised archival footage is truly spectacular. It brings the war from the myth of history to a lived human experience.This is particularly relevant now. Democratic decline is a rising tide. One that we are only beginning to wrestle with (even outside obvious examples). Appeasement in the face of imperialist aggression is spoken of as the lesser evil. These are dangerous waters and they are not new. History must be understood if it is not to be repeated.This is why I forgive the show for it's inclusion of politicians. Even those who probably have no right to be there.The link that it makes from the past to the present (aided through colour footage) is enough for me to view their inclusion as having value.Is the show a masterpiece?

Some of the most famous ones, that exist on audio files, were re-enacted. Arguably so that the difference between the great speaker and the AI version wouldn't be so blatantly obvious.20 minutes into the second episode we are given a rendering of Churchill's \"The fight on the beaches\" speech, if that doesn't leave you... speechless - you may just get through the rest of the series.Quite often, it can be good enough if a historical documentary \"catches the spirit of the moment\".

I've seen a lot of fans take issue with certain things, mostly because they go into this thinking they're getting Filmation 2. That company no longer exists and it's foolish to expect more of that. One thing I really liked, the core characters have matured and the fans aren't insulted by these characters remaining like it's still1980-something. This is very much a more mature take on He-Man, the cheesiness is gone and there's an actual story vs the bad guys are sent back to Snake Mountain vowing revenge. The stories aren't resolved in a half hour and the side of good has actual work to do to win the day. The two end credit scenes are very interesting, the first, you wonder how that'll play out.

        "body":"Though much derided in some quarters, I quite liked Kevin Smith's MOTU: Revelation. This follow up series was, he later revealed, guided by the Netflix algorithm to be five episodes instead of 12 and honestly, I think the algorithm was spot on, as this is a much leaner and better paced run.With Skeletor (Mark Hamill) haven fallen under the thrall of Hordak (Keith David) and Motherboard (Meg Foster) he attacks Eternia again, with his new technological powers. Though he's repelled by He-Man (Chris Wood), the assault brings about the death of King Randor (Diedrich Bader). Prince Adam then has to decide whether to take the throne or continue as his protector alter ego. Before he can decide though, Randor's estranged brother Keldor (William Shatner) returns and offers an alternative.Never any issues with the look of this version of \"Masters of the Universe\" and again this looks tremendous. The vocal performances from the returning cast are good and the addition of William Shatner, Keith David and John De Lancie only improves things. There's a little less humour this time, not none, but a little less certainly 'knowing' humour. The best performance probably comes from Lena Heady, whose Evil-Lyn returns and continues to be one of the few characters on a genuine arc.As with the second half of \"Revelations\" the story is focused and tight and is all the better for it. There are very few diversions, with even the potential \"fetch quest\" aspect of the Sorcerous' story being completed in just a couple of episodes. I hope that the viewing figures reflect the improvements that have gone into this run, as I'd certainly like to see more.",

I see a lot of these reviews saying the show is \"redeemed\" and are giving 8\/10 and 10\/10, I have to assume these reviews are either bots are people held at gunpoint. Is it better than the first attempt? Sure. But not by much, most of the characters spend their time expositioning so hard it sounds like they are reading from the Wikipedia of the show. The animation is amazing, but it's too bad they couldn't get better writing, characters spend most of their dialogue explaining the story to the Audience in a very unnatural way.

This series is just a complete jumbled mess. I know the series is called Masters of the Universe, so its not just about He-Man, but his absence of being a MASTER is just too much. Teela should not be more prominent. And Keldor should not be more prominent than Skeletor. Why did this series jump into the Matrix?? The constant glitchy computer effects in the cartoon itself is very annoying. This isn't a story we needed. The dialog is weak, the voice acting is atrocious (especially Cringer and BattleCat, and Transformers Skeletor), and EvilLynn and Teela were NEVER more powerful than Skeletor and He-Man. EvilLynn was smarter than Skeletor but not more powerful than him. Kevin Smith just loves to ruin stuff for fun huh?",

This is some of the best He-Man storytelling ever.Each iteration of the Masters universe has new takes and borrows from what came before. That's what's always fun about this franchise. It's designed to be \"played with\". The toys were the same. Here's general characters and now you make the story unfold.I was caught off guard by how some characters were used, but then I kept watching and really loved how it all played out.

I wasn't surprised that series got 5.6 stars.Then, when I looked at the second series of MOTU (Revolution), I saw it got 7.5 stars, so I became interested again. Maybe it actually got better, or - more accurately - maybe it actually got good.Then I remembered to look at the numbers properly.The first series got 5.6 stars based on approximately 30 thousand votes. The second series got 7.5 based on less than 3 thousand votes. That's a massive difference in votes!I'm guessing the people who voted so highly for Revolution, therefore, were mostly the small minority of people who liked (and probably voted so high) for the first series.On that note, there's no way in hell that I'll be giving the second series a chance, and I highly recommend you do the same. Watch something else instead that isn't politically pushy and preachy. Scavenger's Reign is excellent and so are many other awesome shows out there that are just trying to tell a good story.",

If you had any valid issues with Revelation don't let that put you off watching Revolution, you'll really enjoy it. To those fans that are a bit more casaul or folks just looking to get a hit of their childhood with He-Man, the champion has plenty screen time in Revolution and plenty action too so you'll have a blast.

        "body":"Having just revisited the 2021 series \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\" in order to fully appreciate and enjoy the 2024 sequel series titled \"Masters of the Universe: Revolution\", I must say that I was harboring some expectations to the sequel series.And the writers and creators delivered quite well. I found that \"Masters of the Universe: Revolution\" proved to be more enjoyable and entertaining that the first series. Why? Well, because the characters had been established, and you didn't have to squander 5 episodes on the Teela show here. Plus, there was just way more at stake in the storyline in \"Masters of the Universe: Revolution\", and with a prominent appearance of Hordak, well, what's not to like?The storyline in \"Masters of the Universe: Revolution\" is definitely aimed at a more mature audience than the 1980s series \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\". But at the same time, the writers manages to keep the spirit of the original 1980s series very much alive throughout the course of both the 2021 and 2024 series. But at the same time they add to the lore, and explore the characters. And much akin to \"Game of Thrones\", characters do happen to die in the show.Personally, I found the narrative and storyline in \"Masters of the Universe: Revolution\" to be better than \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\", as it was darker and more hard-hitting.Again, just as in the 2021, I am amazed with the voice acting talents that they mustered to get together for this series. There are so many great talents on the cast list.Visually, then \"Masters of the Universe: Revolution\" is good. They managed to keep the elements and spirit of the 1980s cartoon, whilst updating it to a more modern feel.Definitely an enjoyable show, and I have to say that \"Masters of the Universe: Revolution\" was better than the \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\" show. So if you enjoyed the 2021 series, you will love the 2024 series.My rating of \"Masters of the Universe: Revolution\" lands on a eight out of ten stars.",

        "body":"As a reboot of the iconic '80s series, \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\" might hold some appeal for a fresh, young audience experiencing Eternia for the first time. Its simplicity and adherence to the original could serve as an accessible entry point for children under ten, who are unacquainted with the lore of He-Man and his battles against Skeletor. However, for those of us who have grown up with the original series, this iteration falls short of expectations.The series attempts to strike a nostalgic chord but ends up playing the same tune without any modernization or significant depth. It's as if the showrunners decided to pick up right where the '80s left off, which might sound appealing on paper but feels out of touch with the contemporary landscape of animated storytelling.The dialogues often feel dated, lacking the wit and layers that current audiences have come to appreciate in animated series. The characters, while beloved, are presented with little to no development from their original personas. This not only makes them feel one-dimensional but also robs long-time fans of the opportunity to explore their favorite characters in new and meaningful ways.Visually, the series does little to push boundaries. While there's a certain charm in the retro style for those fond of the original, it's clear that the animation and shot composition have not evolved to meet today's standards. The action sequences, which should be a highlight, are often predictable and lack the dynamic flair that modern animation techniques can offer.The overall concept and execution of \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\" seem to be trapped in a bygone era. It's a homage that's too faithful to its source material, to the point of neglecting the chance to innovate or resonate deeply with those who have matured alongside the franchise.For new viewers, especially youngsters, \"Masters of the Universe: Revelation\" might be a passable adventure into the world of He-Man. But for the adult fans who have cherished the original series, this show is a stark reminder that sometimes, the past is best left as a fond memory, rather than a blueprint for new creations.",

Even good!However this is a direct continuation of the previews season \"Revelations\", and that directly insulted the franchise and its audience. So much insulting, one might think they did it on purpose.He-man was a franchise build to celebrate masculinity, and Revelations could only be described as if it was given to an activist feminist to insult it.He-man had a sailor moon transformation rather than \"getting the power\", died in the first episode, had the rains given to the only prominent woman of the team, redesigned her to take away any type of femininity of her looks and character, have her go into a lesbian relationship of a race swaped character from the comics, have the only evil female character change sides and become good, then travel to heaven to find He-man, barate him for being dead, throw him into the dirt, convice him to come back to life, and have him killed again. And that's just part one. And it's trailer tried to bait fans with the few cool he-man scenes from episode 1 and the song of \"I need a hero\"...\nYou can't make it worse if you tried!Now lets go to \"Revolution\".It's what the first series should had been, minus the hype, with a worse trailer, and with the disadvantage of being tied to it. Here's the good, as spoiler free as possible:\nFemale characters sudenly look a bit more feminine, but also a lot older since in S1 lots of time also passed. It pretends Tiela and Andra where never an item. He-Man is in the majority of the show (3,5\/5 episodes). There are cool action scenes and cool throwbacks to various spinn-off so they can pretend they know about them. It ends somewhat properly.Now for the Bad:\nIt presents as being He-man is incompatible with being King, when in it showed in their own very previous season they Showed that the first He-man was also a king, plus human history is full of warrior kings, who simply left governing to their advisors when going to war. It leans to variations of the franchise that I, and many others are not familiar with, and thus the bisare looks of He-man and some characters. The ending pretends to do good for the people, when examples from history suggest a Tyrant awaits them. There is actually an anti-vaccer messege...The question is not whether this is good, but whether this series deserves a \"third\" chance or forgiveness.",

The Ramsey family were certainly wealthy, and some viewed the pageant circuit as controversial. It could also be argued that the family was somewhat famous, at least in the immediate area, so check, check and check.Given Joel Berlingers diving into other cases, I went in hoping for a documentary that explored all aspects, and not just the popular narrative driven by legacy media. I was not disappointed.Given the perspective of The West Memphis Three, and how his and one other doc managed to overturn the insanity of 'Satanic Panic' and ultimately free three completely innocent young men, I'm hopeful that we may someday be able to say that Jon Benet wasn't harmed by Patsy, by Jon, or (the worst accusation I've heard) her brother, Burke.The ultimate failure ultimate goes to the ridiculous handling of the crime scene and that of the police. I've never seen such a mismanaged cluster by so many, who jumped to immediate conclusions, yet made absolutely zero effort to explore all options, and not just one.OF COURSE any investigation should and usually does center on the small inner circle, HOWEVER, you must simultaneously and methodically gather as much evidence as humanly possible, retain the integrity of the scene (remove all family immediately) and perform extensive and thorough forensic searches AND NOT TELL THE FAMILY TO DO SO, and CERTAINLY not alone. It's nothing short of a miracle that none of the family were charged- but they've certainly endured an ugly cloud of suspicion and ludicrous accusations since that day, and due to the complete and utter ineptitude of numerous law enforcement representatives, nothing of any substance was ever found.One hopes that, much the same as the Memphis Three case, if no one is arrested, maybe innocent people are able to prove their innocence.

        "body":"I have a strong suspicion that the \"creepy kid\" could be the real killer, with the parents possibly attempting to cover it up. His interview with the police and his peculiar behavior over time seem to suggest something is off. He consistently exhibits strange mannerisms and doesn't stray from his rehearsed lines during conversations. It all feels calculated and unsettling. The DNA must be manipulated by the parents ..who knows she wore the same underwear at the time of murder !! There are numerous accounts of the brother's troubling behavior, such as smearing feces on her bedroom walls and leaving unsettling \"gifts,\" like the Christmas package. These actions paint a picture of someone with deeper issues that may warrant closer scrutiny. It raises a valid question: why hasn't the investigation delved further into the brother's involvement? Given these red flags, it seems like a critical angle that has been overlooked.",

        "body":"I knew the case of the mysterious death of JonBenét Ramsey from podcasts. At first view, the case is like hundreds of others - the child goes missing, no one knows anything, no one has saw anything, so the parents are suspects. The difference, however, is that here the police literally did everything not to solve the investigation. They make a lot of mistakes, and while collecting evidence, they forget why they were summoned.Could we find out who killed the girl if only the police did what they should? I don't know, but it would be nice if the police were not extremely incompetent in such delicate cases.The documentary doesn't talk about anything that hasn't already been said. However, it's a very good summary of the investigation, the collected evidence and the theorys about the girl's death (perhaps focusing too much on one of the theories, but still).It's sad to watch documentaries like these, because they remind us that sometimes the perfect crime is the result of a lack of knowledge and investigative skills, not a calculating villain with super intelligence.It's worth watching, but it's even better to google the case and listen to a podcast about it (for example, \"Deception Detective\", who recorded 7.5 hours of material on the subject), because Netflix, as usual, omits a lot of police negligence, and oversimplifies some threads.",

However in viewing this documentary, I realize that's exactly what the Boulder PD wanted us all to think with the lies and misinformation they fed to the media. I am shocked that reviewers here are still clinging to the idea that the family was involved when the series showed a deposition of a police detective ADMITTING that there was ZERO evidence implicating the family. The same detective also admitted that the Boulder PD planted false information in the media and WITHHELD the exonerating DNA evidence, probably to cover up their absolute bungling of this case\/crime scene. These poor people were put through the wringer and while I didn't learn who murdered this poor child, I did learn once and for all that it was no one in the family.

        "body":"It can't be stressed enough that there was only one murder in Bolder in the year before the killing of JonBenet Ramsey. Inexperienced police, coupled with unprecedented media coverage, is a recipe for a corrupted crime scene, hasty conclusions, and an unprofessional refusal to admit mistakes as additional facts come to light. Retired Detective Smit emerges as a voice of reason, professionalism, and wisdom.The beauty pageants seem odd at first glance, yet wealthy parents encouraging charismatic kids to perform and compete is only creepy when a pedophile joins the audience. Shirley Temple was an uncontroversial star in the 1930s with routines and roles that put her precociousness in the spotlight. In the late 90s, the innocence of the kids and applause of parents and grandparents may well have been tainted by a serpent in the room.While a sick photographer or fringe character may have become obsessed at a pageant, the real story is profiteering media looking to make entertainment from tragedy, and detectives looking for a book deal and notoriety. DNA science has come a long way since 1997, yet tainted samples are not likely to lead to justice. The documentary does a very good job of digging deep and exploring many possibilities.The appeal and spread of unlikely conspiracy theories has become much more prevalent in the years subsequent to the murder. Amateur sleuths who favor the fantastical over the factual are everywhere, yet Detective Smit, along with some retired detectives and investigative reporters, provides evidence that professionalism and a genuine desire to ferret out the truth can still be found. Director\/Producer Joe Berlinger has a long track record of stellar work, dating back to Brother's Keeper (1992). Recommended.",

Absolutely nothing new is presented in this documentary, nothing that the public needed to know anyway and it begs the question of who thought we needed to be reminded of this tragedy, especially when absolutely no new facts are brought to light.I suppose it is to bring more attention to the case in the hopes of solving it, but those fake internet sleuths aren't going to break this case open because they are self-gratifying hacks who revel in their own delusional beliefs on their abilities as \"detectives\" so what's the point of this documentary?

Her and her family became like family so much that if you visited my grandparents in Saskatchewan you could see pics of Reena there.I gave 8 stars because there were certain aspects I didn't like. I wish they had kept the location much smiliar to what it truly is. The series portrayed it as remote and with no one around in any direction. If you google the Craigflower Bridge in Saanich you will see it's surrounded in 2 directions with lots of people as well as the traffic. When you see how populated the area is it makes it even more shocking that no one heard or saw anything.The other issue I has was on the portrayal of Manjit. He is a soft spoken man but they portray him more like a pushover and someone who can't speak for himself or his family whon he showed in all interviews that is far from the truth.The mini series was pretty accurate and and I definitely recommend. When it comes to to a series like this and a review from someone who knew them personally the review could be very good or very bad but I will say I recommend.One last thing I'll share is my fave memory of Reena. They were Jehovahs Witness so they didn't celebrate holidays. She loved coming over for the holidays and seeing the decorations everywhere. One year on Halloween she was so sad because she had never been trick or treating so I grabbed a pillow case and we went across the street to our neighbours house and she got to trick or treat. She didn't have a costume or even care because in that moment she was truly happy and that's the memories of Reena I will always remember.",

        "body":"I have been a resident of Victoria BC for about 35 years and this is one of two stories that will always upset me when I think about it, the other being the disappearance of Michael Dunahee.I was only 9 when Reena was murdered but to this day I remember the news coverage and the overall shock felt throughout Victoria was absolutely heartbreaking, for me personally I remember how upset I was at the thought of how scared Reena was and what she went through physically before she died. Those feelings have never gone away to this day and I bet they never will.The ripple effect it had on those in Victoria regardless if they knew Reena Virk or not was absolutely indescribable. As I'm sure you know by watching this series, hearing about the story beforehand or from living in or close to Victoria, the way Reena was murdered was absolutely horrific to say the very least. I don't even want to compare this to an animalistic act because even wild animals would have more compassion than what was shown to Reena that horrific and unforgettable night.Its interesting how someone's story can stick with you for your entire life even if you didn't know the victim or their family before or after the crime against them took place. My heart still and always will go out to Reena, The Virk family as well as her friends. I'll never fully know what they went through and what Reena's family and friends will always go through. Those that commited this disgusting crime will never receive the justice they TRULY deserve. I think Reena's story and the story of every murder victim should be a reminder that our justice system needs A LOT of work. Reena, her family and her friends has and always will be in my heart, especially while I drive over the bridge where this crime took place. I'm grateful Reena's story is being told in a way that many outside of Victoria can learn about it because Reena's story NEEDS to be told, so thank you to those that did this show to the best of their ability. Thus far it did have some points that didn't completely express the way this crime effected so many people, but I feel it has done well so far.Rest In Peace Reena Virk, March 10, 1983 - November 14, 1997.",

I have connections to this story that I don't want to make public but to say the least I was very interest in how this story would come to be on the screen. It's that time honored tradition of be careful when something is \"based\" on a true story.Fair warning I couldn't finish the second episode because everything around the murder is heighted for television drama. When your main character is the author of a book about the crime written after the fact but somehow the show puts her there as the murder is going on is beyond me. All this does it take the focus of the real victim Reena Virk.Not to mention in the real world Victoria is the 12th largest city in Canada and not some rural run town poor town like in the show. I had to laugh because the real Craigflower bridge is right by the Old Island Highway and one of the busiest intersections in the city and not surrounded by nothing like the show. When in reality this all went down in such a high traffic area is more shocking than this show where the population of 200 live miles from everyone and everywhere.We owe it to the memory of Reena Virk to remember her story and the tragic details and not some fantasy made up to celebrate a writer with a tangential connection to the murder. From what I've seen from these first two episodes the show is more interested in the murders (truly awful people that got away way to lightly if you read the truth and not watch this show) than the victim herself. More interested in creating false narratives that work for TV but have nothing to do with real life.Victoria and the family of Reena Virk deserve better, the scum involved in the actual crime deserve worse.",

Then Javon Walton or Ashtray from \"Euphoria\" who is now all grown up and can really flex his dramatic acting chops, while channeling a young Ryan Philippe. And the show is lucky to have cast Archie Panjabi, a veteran British actress typically in detective roles, but here she plays the role of the mother so delicately.

I thought the episode when Reenas parents meet was unnecessary, I get they wanted to paint a picture of her dad, but it didn't need an entire boring episode.some of the characters seemed 2 dimensionalseemed like they were trying to paint the ppl that committed these crimes as more of a victim than the actual victim . I have a feeling it's because this is based on Rebecca G. Book.acting wasn't great in the beginning, but it does get better toward the end.My complaints about the characters ( I won't hold this against the show because they are playing real people)I absolutely couldn't stand this Rebecca character.Her relationship with these young kids is \"cringe\" and I rarely use that word, but it's true. As someone that has worked with kids before, the way she acts around them like they are best friends makes me lose respect for her, even if her goal is to write a book. Again , but if this is how the story actually went down, then she clearly didn't care about Reena. Her goal was to write about how ppl can make mistakes and are still good ppl no matter what, just because she had her own issues. And if this show is accurate to what really happened, I really think she had a crush on this boy, apparently she described him as \" boyish good looks, a hearthrob\" in her book. She cared more about him than about Reena. If they went of her book then I have a hard time believing any of the acting that was portrayed for Warren, obviously her pov is warped.I can't imagine how Reenas family feels. It's one thing to acknowledge that ppl make mistakes, but it's another to feel more sorry for the ppl that are not the actual victims.",

Each) opens, it is \"November 14, 1997\" and we are introduced to Reena, a teenage girl of Indian descent. She is trying hard to fir in with other girls her age, but it isn't easy. In a parallel story, we are introduced to Rebecca, who is visiting from New York as she is working on a book about Victoria, BC, where she grew up... At this point we are 10 minutes into Episode 1.Couple of comments: this mini-series is the brainchild of Quinn Shepard (\"Not Okay\"). Here she brings the book of the same name by Rebecca Godfrey to the small screen. I was mesmerized from the start, lured by the top notch script and strong performances by the cast (led by Riley Keough as Rebecca and Lily Gladstone as Cam). At this point I have seen 4 of the 8 episodes. It becomes clear very quickly who is responsible for the murder of Reena, so I was wondering why the mini-series would need so many episodes. Only tot then find out that more layers are peeled back, as we get the full picture of how the family from India settles in Victoria and tries to integrate. Beware: there are a number of scenes that will make you quite uncomfortable but sometime the truth ain't pretty, and that's being mild. Looking forward to watching the remaining 4 episodes in the weeks to come.\"Under the Bridge\" is streaming on Hulu and new episodes are released on Wednesdays. The mini-series is currently rated 88% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and for good reason.

I just watched Natalie Dormer's \"White Lies,\" another new murder mystery, and the difference in production value is big, with \"Under the Bridge\" being much better.

The \"gang\" of girls are convincingly annoying teenagers, and you can easily tell who's the good kid, who's the psycho, who's trying to fit in, etc. Lily Gladstone is the standout for me. I like Riley Keough, but her performance here is similar to her usual ones, so if you didn't like her before, this won't change your mind.The murder mystery is okay, but aside from being based on a true story, there isn't much to suck you in make the series feel special. It feels like a surface-level dive into the tragic events and characters. Especially if you compared it to true detective for instance.A kid is found dead, which is a sad story. The children are mostly troubled, but the show depicts most of them as misfits who cause a lot of trouble, and not in a fun or endearing way. Even Reena herself. So in the end I found it hard to be invested enough in the characters care for them. It's an okay watch but not something that will stick with you.",

From the very outset, it asserts itself as a tour de force in the realms of mystery, crime, and edge of your seat suspense. The narrative unfolds with a deft hand, drawing audiences into a world where every twist and turn leaves us yearning for more.At the heart of this captivating tale is the incomparable Lily Gladstone, whose portrayal of the lead character is nothing short of mesmerizing. Having previously graced the screen in Martin Scorsese's epic \"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" Gladstone brings a depth and nuance to her role that is simply unparalleled. Alongside her, the young actors deliver performances far beyond their years, immersing us in the raw reality of their characters' lives.While some viewers may find themselves initially unsure of the inclusion of Riley Keough, it's evident that every casting choice in \"Under the Bridge\" serves a purpose. Keough's presence, though perhaps not immediately resonant, adds layers to the narrative that promise to unfold in intriguing ways as the series progresses. Indeed, part of the allure of \"Under the Bridge\" lies in its ability to subvert expectations and challenge preconceived notions.Credit must also be given to the masterful direction that permeates every frame of the series. Each scene is crafted with a keen eye for detail, drawing us deeper into the labyrinthine world of the story. The intensity that pulses through every moment keeps us on the edge of our seats, eagerly anticipating what lies around the next corner.As I eagerly await the next installment, I can't help but reflect on the impact that \"Under the Bridge\" has already made. In a landscape inundated with content, it stands out as a shining beacon of excellence. With its captivating performances, expertly crafted narrative.",

Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of that- but they don't take the often exploitative approach that the true crime genre often takes. For me, this has been an incredible series- from the screenplay, to casting, to acting and sequence of episodes. I am usually seeped in emotions throughout the show, ranging from anger to sadness to sympathy and empathy- bc this is a story about kids, some of them deeply failed by the adults in their life, others just not in a place they can appreciate it yet (like most teenagers). So I would not say watch this for a comfort show, but if you find comfort in connecting deeply through characters on screen, then maybe it's for you. I also really appreciate that they used age-appropriate actors for the kids. It feels more genuine and able to recognize, that these were all effing kids, which is mind blowing.",

Once the law closes in and arrests made it was all downhill for me. The mystery is solved by the very unspectacular truths. The rest of the episodes have to rely on dull drama and acting which bored me to tears.There were many unexplained \"evidence\" items or material references that just fell off the map.

My biggest annoyance with this series, is Rebecca. I've read that for a start she wasn't actually involved with the police, so this fictionalised aspect seems like an unnecessary perspective. Especially when her involvement isn't really there to serve justice for the victim but rather to stick up for and protect a perpetrator. Her character is extremely annoying and acts like a child. Why is she hanging out with kids, it's just strange and gross under the circumstances. Like I say, I haven't read the book so I don't know if she portrays herself in this way but she isn't alive now to ensure she doesn't look like a creep and in my opinion she looks like one in this series.As a \"who did it\" series it is decent and worth a watch, but because it is based on something tragic that really happened I just think the inaccuracy seems disrespectful and it would have been better if it was more Reena focused than Rebecca focused.",

The real 'Dusty' was none of that.I liked, however, that the producers didn't make the entire show about Reena's race. Everyone was portrait as a real person, with good and bad qualities, with mistakes and (mostly) remorses.",

Sure they can be lackadaisical about some girl missing for a few days if it's happened before but if the family is stating that something is different it should be looked into. If the show is accurate apparently one cop did. The worst part is the victim herself is extremely unlikable. Insecure, spiteful, disrespectful to her parents and listens to total trash rap music. So it's hard to care what happened to her. I only care about justice for the parents, not for her. Still it looks like it might be a good crime limited series. Will keep watching for now.",

Reena tries so hard to fit in with the popular kids, who all happen to be wannabe thugs that live in an orphanage of sorts. Reena has a full family that love and support her, but she craves friendship, or belonging. A former resident of the orphanage comes back to write about the area, only to end up writing about what happens with the murder.The miniseries was hard to like, but that was intentional. The girls that Reena tries so hard to like are completely irredeemable, terrible, disgusting and not worth the trouble that arises. I will never understand why people want to be so mean to each other. I will never understand why teenagers think rebellion means desiring a life in prison, thus earning some mysterious street cred that nobody cares about.The production, the acting, the mystery and the 90s setting all work really well together, keeping my interest piqued week after week as the show aired. It was a truly appalling story, and my heart goes out to the family. But I'm glad the story was told so Reena was not forgotten.",

Many series have the author as an executive director to ensure the book's underlying message and direction are conveyed the same in the series. But, that's it. The series or movie itself is another creative material, and they sometimes lose direction or objectivity of the situation when the author takes it too personally. Making Rebecca a character in the show makes everything messy.Rebecca's story is on the side while Reena's story is the main narrative. Two are not very complementary. It feels as if Rebecca is trying to crawl to the center stage and to interrupt while Reena's holding the mike. Cam's search for her root and confusion about her ethnicity squeeze in as well, and 'Under the Bridge' feels crowded even though it's really not because the three storylines do not harmonize. Moreover, Rebecca's obsession with Warren's so called good heart and romantic relationship between Becca and Cam cram into already existing chaos so suddenly, popping out of nowhere.However, it's just hard not to watch the next episode. Please tell me more!! What happened under the bridge, teenagers' struggles and loneliness, and the process of bullying and what's going on in the victim's and perpetrator's mind while bullying are persuasively and engrossingly portrayed.",

It is low-budget, it stars relative unknowns, the \"mystery\" is solved early in the series, it relies heavily on flashbacks, it takes place in a town better known for seniors' buffets than crime, and -- oh yeah -- it is Canadian. But looks are deceiving. The script is tight. And the rotating team of Directors know how to get the most of their cast. Best of all, lurking below the surface, are the time-honored elements of a battle between Good and Evil. The notion of teenage girls as killers was almost unheard of at the time of the events in the story. These days, the idea has a little more traction. The story, told over 8 episodes, always holds the attention. And the girls are always creepy. Recommended.

The girls were left in a foster home, and Warren was a thug, being forgotten by the society. No wonder they became violent and ruthless. Teens in their age, growing up in a place like that, are more likely to commit a crime. They need to be properly educated, they need a family that love them.So glad to see Riley Keough again, and big kudos to Lily who portrayed the cop. She was a good cop, never gave up finding the truth, never stopped looking. She was stern to the criminals but also compassionate. The show was generally good, but it became a teen drama, romance and a history of the Virks after 2 episodes. Not much of crime based stories: we will know what happens to Reena and who is behind all of it in the first two episodes.Genrerally, the show also reflects the lives of immigrants from Asia in the 70s\/80s: they had difficulties to integrate into the society, or they didn't want to be part of the society at all. They kept their old customs at home, and so on. This is still the case nowadays. Racism is not allowed in any sort but, if they believe that they are being unfairly treated, or their cultures are superior, they are most welcome to go back to where they are from. Why stay in a country that you think is full of racism and unfairness, while harping on how good your country is. This is a fact, this is a truth.",

        "body":"Under the Bridge tells the story of the murder of a 14-year-old Reena Virk (Gupta) and the subsequent trial that follows. Rebecca Godfrey (Keough) is writing a new story after returning to her hometown of Victoria and interviews some of her troubled classmates, Josephine Bell (Guidry), Kelly Ellard (Izzy G), Warren Glowatzki (Walton) and Dusty Pace (Goodfellow) as well as the local sheriff investigating the murder, Cam Betland (Gladstone) as well as her parents Suman (Panjabi) and Manjit Virk (Khan). As the story unfolds, the lives of these characters unravel, the secrets, the troubles and previous lies come back and complicate everything.The first two episodes of the story were really gripping, the characters are well set up and the mystery and commentary are compelling. The cast works well and is very good at embodying their roles. The motivations are clear, the setting is well realized and the payoffs are quite clever, however afterwards the story just drags on. The characters lie and that is understandable for their motivation, however the biggest liar in the show is the narrative being spun.When writing a mystery that spans eight episodes and six hours, it is important to make every minute count. As a result, there are mysteries with greater implications but these implications are framed manipulatively. There is a difference between hooking a mystery by implying a potential murderer or being coerced into making a false confession and lying to the audience. This show will often end on the 'cliffhanger' that would imply something greater but then in the next episode retract that cliffhanger as some big misunderstanding, or worse, a meaningless fib. Implications when used well are effective ways to keep the slow burn, but this show more often tells us what we should think instead of unraveling ambiguous details into an engaging mystery. I understand these plot beats happened in real life, but they need to be structured better so not to constantly cheat the audience.This show does get credit for finding good actors that are the age they are supposed to be. It must not have been easy to cast this show given how many series cast twenty to thirty-year-olds as teenagers and thirty to forty-year-olds as their parents. Also the portrayal of poor and working class life, Indian Immigrant and Indigenous Canadian assimilation into a predominantly white society are interesting to see in addition to the mystery. I liked a lot of the material, the slow burn, the cast and performances and the city of Victoria has never looked better. This show could have been a really important miniseries about the murder of a second-gen lower-to-middle class immigrant, a disposable 'Bic girl' trying to fit into her Caucasian neighbourhood and friend group; but the frustrating and deceitful narrative will turn some people off.",

Bullying is not a victimless crime or a phase that everyone goes thru. It's a crime and there are consequences.

I never understood the purpose of Rebecca. The thing I do know is that instead of trying to understand what really led this kids to commit this crime, what were the social circumstances, the environment, etc etc, we spend time with an irrelevant character the contributed absolutely nothing to the story.Instead of getting to know the victim, Reena, we were basically only informed about her bad choices and her need to belong with the \"cool\" kids. Nothing else. Like she never existed before she met these kids that sealed her destiny.But it was obvious this show wasn't about Reena, the victim. Do you see Reena in the show's banner\/poster?

The cast, including the dozens of extras that add layers of believability to the odd little Irish town.The story, a cold case about a long ago trio of missing persons, combines with a creaky Pod-cast Scooby Do adventure, and it meanders a lot. This makes the early episodes a bit slow. The action picks up in the later episodes starting with #5. However, the narrative begins to jump around a lot, flashbacks from other characters perspectives, and hops from one character to another too often.The eventual resolution of the multiple threads is both a bit of a letdown, and a whirlpool of wrong assumptions getting vetted one by one.The comedy isn't as non-stop as some reviews and the trailer suggests. It's dark and filled with the personal demons of the heroes complicating their efforts. The personal renaissance each person goes through is satisfying, if a little too neatly accomplished. There are some sly funny moments though, filled with irony and a lack of self awareness.The three protagonists are conflicted individuals, performed very well by a surprising cast. Siobhan Cullen's Dove is an unrepentant b!+@# who has big problems brewing back home in London. Robyn Cara, who has made a career of playing ditzy characters, at first seems to be playing true to form, but her character Emmy reveals more depth and complexity as each episode unspools. Will Forte is an acquired taste, and his character, Gilbert, is a doofus who's made big mistakes that are nipping at his heels. He continually gets in his own way trying to be nice. Fortunately he becomes less of a tool as the season nears its conclusion.David Wilmot turns in a great performance as Seamus Gallagher, the mysterious townsman with a scary past, who is trying to embrace a \"normal\" life.I recommend it, it isn't high art but there are some laughs and good performances..",

        "body":"I thoroughly enjoyed Bodkin and highly recommend it to mystery fans who like small town mysteries with quirky characters.This was so much fun...it starts with an American podcaster named Gilbert Power, who is played endearingly by the funny Will Forte. He had success in his first podcast season solving a cold case. The key to his success was really the fact that he opened up emotionally and shared what he and his dying wife were going through. Since the first season his podcast has struggled, but he is on a trip sponsored by a British newspaper to look into a missing person's case in the small Irish town of Bodkin. To accompany him on this trip is a Pollyanna-like young assistant named Emmy (Robyn Cara) and a dour investigative journalist named Dove Maloney (Siobhán Cullen). Dove wants to be anywhere but playing sidekick to a fake journalist like the podcaster Gilbert.The beauty of this small town mystery is all the quirky characters...like their driver Seán, who thinks he is an Albanian orphan adopted by his single mom and as such listens to Albanian rap music, Seamus who may or may not be a smuggler, Teddy who sings like an angel and is an amazing blacksmith...but has suffered a brain trauma, Maeve and Frank who live like hippies...or their own version of it \"Peace, Love, and Pay your xxx debts.\", a nun named Mother Bernadette who is running a nunnery that is more like a spa\/yoga retreat, then there is the local boy Fintan who made big with his server farm etc and now is back home wanting to reinstate the town's Samhain...then there is the thespian undertaker...the list just goes on and on.The town hasn't celebrated Samhain since three locals went missing twenty years prior on that night. This is the mystery that our gang of three is looking into. The podcasting element was entertaining, especially since they poke fun of it and it's popularity. The mystery was actually decent and I loved the twists and turns. The one character I found difficult to watch was Dove, her ends justifies the mean's attitude was really tiring and frankly watching her be downright cruel to people was not entertaining. The reverse was true about Seamus and his kind treatment of Gilbert especially over his troubles with his wife...which was surprisingly tender and heartfelt.The comedy was great and we found ourselves laughing out loud...the mystery however is what really kept us involved till the very end. I loved seeing everything come together. I was able to solve parts of the mystery before they were revealed, but it didn't hamper my enjoyment.",

It's more in the genre of 'Dead Like Me' and 'Hot Fuzz' or even 'Only Murders in the Building' only darker and with less deadpan and slapstick humor.One who gave it a 1 rating because a dog was shot begs belief. Plus they argued it was seen writhing in blood and was purely gratuitous without contributing anything to the story. This couldn't be further from the truth. It was basically killed 'off camera' and exposed exactly what that violent family was all about. It also confirmed that they would have killed Seamus' brother and Fiona had they found them years earlier. It was a shocking and senseless act on their part which proved they meant business in their hunt for Seamus. I, for one, totally expected it. It also gave us another opportunity to witness the softer side of Seamus.This, plus all the other low scores, don't affect it's well-deserved 7 as a show worthy of at least checking out. It's compact so it's a great binge-watch. It's either your cup of tea or it isn't.This original series takes the viewer through many plot twists and turns with lots of red herrings and cliff hangers at the end of each episode that leave the viewer wanting more. Towards the end of episode 5, which revealed a lot of answers, I was hoping there would be more and was very happy to see the Netflix info that there were two more episodes to go.The basic premise has been well documented by other reviewers. A positive, upbeat one-hit-wonder American podcaster (David Wilmot) who, in spite of a flagging career and financial and marital problems comes to the ficticuous west coast Irish town of Bodkin to document a 25yr old missing persons mystery.Three people went missing during their annual pagan festival and he hopes a closer investigation of the facts for his podcast will renew his fame. He never anticipates solving the mystery but with the aid of his young, wide-eyed novice researcher (Robyn Cara) and the addition of a disgraced investigative journalist from the 'Guardian' (Siobhan Cullen), they begin to dig deeper into the mystery. She smells a real story and although her boss just wanted her to lay low with these guys to avoid censure for her part in the suicide of a whistleblower she was working with, she can't help herself getting them deeply involved and taking the podcast to a whole new level.There are as many real life elements as stereo-typical and ludicrous ones which keep this show darting between mysterious drama and dark humor. I, personally, would have liked it to have been a bit more obviously humorous but the mystery unfolds in such surprising ways I was still hooked.I disagree with others who felt the reveals were anti-climatic ... I think they worked well with the pacing and tone...but I have to admit I was disappointed with the ending. I wanted different outcomes for the three musketeers but that's colored by my set of values and by the fact I may have begun to take it all a bit too seriously.It's been difficult to try to describe this inventive series without giving away any spoilers.The acting was great from the whole ensemble, the writing clever and inventive, the pacing was a bit chaotic and the scenes a bit choppy at times but not nearly as much as in 'Hot Fuzz' which I really loved but felt it was often like different movies cobbled together in the way they switched from slick 'The Borne Identity' scenes to 'Midsomer Murders' at it's best. This was not the case here but the introduction of the incompetent and OTT Interpol agents certainly are a case in point. The show would slow down and speed up awkwardly at times and often the humor following a serious or personally revealing scene just didn't quite work for me. I wonder if the lack of fluidity was somewhat related to the switch in directors during the series. This is normal in episode fiction but perhaps a few of these directors were not as capable of keeping the delicate balance and continuity of this specific style of show as well as others. I think you have to be aware this is not going to be your typical true crime mystery series and stick with it past episodes one and two. You're in for a treat... or at least a very different viewing experience.",

        "body":"If this was supposed to be a comedy-mystery, it fails as both. The dialogue is not amusing, the plot is haphazard, and every single character is unlikeable. The few winning scenes it has are far outweighed by the many unpleasant, dreary or awkward ones.The American podcaster is a dolt and, while this is supposed to be funny, it falls flat, perhaps because he seems to be genuinely a jerk with some very unappealing problems. Similarly, the high-powered journalist on the team is narcissistic and irritating for all but about thirty seconds of the seven-episode series. The Irish townsfolk have a few amusing quirks but their secrets are too dark and too complicated to to find droll or interesting.As for the plot, there are too many crimes, too many interlocking relationships, too many secrets and too many players. There is even gratuitous violence, surprising for what I thought would be an offbeat series in a rustic setting. There is the obligatory diverse casting, all races and sexual orientations covered, with very little chemistry among the characters. There are also some obligatory Irish stereotypes of a sort that would be off-limits if attempted with any other religious or national group.After the teasers, I was really looking forward to this series. Sadly, it's a complete let down.",

I was rolling my eyes at the flaws that first just made them fun, human characters but were now just getting in the way of my enjoyment of the series. Additionally, their personal growth happened quite suddenly, which added to the chaos and oddness of these last episodes. It's like I was watching a different kind of show. I am left feeling both relieved that it's over and annoyed that it's ended like this.

Im sure this show is not the only one to do this (Archive 81 comes to mind) but i really enjoyed that. The location, town of Bodkin in is a perfect setting for mystery, it adds to the atmosphere so much, the small coastal place far away enough to be perfect hiding place for some people. The characters are ok, i didnt really like Gilbert as much as Dove or Emmy but they delivered as a team, very obviously not from Bodkin as many locals will have no problem pointing out and referring to them as \"the podcasters\".

        "date":"2024-05-14",
        "body":"As always, no spoilers in my reviews.The attraction that murder mysteries have to us as an audience is well-known. As such, to no one's surprise, the genre is not uncommon in televised entertainment. From the more classic approach of miniature investigations in each episode, like CSI, to longer-lasting and overarching bigger mysteries, like Sherlock or Luther, mystery dramas tend to do well. But is 'well' really good enough anymore? What makes a murder mystery lasting in our increasingly limited memory. Do we prefer the central characters developing, or do we instead give favor to a more complex mystery? Or, in rare cases, can we get both? As Jez Schafer and Alex Metcalf worked on Bodkin together, they must have had the same questions. But while entertainingly lighthearted and plain and simple fun, Bodkin is worthy of your time, while slipping away from memory.Bodkin's primary elements fixate on a disappearance mystery, investigated by a wildly differing trio, aided by and worked against an array of support characters, while all being set against the backdrop of an idyllic and small Irish town. Our trio consists of famous podcaster Gilbert Power (Will Forte), wreck'em-up-styled journalist Dove (Siobhán Cullen) and newcomer-so-naive Emmy (Robyn Cara). Gilbert is a cheery and happy-go-lucky American, as typical as they come, while his assistant Emmy is a bit more realistically balanced. Dove is, more times than I'd want, an excruciatingly cynical and pessimistic reporter, with a somewhat understandable reason as to why she is the way she is. Bodkin also features many extra characters, of which David Wilmot, playing a fierce Seamus Gallagher, is the most noteworthy. Not saying the other characters are fuel for boredom, but... they just don't linger. Sadly, it is a returning feature for Bodkin, specifically in the first half of the show, to choose quantity over quality.Don't get it wrong: Bodkin is entertaining television. As nearly each episode is formatted in a same manner, working from its last cliffhanger to the next, you'll be enticed to watch one more, 6 times in a row. It is however, not a very strong case for a compelling mystery drama, if it seeks to lean on cheap tricks and predictable endings. As the episodes go by, so does the mystery and its supposed revelations, but none of it really sticks. It goes onward to provide us with a satisying ending, albeit it a bit far-fetched at times. Then again, Bodkin was inspired by something overheard in a pub... That's to say, Bodkin does its thing as you'd expect from a murder mystery, pushing the story forward bit by bit, allowing for some room of character development and the occassional knee-slapper. But I can't help but feel it could've been a lot more than that, with just a little bit extra.Instead, Bodkin tries to do too much, with too little effort. Inclining you wish to uphold high standards, character development is lacking truly shaping events, humor that was supposed to be dark is rather run-of-the-mill instead, and dialogue is predictable and of little substance. While the show juggles several storylines among an ever-forwarding central mystery, it sacrifices true art for a quick and mild success. As a concrete result, the stories together create a strange sort of pace, ultimately rushed down in simplicity and eager to leave not a trace of grandure, but of a fun and satisfying mystery. But if it is that lighthearted Saturday-evening entertainment you're searching for, make no mistake, Bodkin will deliver.Bodkin receives a 7 out of 10.",

It's a bit of miscasting that ruins this otherwise fine show.The other actors are fine and the direction is tight and imaginative. The script is also above average.

        "body":"This series is a mystery with little comedy. Its filming location is southwestern Ireland in Cork County. The films settings are an impressive viewing of the landscape of the county. The coast is rugged and rocky North Atlantic. The vegetation is luscious green as is Ireland's reputation. An engaging comment in the film is that the rain is heavy or light but still always their unseen in tiny droplets settling on the land. The language is English mixed with captivating Irish. The roads are unpaved, and walking is common. There is no modern architecture. Clothing is heavy as the climate is cool and wet. The mystery is hard to follow and likely requires a second viewing for optimal appreciation. There are a fair number of eerie scenes of the supernatural. Memories of childhood trauma play a role. The end clears up the mystery of the series. It will not be appreciated nor understood unless the whole series is viewed in sequence. I do not recall ever viewing such an Irish series that seems native to the country.",

It follows a podcaster, a hard hitting report and a newspaper assistant as they try to solve a two decades old mystery while each dealing with their own issues. There were lots of twists and for the most part it seem to all make sense in the world that they built.In addition to the three leads there were several other interesting characters, most of whom are pretty obnoxious. It made me wonder if there are any pleasant people in Ireland.I think the biggest pitfall of the series was the ending. Not to give anything away, but the geography of the big final event didn't seem to make any sense to me.But other than that I enjoyed the humor and the constant twists and turns through out this series.",

Special mention to Siobhan Cullen, Robyn Cara, David Wilmot and especially Fionnula Flanagan.

The gravelly former gun smuggler who still has a bit of Semtex laying around. An Irish lad who's a bit daft but he has a heart o gold so he does. Let's not forget the bumbling village policeman. I could go on.As underwhelming as the first 6 episodes were, the finale is where it gets cringingly ridiculous.There was potential for a good show here but in trying to cover so many moods and genres it became a jack of all trades, yet failed to achieve anything resembling competence, much less becoming a master of any of them.",

Evil seems to be lurking around every corner. And then a really good thriller develops along the way. Why did three people disappear 20 plus years ago?

I was half expecting to see Brendan O'Carroll turn up along the way.The main female character (brilliantly played by Siobhán Cullen) must be one of the most hateful I've ever witnessed.Bad language can often be very funny but here, while initially funny, it is completely overdone and eventually becomes tiresome.I think overall \"Bodkin\" probably deserves a 6 out of 10.",

The pacing is off and it doesn't really pick up until the third episode. The Red King shows how a story like this should be done. Three podcasters arrive on Bodkin to investigate the mystery of the disappearance of three people during the Samhain Festival 20 years before, A local entrepreneur, he runs a server farm, is now organising the first Samhain Festival to be held since then. There are secrets in Bodkin, some are kept by nuns who run yoga workshops and drink pints in pubs, others are kept by smugglers but no one will talk about the disappeared. To add to the mix one of the podcasters, investigative reporter Dove (Siobhán Cullen) has been sent by her editor to cool her heels in Ireland after a source \"commits suicide\". There is a lot of humour in Bodkin, Dove perhaps having the best lines but there's also some serious criminal business going down. INTERPOL, MI5 and the troubles rear their ugly heads. It might also be a bit too clever for it's own good with the plot twists but it is worth watching. You might think some of the locals are unbelievably weird but this is West Cork.

        "body":"The series is a thriller and mystery that has captured the audience's attention with its compelling plot. Created by a talented team of writers and directors, the show attempts to blend suspense and intrigue with a deep exploration of human relationships.The story revolves around a mysterious event that strikes a quiet community, triggering a series of events that test the relationships among the characters. However, at times, the narrative tends to generate confusion rather than suspense or interest. The intricate plots, while designed to keep viewers on the edge of their seats, can often feel unclear, diminishing emotional engagement and making it difficult to follow the storyline.The characterization of the characters is another aspect that leaves much to be desired. While they have unique and potentially interesting backstories, the characters do not show significant evolution throughout the series. This leads to challenges in forming genuine attachments, making it harder for the audience to invest emotionally in their journeys.Visually, the series showcases high-quality cinematography. The choices in framing and lighting are effectively used to create a tense and unsettling atmosphere. The settings are well-crafted and contribute to establishing the tone of the narrative, adding an extra layer of engagement for viewers.The soundtrack, composed to reflect the characters' emotions and the tensions of the plot, further enriches the viewing experience. The music fits seamlessly into key moments, intensifying the emotional impact of the scenes.However, despite its strengths, the story and finale have more potential than power. The premise is intriguing and full of possibilities, but the way it unfolds can leave viewers feeling unsatisfied. The expectations created by an initially captivating plot are not always met by a resolution that may seem lacking in impact.In summary, the series seeks to combine suspense and drama but has several shortcomings. With a compelling plot and well-crafted visuals, it positions itself as a notable work in the landscape of contemporary television. Yet, issues of narrative confusion, lack of character evolution, and a finale that does not fully realize the story's potential may limit its overall impact. It offers an engaging experience, but may not completely satisfy everyone's expectations.",

Dick Wolf, has a Midas touch with criminal and law themes, has always taken true, real life crimes and court cases and turned them into high quality shows. That's what makes his shows work. They are always based in real, true life cases. In fact some of his shows were forced to cancel because they were too honest and got to close to the truth. It's really good to see him do a docuseries from the people who lived through the cases. I wish he would have delved even further into these cases. If you are silent and you really watch and listen, you can hear and feel that the people that investigate what most people want to pretend doesn't happen are incredibly caring human beings. Politics take nasty turns, and people pay the price. It's easy to minimise and vilify and point fingers, however, without people like this docuseries focuses on we'd be in a third world dictatorship, and we need to respect that. Sadly, all these good people are retired now, and there isn't anyone replacing them. Looking forward to the next part Homicide LA.",

People in North America all understand that New York in the 80s 90s was a completely different city going as far back as the Son of Sam murders and how proud law-enforcement was at their job. These are the cases that Mid-America never got to see they were just newsprint in New York City at the time when they happened. The nicest thing about this particular one is the honesty of the people involved, and the willingness to do their work, not for themselves for the families of the victims..\nBRAVO- they say there's 1 million more stories in the city I think we need to hear them.",

However, this is totally ruined by the fact that the wide screen shots are letter-boxed into a narrower aspect ratio. Why shoot with an anamorphic lens if you're just going to letterbox it later? That is totally absurd. Better would have been to release the series in 2.38:1 or 2.4:1 or 2.35:1 aspect ratio and letterbox the clips from narrower aspect ratio. Those clips have lower resolution anyway, so don't suffer from letterboxing.Instead, what we have is narrow aspect ratio clips occupying the full height of the screen with poor resolution, so we see a blurry picture. Then, when we see wide scenes with more modern equipment, it is letterboxed top and bottom, and if viewing on a widescreen device, also right and left. So both original low res clips and new higher res. Clips are shown in low res.Either they should have shot all scenes in 6:9 or they should have produced a final product in wide-screen.Unfortunately, the aspect ratio changes so frequently, the switch is very distracting.",

The stories are carried by the detectives and attorneys who lived the experiences and I found them to be extremely compelling.

Interesting murders, fascinating cases and your heart truly goes out to all the victims, loved ones and even the detectives affected by each case.As far as a true crime series goes, this is how it's done.So It's an anthology series that very cleverly goes backwards and forwards in time utilising a lot of the main detectives and law enforcement officers. I especially liked how they used the New York subway train graphic to show the timeline of events for each case.Detective's, prosecutors, the victims, the families, the trials. This show goes into intricate details with each case.Netflix we need a season 2 you could do another New York, a Boston, a Chicago. The thing that really shocked me was the production value with a lot of true crime documentaries sometimes its almost like watching a b movie. This was not the case at all with this show they did a fantastic job.I literally cannot fault this show. If you're a true crime fan, then like I said earlier this is how it's done. Again bravo to Netflix they hit a home run with this show all I can hope is we get many more seasons either still based in New York or many of the other American states.If this is made by the same people and the same production values go into every series I can see Netflix having a number 1 show on their hands with people clamouring for more.Chilling, disturbing, fascinating, jaw dropping, even frustrating at times you ride a whole rolercoaster of emotions with each case.

She does a really effective job of showing the anger and the devotion that she has to her new mission, her character was great in live action and it continues here.The latter 3 episodes focus on Barriss Offee who is once again voiced by Meredith Salenger. The show picks up after she was expelled from the Jedi Order in The Clone Wars. Salenger does a good job, we still see the inner turmoil of her character and that even though she was against the Jedi, she might not be fully on board with the Empire and it is just nice to get some follow up on her which people have been asking for years.Supporting Characters\nTo be honest this show is all about the two main characters and doesn't have too much time for the rest of the cast but everyone does a good job. Probably the main one is The Fourth Sister who has a good story with Barriss and gives some more character to this pretty dull character so that was good to see.It was also nice to see cameos from characters from the Star Wars universe such as General Grievous, Thrawn & The Grand Inquisitor. They all offer something to the stories and it was just nice to see them make a return here.Story\nThe stories are good. Seeing how Morgan Elsbeth went from surviving on Dathomir to become a Magistrate is well realised and it does set up future events in Ahsoka which is appreciated. I also enjoyed seeing Barriss journey to becoming an Inquisitor and how it showed her different viewpoints of the galaxy. But, there is no doubt that there is something missing here, it just isn't as interesting as I wanted it to be. Morgan's story doesn't do enough to tell us more stuff about her, it probably would have come across better if we had seen it before Ahsoka was released and we knew what happened to her. Barriss story does feel a little bit like missed potential and I think maybe they could have had 6 episodes just on that and it would have been better and the ending is incredibly abrupt and doesn't quite work like I think Disney thought it would.Script\nThe script is okay, this show is incredibly mature and dark and that does work and I am glad that this show goes with that tone and the lack of humour isn't an issue. The issue is that none of the drama really nails the mark fully, similar to the story I think Disney expected more and it just fell a bit flat at crucial times.Style\nThe animation looks fantastic. We have seen with other animated Star Wars shows that the animation has got better and better and this is up there with the best yet. The character models look fantastic and the action flows incredibly well and feels very smooth. But the pacing is where the issue is, with us only having 3 episodes each with these lesser known characters, plenty is left out and it feels a bit janky especially with Morgan Elsbeth which made it hard to really get invested in it.Overall\nOverall, Star Wars: Tales of The Empire is a good show that has some merit to it and will entertain fans of the franchise. But it doesn't hit the landing as much as it should and feels like a slight let down in that way but it is still a decent watch.Rating - 7\/10.",

This follow-up is... far less interesting and I'd hardly say The Mandalorian's Morgan Elsbeth and Clone Wars minor character Barriss Offee are of the same stature as Ahsoka and Dooku. Not only that but neither of them are particularly Empire-tastic. More... Empire adjacent. That being said, I still do like the shortness of the episodes, but it all feels very throwaway and more of an afterthought than a project in its own right or even a continuation of the first set of stories.",

Personally, I do not care much for Morgan Elsbeth as she doesn't really come off as an interesting character so I found the first 3 episodes to be relatively average, nothing insulting by any means but nothing that exciting either. The episodes focusing on Bariss Offee were more interesting to me as I like her more as a character but they weren't anything special. Overall there's a lot more they could've done with the show, but if you are interested in those characters then it might be worth a watch for you. Do not expect anything ground-breaking though.",

As a fan who watched this series alongside the disappointing \"The Acolyte,\" I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and storytelling prowess of this show. The intricate narratives, well-developed characters, and attention to detail in world-building truly set \"Tales of the Empire\" apart.The series manages to capture the essence of the Star Wars universe while offering a fresh perspective on the Empire's inner workings. Each episode delves into the lives of characters with complexity and nuance, making it easy to become emotionally invested in their journeys. The production quality is top-notch, with stunning visuals and captivating performances that transport viewers to a galaxy far, far away.After experiencing the lackluster storytelling of \"The Acolyte,\" \"Tales of the Empire\" was a breath of fresh air. It proves that there is still hope for meaningful and engaging content within the Star Wars franchise. I wholeheartedly recommend this series to any fan craving a more fulfilling and satisfying Star Wars experience.Here's to more content like \"Tales of the Empire\" that honors the legacy of Star Wars while pushing boundaries and exploring new horizons. May the Force continue to guide us on thrilling adventures through the galaxy!",

Not sure why TOTE wanted to showcase her backstory when we already know it.The issue with Morgan's three episode arc is that it doesn't tell us anything new about her and it doesn't make any sense.Morgan states to Thrawn that she \"seeks revenge,\" but revenge against who?? Grievous is dead, Dooku is dead, the CIS has been defeated-everyone responsible for the destruction of her people are dead. Sooo...what vengeance is she seeking? Morgan just becomes some corrupt bureaucrat for the imperials who basically turns a random village into a hard labor camp, but why though? Why is she going out her way to mistreat these people? We don't know. She just winds up running a pyramid scheme and then murders anyone who challenges it, and again, it's never understood why she's doing any of it outside of be generic \"I want power,\" which isn't a goal Morgan states. Again, she's somehow doing this to \"get revenge,\" one day against people who are already dead.So in the end, we wind up learning nothing new about Morgan and her episodes were largely a waste of time.I just stuck around for Barris, because we get to see what happened to her post RoTS. Barris' story does what Morgan's should had, which is sbowing us things we don't know, and exploring the depth of Barris herself. It was great seeing the Fourth Sister since we didn't get anything from her out of KENOBI. I won't go into detail about Barris' story because I'd be spoiling, but I do feel that it was better handled than Morgan's.",

The added edge here is this show being completely unafraid to go to some really dark territory. Star Wars hasn't been this dark since Revenge of the Sith and just like that film, hope is still present deep down.Diana Lee Inosanto's Morgan Elsbeth and Meredith Salenger's Barriss Offee were thinly sketched characters but thanks to just 30 minutes of screen time for each of them they've got so much more depth and both actors are given a lot to work with. Diana Lee charts a strong course through the journey of the dark side and Meredith Salenger brings a wise presence to the redemption of Barriss.The Clone Wars animation style only gets better with every new show that uses it. The level of detail in the environments is incredible and the character designs at this stage have none of the stilted nature that the show started off with. Kevin Kiner's score is amazing with a more mournful quality as the show spends almost all of its time in the bleakest parts of the Star Wars timeline.",

        "body":"1. Overall Plot - 6\/10\nThis is what hurts this series the most. Half the series is about Morgan Elsbeth. And Half is about Barris Offee. I just don't really care about the Morgan Elsbeth. She is boring and forgettable. The best part of her episodes is the Clone Wars stuff. But that is very brief.And I was excited to see what happened with Barris, but I don't really like what they did. It starts out great. But by the third episode I think they took it in the wrong direction. Her story just feels generic and overdone by now. I also wish we got to see more Darth Vader.2. Entertainment \/ Engagement - 9\/10\nThis was very entertaining to watch. They made the story with a boring character, very entertaining. And seeing what happened to Barris is cool. Seeing how the Empire created their inquisitors is super cool.The last episode is kind boring, as I don't like what they did with Barris.3. Emotion \/ Investment in Story - 10\/10\nThis has so much emotion. Morgan Elsbeth looses her entire race, and family pretty much. And Barris Offee is getting taught the opposite of everything she's believed in. It's super cool to see what this does to these characters.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 10\/10\nA big theme for this one is choices. We see how these characters make choices based off of their tragedies. It defines who their characters are. In Morgan's case it shows how she became the character that we've seen. And for Barris' case it shows what she did after embracing some darkness.5. Characters - 5\/10\nMorgan Elsbeth is just a character I don't care about. So seeing more of her story is just kind of boring. But seeing appearances like General Grevious is very cool. I do like how we see how she becomes a villain, and seeks out the Dark Side. Young Thrawn is also cool to see too.Barris Offee is a very interesting character. I think what they did with her character is dumb. They had it set up so good with her becoming an inquisitor. But how her character ended up developing and where she ends up is disappointing. It's overdone at this point. And makes no sense with what she had done in the past. I'm not a fan of the Barris story, and wish they did it differently. Especially the last of the three episodes.6. Acting \/ Writing - 9\/10\nAll of the voice acting is great. And bringing back other voice actors for characters like Grievous or Barris is what they needed to do, and did do.The writing is very good in the Morgan Elsbeth episodes. And for the Barris Offee episodes it is also very good. I just don't like the direction they took for the end of her story.7. Cinematography \/ Sets - 10\/10\nThis show is beautiful. Star Wars animation is getting better and better. I love how all the shots fit the feel of the episodes. They feel very scary and dark. I love how evil the Empire feels in the Barris episodes. Especially with Vader's presence.8. Score \/ Sound - 10\/10\nStar Wars music. The score helps make it feel evil, and definitely gives it a darker tone.9. Editing \/ Pace - 8\/10\nThis is an anthology. So the pacing is different every episode. They are all paced very well. I just wish the episodes were longer. Because of the shorter runtime, there is no filler. It is all great content.10. Animation - 10\/10\nThis is peak animation. I love it. It is animated beautifully. The fight scenes look very good, and are action packed. The animation does a phenomenal job at setting the tone of each episode.Average Score:\n8.7\/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:\n8.9\/10\nI want to love this and want to think it's peak Star Wars. But it just isn't. Don't get me wrong, it's still very good. It just had the potential to be even better. I would say I feel more disappointed after watching this. Because they has the opportunity to do something very cool with Barris, but instead did something usual, predictable, and boring.",

This automatically makes it hard for the series itself to set a high bar in the first place. However, I think it is worthy for what it offers. Since the series is about the Empire, I expected it to be dark - and dark it is! To be completely honest, I wish it was even darker, but it is of course a children's series, which I respect. The tales the series tells are good with a mostly predictable but well-executed plot that focuses mostly on inner conflicts that is a central theme in the Star Wars universe with an addition of action and drama. It is definitely worth checking out if you are a Star Wars fan, or at least enjoying the other computer-animated installments of Star Wars.Despite the absence of original characters, this series captures the grip of the dark side on the galaxy. Familiar plots are elevated by inner conflict and a child-friendly darkness, making it a good fit for Star Wars animation fans.",

It had a great and engaging first episode and progressed into a satisfying middle and end.Morgan's story started off great as well, especially with that amazing opening scene, but got increasingly less interesting as it went on and I thought the end to her story was quite lame and meaningless.Anyhow, I thought it was a good show, if you liked Tales of the Jedi, you'll probably enjoy this one too.",

I appreciate those two characters much more after watching this series. My favorite character besides those two was definitely the Fourth Sister and I hope we see what happens with her in the future. The one thing I wish we saw in the series was some sort of interaction between Darth Vader and Barriss Offee. That would've been interesting but I still definitely recommend if you are a fan of the empire or the dark side because this for me was a perfect example of short and sweet.",

        "body":"The series is basically a spin-off of to both the Clone Wars series and the Mandalorian\/Ahsoka series. The animation style follows what we get used to in Clone Wars, only it is even more detailed, even more beautiful.The title is a bit misleading since we will have little insight to the Empire's inner mechanisms, and the 2 main characters are not considered to be central players within the Empire. There will be some short cameos of important Empire characters, but that could happen in any series.Despite the average episode length is short, around only 15 minutes, it is usually enough to tell a whole story, sometimes even with a well-composed message.The season is divided equally between the 2 \"protagonists\". The first half is dedicated to Morgan Elsbeth, we can see her Dathomir witch origins, and I am especially glad that the first episode brings into live screen the conflict between Nightsisters and Grievous. In the latter two episodes we can see how she became the ruler whom we saw in season 2 of the Masndalorian. Honestly, maybe these 2 episodes are the least exciting in the series, with the exception of the cameo of a fan-favourite character, explaining the bond between Morgan and him.The second half of the series concentrate on Barriss Offee. With her plotline happened circa a decade ago in Clone Wars, she might be unfamiliar for some of the viewers. She was a padawan, who became a close friend to Ahsoka, but later betrayed her. Barriss, disillusioned with the Jedi Order, orchestrated the attack on the Jedi Temple, than blamed it on Ahsoka, - which ultimately led to Ahsoka's own disillusionment with the jedi, and caused her to leave the jedi order.Actually this half of the season was more interesting for me, and because Barriss had no established fate in the saga until now, the creators had completely free choice what to do with her. I would say they used this opportunity well and created a story worth to tell. Her character was made interesting enough, especially considering her past. I do hope this was not the last of Barriss.All-in-all, not being flawless, and obviously having constraints of a limited series, the Tales of the Empire does great job, and I definitely recommend it.",

The story unfolds at a sluggish pace, making it challenging to stay engaged throughout the journey. Moments that should be filled with tension or excitement often fall flat, leaving the player wanting more depth and intensity.Character development is another area that leaves much to be desired.

Vader was obviously dropped into one episode for literally 10 seconds just so they could put him in the trailer for the show to build hype. It almost felt like they made the show, realized it was boring and then added Vadder in to try and spruce it up a bit.Well the Bariss Ofee portion of the show was the best part really with again, a predictable outcome but at least it had interesteing characters and we had no idea what was going to happen next. 4\/10.",

        "body":"So far the animated shows have been the one thing that is always consistently high quality from Star Wars both pre-Disney and post-Disney but Tales of the Empire is just very lacklustre and extremely disappointingNot only did it fail to learn any lessons from Tales of the Jedi, it actually does more of what made Tales of the Jedi bad only none of what made Tales of the Jedi so epic and interestingI loved Tales of the Jedi despite its flaws and I was hoping Tales of the Empire would do just that but then from the evil perspective. But no we can't have that can we. It always has to be from the perspective of the good side. Evil characters turning good and turning the tide against evilI also don't quite get the point of the series. The plot was entirely lacking. Tales of the Jedi had clear defined purpose and plot to each and every episode and it told crucial backstory to major events and\/or characters or filled in gaps on characters where portions of their timelines haven't been told yetIn Tales of the Empire we get none of that. Most of what it tells us we already knew and the little new stuff it tells is just very boring and poorly executedJust as with all other Star Wars post-Disney, they are scared to take risks. We can't have a story that is just about a villain. It always has to be spun to be about the heroes overcoming the villains. Why can't we just have a villain story? If you are going to make something called Tales of the Empire then make it about literal Tales of the Empire. Not Tales of the heroes who defeated the Empire which is what this series is actually aboutPoor execution, low quality animation work (this is a step down from Rebels, Bad Batch and Tales of the Jedi), bad art style, poorly written story, 0 narrative\/dialogue and 0 new lore added to Star WarsEach episode is about 15 minutes long on average watching a single episode felt like an eternity and I really had to force myself to watch through the entire seriesAnd again this is a review by someone who loves all the Star Wars animations. I loved Clone Wars, I loved Rebels even more (Rebels is my all-time favourite Star Wars animation), I loved Bad Batch, I loved Tales of the Jedi. So the fact I just love all things Star Wars and all things animated and that I hate this series that is never a good sign.

Once in a while he even produces close to masterpieces and Ahsoka is still a great character, perhaps the greatest in all of Star Wars. But here there is nothing but nothing burgers with a side order of 'who cares'.Kinda cool getting some background story, and I always wondered what happened to Barriss, she had a great arc worth exploring. But since nothing of this really matters, and have no real impact on anything, I kept wondering; what is the point with this show? Where are we going with this? And the answer is; nowhere.The visuals are mostly great, music and sound design is as always with Star Wars, immaculate. But spending time with this? These characters? Why?And of course we now also gone completely overboard with pronouns. Half an episode I was completely confused, and had no idea what they were talking about, or how many They were...Jedi's are now as confused as a blue haired Kennedy alumn.What a shame.I hope they write Thrawn in a way that he actually wins.

I could not take my eyes off the screen. The animation and visuals are stunning - I love when the light sabers light up and the flying sequences are awesome.

The writing is so smart and funny. I think this movie will create a whole new generation of LEGO and Star Wars fans because it has something for everyone.This film teaches you to believe in yourself and to embrace teamwork.I give LEGO Star Wars: Rebuild The Galaxy 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 18, plus adults.

        "body":"First I have to say IGNORE THE HATERS!!! If you read the reviews so far they are about Gates himself NOT the series. People leaving reviews need to focus on why people read the reviews, and that's to find out if the series is any good or not. I can dislike a person with everything in me. But if they say \"putting your hand in the fire will burn you\" that doesn't mean they're wrong. I also wouldn't just instantly dismiss them either, as these 'hosts' pretty much are just the talking heads not the researchers, writer's, etc. Still with me? Alright, let's review the series now.The series itself is thought provoking and at times pretty insightful. That being said, it's nothing special to write home about but isn't terrible either. Honestly, it's a series touching on issues in a way that tries to be as middle of the road as possible. I believe the approach is to try not to alienate any one \"side\" of things. That being said, this is where it tends to loose out, instead of going all in the topics the series holds a lot back in their attempts to not upset anyone and not be political. While that in and of itself is a good thing in this day in age, it causes the series to not go far enough on the issues it's discussing.I'd say this is a good series to play in the background while doing something, and a better series to watch as you're settling in for the night. Engaging enough to keep you interested, but also not enough to overstimulate you or really draw your attention from other things.",

Put it simply, this man has done more for society than any other Billionaire in recent memory. The giving pledge is 100% proof of that. And I'll tell the naysayers to once again , believe in the actions, not the rumor and stop sitting in your rabbit hole and following your social media feeds and thinking you know something that no one else does. The list of this mans contributions to the WORLD would fill an encyclopedia and this documentary shows us a future that may not be as grim as people think. He shows us what the future could be by tackling issues like Global Warming, Disease, AI and extreme wealth. I came away feeling hopeful for our future after watching this. These episodes are the most important issues the future of mankind has to deal with and instead of bashing the man lets credit the FACT the he is thinking of them and more importantly DOING something about it and give credit where its due.",

So in short I don't have a lot in common with him other than our age.Nevertheless I pay attention. I know what his Foundation has been doing. I watched his Town Halls with Anderson Cooper during the pandemic. And we were fortunate to have him at that time. Many have forgotten how scary it was. The lonely, secluded deaths in the hospitals. The freezer truck morgues. The empty shelves at the grocery. The loneliness.It is really hard as you get old to keep an open mind and preserve your sense of curiosity. Doing those things can be exhausting.But Bill shows us precisely (and with no qualms as to how he appears) that it is good to be curious and to be open minded, even if it is hard and tiring. He is energetic in his pursuit of reality.It's good for us to think and to rethink. And then to think again.This series is for sure not what I expected. I did not expect Bill to interview people like James Cameron and Bernie Sanders. I was very much impressed and envious of his path. I'd love to sit in a room with Cameron and talk AI.I thought it was interesting watching him sit in a room and listen to entrepreneurs talk about AI. He took notes with paper and pen. The old fashion way and the way I truly believe is the best way: paper to pen to fingers to hand to arm to eyes to brain. I think that path sticks better than typing.Also, there really are no answers provided here. These episodes are meant to be thought provoking discussions. They are meant perhaps to move us forward on finding solutions.These solutions and life itself are fluid and changing (even if we don't like change). Bill is good at both adopting and adapting. It is how we will survive and maybe save our planet.As I mentioned I am exactly Bill's age. I am at the point in life where my medical issues are bringing my end closer and closer. I am glad we still have Bill. And that he's willing to put himself out there as he continues to learn and continues to be a force of good on this planet.",

Compare this to a David Attenborough program and you'll understand what I mean.Instead we seem to be invited to be a fly in the wall in a 'typical' day in the life of BG as he swans around meeting Uber wealthy people, conversing in language that's hardly common place, and almost laughing constantly whilst talking about serious topics. For example he brings up all the criticisms we know about like vaccines, land, etc, but doesn't really say much to elaborate on them.... so why not just say why he's buying up so much land, he'll not be around much longer in the bigger scheme of things so what's the philanthropic objective!To say it's all a bit weird is putting it mildly... it's creepy! This seems to be trying to a PR shot in the arm for Bill, the question is why should he be concerned about doing that..... he's amongst the wealthiest people on the planet and likes to be seen to be doing his philanthropic bit for humanity, but he doesn't need a public image to do that..... just get on with it silently!Hasn't helped Bill's image at all for me and I'm not much more informed about the subject matter than I was before watching this!",

That could have brought something interesting to the table. As it now stands, he seems like a very calm and comfortable, but quite boring, character who is a bit to eager to present himself as some sort of virtuous genius. This is not convincing.

That is where the greatest concentration of poor and right leaning live. Taxing the rich would ultimately reduce the tax burden on the poor, but the poor right are aligned with a party that defends the wealthy over all else. Poor communities are hit hardest by disease, but the poor right are generally where you find anti-vax conservative views. It's just blind loyalty to a party.

The writers, directors, editors, writers and the cast, were all brilliant, compelling, and entertaining. Serious kudos to all who made this happen. I am genuinely happy for Serhant's journey which I have watched since the early days of MDLNY. Of course, the City of New York itself is the real star of the show, as it always is. I don't remember the last time I binge-watched a series like this, it's more often than not that I will lose interest a couple of episodes in, or I will be busy doing other things while the TV is on kind of like a background noise. Not the case here, I was riveted from the first second to the last.",

        "body":"Ryan Serhant was my favorite from Million Dollar Listing New York, so I'm happy to see him back on the air with another real estate show. Real estate shows are the only reality TV I watch and I have to say, I really don't enjoy the bickering and drama parts of this or any other show. I always fast-forward through that BS. I just like seeing the actual homes and the deals get put together. I know we live in a society of lowest common denominator viewing, but seriously, how can anyone enjoy watching other people bicker? Plus, it's just so unrealistic. I have worked in a dozen different fields throughout the course of my adult life and adults in a professional setting just do not behave like that.You can probably already guess that the agents I like best are the ones who do their jobs, don't badmouth anybody else, and stay out of the drama. I felt so sorry for the one young guy with the tattoos. Here's what everyone with any life experience knows - the only people who expend energy putting others down are those who feel so bad about themselves that that's the only way they can build themselves up. It never makes the person being put down look bad, it only makes the person issuing the putdowns look petty and lacking in self-confidence. Hopefully that young man will learn that as he gets older.Overall, I like the show. I'll keep watching but hope that moving forward, they focus on the professional part of real estate sales and not the silly scripted nonsense.",

The series features larger-than-life personalities with egos so big they barely fit on the TV screen. Watching it, you can't help but feel that the people on the series look like paid actors carefully selected to cause unnecessary drama.The show's premise had potential, but the execution is lackluster at best. The contrived conflicts and over-the-top antics make it hard to take any of the real estate deals seriously. It's clear that the focus is more on creating sensational TV moments than providing any real insight into the world of Manhattan real estate.If you're looking for genuine entertainment or informative content about real estate, this show will likely leave you disappointed. \"Owning Manhattan\" is not as promising as it sounds.

        "body":"If you need any evidence that Ryan Serhant is likeable only in small doses, look no further than this Netflix series. Serhant sets the tone early on. His opening anecdote is that his grandfather once told him that cemeteries are full of wasted potential. This very odd introduction made me wonder what exactly Serhant was trying to tell us with this opening line. That he himself comes from a toxic family? That despite his massive financial success, he's only comfortable taking a shot at the dead, not the living who can still compete with him? Or that his perspective as a child was so warped by his family environment that it only stands to reason that he ended up choosing NYC real estate as a profession.As grandiose and blustery as Serhant is, the employees of his brokerage, even the elite brokers, are for the most part, vastly more sympathetic and relatable than he is. Most of the people who work for him seem like hard-working, ambitious people who just want success in a big way. I just wonder how in the good God they could stomach working for him. As a New Yorker who's watched this city transform radically and become less and less affordable each year, this series is only educational and does not whet my appetite one bit to learn more about the high-flying super wealthy. I look at this series and am happy to still be common and ordinary. I'll take that life over this frothing, preening circus. Recommended only if you need a good laugh.",

        "body":"I've watched Ryan Serhant in MDLNY since his very first season. Of all the stars of MD series he was the most relatable and the least annoying, while the other main guys including ones from the series in LA, often acted way too dramatic, arrogant and immature, cringy or uncomfortable to watch at times.But this series of SERHANT, Mr. Serhant's real estate agency, is disappointing. It's mostly about people-drama. It gives too much peak into the personal lives of agents that work for him. Like many reviews have already said, there isn't nearly enough footage of the actual properties and their settings to enjoy, or the deals being made or broken in the moment that the audience could anxiously watch and celebrate or cry for their outcomes.Also, the title - a little too loud of an ego scream. I get that they decided to call it \"Owning Manhattan\" with high hopes for the Serhant team to take over the real estate business of the island and beyond in the future. Still I find it a little too in-your-face and tasteless. This is reality TV which is well known for being scripted and edited whatever genre of reality TV, but it is still about real people that live in the real world, made of communities of real peole, so many of them struggling in this day and age. When the world has been turning upside down with more chaos than ever before, with people young or old, struggling and suffering more than ever... it shows a sense of disconnect to name this show what they decided to call it... a statement that a luxury real estate agency wants to own the most expensive island in the US.Through the years of seeing the Million Dollar Listing series, I learned that it is the egos and greed of agents and agencies that compete relentlessly with each other, that keep driving up the prices of homes, making those in popular cities less and less available for the middle-class all the while drastically worsening the issue of gentrification everywhere in recent years.That awareness today bothers me. This series is unapologetic about showing how the agents' seeming sole concern with setting the high records, making the big bucks, making it to the top of the lists of the most successful agents in magazines, elevating their social and financial status... it's all about them and themselves. With seemingly no awarenss of or perhaps denial about how their professional hunger games are most definitely contributing to even larger social class differences in the US, one of the biggest reasons why the country has become so troubled today - these agents seem to continue on focused on only their own successes and their own happiness, but not at all about the basic qualities of life or well-beings of others who are out of their sight.The shows gives a bitter taste and too much reality of just how self-centered and entitled these people that sell expensive real estate are, and how little to none they seem to care about the world outside of their little cliques, including Mr Serhant. It troubled me and I couldn't enjoy watching the series at all.No matter what beautiful clothes or accessories they wear, no matter how many homes they sell, if all they care about and talk about is money, record-breaking sales, connections with the big names, what fabulous vacations they had or lives they've got... even if they care about their closest loved ones, it makes them shallow, selfish, and frankly rather empty characters on the inside.If you show up on an international series and sell yourselves as a brand, why don't you show a little integrity and some good values with it, or at the very very least, don't advertise your endless, petty, catty fights for the whole world to see. They might get more clients and make even more money by advertising their brand this way, but the obvious immaturity, nastiness, and\/or low moral values of the agents of this agency must actually have an opposite effect on others with better judgements and drive them away.If any of them are donating even a fraction of their huge earnings to causes that help better the society, spending even one day out of a month doing volunteer work, making a choice to value community and real people over winnings and luxury... show it and I'll maybe change my mind about watching season 2. But so far, there is no sign of anything like that at all in this group of people that work for\/with Ryan Serhant. Let them be, but I'm not watching more of their vanity.By the way, in my life I've met some very wealthy, very successful people. Ones that leave an impression for decades later are always the those who were humble and never show-offs.Perhaps in the world of luxury real estate, it's not possible to nurture or maintain a humble character because you are selling what is basically the opposite of such value with the flashy properties and lifestyles.Watching the show made me wonder when these people get old if they'll feel truly happy in life, if they keep going the route they seem to be taking with their endless greed. It's a cliché but money and status really can't buy happiness. A beautiful wife\/husband or a picture-perfect family that comes with them can't either, if you lose sight of what really matters. Watching this show made me reflect on that once again, actually.Donald Trump may be an extreme example, but that real-estate-tycoon-turned-felon ex-president\/ super-controversial-current-republican-nominee... wasn't as bad when he was younger either, if people still remember. He was still just as cocky and full of himself whenever he appeared in media, but he wasn't as foul-mouthed or stupid with his words or actions as he became increasingly in his older age. The man has aged very poorly despite his millions or billions. It's like, look where his money, fame, and ego have taken him, and those who've surrounded him as well. No doubt in my mind his arrogance and greed has been his downfall and forever tarnished reputation.Perhaps the changes in today's world post-pandemic where people are more afraid, anxious, or losing a sense of hope for a future, some people maybe cling even more tightly to superficial successes that make them feel safe in the moment but not forever.Reality TV has been around since the MTV's Real World days in the 90s and grew into a huge money-making market. Just like the Internet and social media has had their positive impact to the world, until more and more negatives started to affect the society with our over-reliance on our devices, reality TV itself can be a positive tool for people to enjoy and learn about folks and the world that they may never know about otherwise.Million Dollar Listing series have done a decent job mixing the world of real estate with some human drama of agents, but not letting the latter ever outweigh the former. This show, on the contrary, has done the opposite.I will not be watching season two of this show if there will be one - unless they change the narrative and show us more homes and the better side of the agency and agents if there is such an side. In the meantime, I pray for the sake of these agents whose futures I hope won't be empty of real human values.",

        "body":"This documentary has to be viewed in the current climate that WWE & Netflix have a deal, & both have a shared interest in promoting Raw in 2025. So if you are a long-term wrestling fan, this disjointed documentary won't tell you anything new.It clearly started out life as a puff peice for WWE & Vince McMahon, who gets to talk a lot about himself while not really revealing anything much about himself. However, there are some unintentionally creepy moments in his interview that Netflix exploits to the full. The talking heads on the whole say positive things about McMahon, & even those who speak out against him feel like they've been specially selected by Vince, so that he can rebuke their comments & knock them down like skittles. Whether he does this successfully is up for debate.The documentary appears to have been shelved in 2022 when McMahon stepped down as CEO. You can almost feel the bitterness when Netflix puts up the caption that McMahon ceased all interviews at this time, leaving them high & dry. When WWE & Netflix brokered a deal for Raw, the finishing of this documentary must have been on the table as part of the deal, timed to promote the new partnership. Then the law suit happened, & what you are left with is a mess of a final episode.The last 15 years are glossed over, & if you don't know much about WWE, you are left thinking John Cena was the last big superstar. Roman Reigns is relegated to someone who just wanders around in the background & a few match clips. The second half of the episode covers the law suit, but here Netflix hands are tied. As the investigation & law suit are not concluded, & they are now linked to WWE they really can't say much. It's just a few rehashed news clips & screen shots of text messages briefly flashed on screen which leaves the last episode, & series on a whole, feeling like a disappointment. Perhaps McMahon sensed this & has spoken out about distancing himself from the project, & there's a story that he tried to buy it back to keep it from airing. This just sounds like Vince McMahon the showman\/the promoter, generating heat for the show to get people to watch it, & it worked. He's probably laughing behind the scenes, & reinforcing that he's still involved with the WWE product, without officially being involved.",

So I have to say I was probably looking forward to this more than just about anything that has been released on streaming in the last few years.Professional wrestling used to be so secretive, but now that McMahon has admitted the whole thing is more entertainment than a sport, many of the secrets have been revealed. I've seen some things over the last few years that have revealed some of it, and this documentary confirmed and revealed more for me.As for Vince McMahon, he is a very polarizing, complex man. Think along the lines of Bobby Knight, Donald Trump, Woody Hayes, or George Steinbrenner. So I'm not sure what to think about him as a person, but as a businessman, he is a genius to do what he did with the transformation of professional wrestling.Most documentaries on streamers are endless, and should be cut down. Conversely, this is only six episodes long. I think this could have easily been 10 episodes, and still would have been interesting.",

With what we're shown, most people are aware of the story of WWF\/WWE... however, it's still enjoyable, enlightening and captivating for all.I never binge watch TV, I don't have the mental capabilities to sit through six hours of TV, but on this occasion, I watched all six episodes straight, that's how good it is!I won't share any spoilers per se, however I will mention there are many legends appearing and guesting, having their say. The likes of Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, Hogan, Stone Cold, The Rock, Triple H all make appearances.I'd recommend it to anybody. My partner isn't a fan of pro-wrestling and she enjoyed it.. so, give it a go!",

        "body":"Don't expect a big beat up of Vince McMahon here. Being mostly filmed before the last damaging allegations, this is more a focus on Vince McMahons business mind - and how he swallowed the whole wrestling world under his ruthless ambition and business acumen.It's at its most interesting giving an insight into the workings of Vince McMahons mind, he reveals more than he needs to at times (including how he has sometimes said things to get ahead and sway\/program others as promotion), the other most interesting is the history of WWE. I learnt a lot although some WWE die-hards will prefer the Dark Side of the Ring.It doesn't shy away from the allegations, and is better for it. Bret Hart, Dave Meltzer and Eric Bischoff are great interviews. Vince is too reserved at times. He's a brilliant mind, and a brilliant villian, but potentially not a good guy. Time will tell so enjoy this documentary for what it is.",

        "body":"\"When we stop growing, we die\" is what McMahon said. It is ironic because the man has not grown emotionally since his adolescence. Paul Heyman, the voice of reason among the talking heads, said it best, that McMahon is overcompensating for the deprivation that he endured in the first 12 years of his life. He was abandoned by his biological father and severely abused by his stepfather, resulting in a core belief of defectiveness. Nothing he has ever achieved, no amount of success or adoration, will ever truly be enough to heal that inner child who still feels inadequate because daddy left him.It may be true that, without McMahon's voracious appetite to make something of himself, we would not have the behemoth that is the WWE. However, his true legacy lies in normalising domestic violence, fuelling misogyny and encouraging toxic masculinity in the storylines he conceived of to achieve ever higher ratings, including putting his own family drama on full display in his shows. What kind of person accuses his daughter of being selfish for not wanting her wedding televised on pay-per-view, and then arranges a wrestling match against him to humiliate her?Despite his insistence that Mr. McMahon is only a character, it is nevertheless one borne out of and embodying his unconscious desires, a medium through which he can express his true self with impunity. Mr. McMahon was his Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free card; \"Oh, I did something wrong? That was my character, not me\". He is not a role model to any man, not even his son, from whom he withheld affection and validation the same way that his own father did to him. This man lives in the fantasy that he does not perpetuate abuse in spite of his abusive childhood and clear evidence to the contrary. This documentary is one of abuse and the legacy of abuse, more than it is about wrestling, and it need not have been six hours long.",

        "body":"The first episode of Netflix's docuseries \"Mr. McMahon\" dives deep into the life and career of Vince McMahon, the controversial figure behind WWE. Directed by Chris Smith, known for his work on \"Tiger King,\" the series sets out to explore the rise and fall of McMahon, offering a comprehensive look at his impact on professional wrestling and the darker aspects of his legacy.The episode begins by establishing McMahon's early life and his initial foray into the wrestling business. It paints a picture of a man driven by ambition and a desire to transform the wrestling industry. Through interviews with McMahon himself, his family, and various WWE personalities, the episode provides a multifaceted view of his character. McMahon's charisma and business acumen are highlighted, but so are his ruthless tactics and controversial decisions.One of the standout elements of the episode is its use of archival footage and interviews. Smith has meticulously compiled over 100 hours of interviews, capturing candid moments with McMahon and those close to him. This footage is interwoven with clips from WWE's history, creating a narrative that is both engaging and informative. The episode does not shy away from the controversies that have surrounded McMahon, including allegations of sexual abuse and trafficking. These issues are addressed head-on, providing a stark contrast to the public persona McMahon has cultivated over the years.The episode also delves into the evolution of WWE under McMahon's leadership. It explores how he transformed the company from a regional promotion into a global entertainment powerhouse. Key moments, such as the creation of WrestleMania and the rise of iconic wrestlers like Hulk Hogan and The Rock, are covered in detail. The episode highlights McMahon's ability to innovate and adapt, but it also underscores the ethical compromises he made along the way.One of the most compelling aspects of the episode is its portrayal of McMahon as a complex and often contradictory figure. On one hand, he is shown as a visionary who revolutionized professional wrestling. On the other, he is depicted as a manipulative and morally ambiguous individual. This duality is captured through interviews with WWE insiders, journalists, and former wrestlers. Their testimonies provide a nuanced perspective on McMahon's legacy, revealing both admiration and resentment.The episode's pacing is well-executed, balancing historical context with personal anecdotes. It moves seamlessly between different time periods, offering a cohesive narrative that keeps viewers engaged. The editing is particularly noteworthy, as it juxtaposes McMahon's public statements with behind-the-scenes revelations. This technique effectively exposes the gap between his public image and the reality of his actions.However, the episode is not without its flaws. Some critics have pointed out that it does not delve deeply enough into the experiences of McMahon's victims. While the allegations against him are mentioned, the focus remains largely on his career and influence. This has led to some criticism that the series is too sympathetic towards McMahon, failing to fully hold him accountable for his actions.Despite these shortcomings, the first episode of \"Mr. McMahon\" is a compelling start to the series. It offers a detailed and balanced look at one of the most influential figures in professional wrestling. The episode succeeds in capturing the complexity of McMahon's character, providing viewers with a thought-provoking exploration of his legacy.In conclusion, the first episode of \"Mr. McMahon\" sets the stage for a gripping docuseries that promises to delve into the highs and lows of Vince McMahon's career. Through a combination of archival footage, interviews, and expert storytelling, it paints a vivid picture of a man who has left an indelible mark on the world of professional wrestling. Whether you are a wrestling fan or simply interested in the story of a controversial figure, this episode is a must-watch.",

Instead, this documentary is more-so a strained and plodding history of the WWE composed of: old footage, one-dimensional interviews and a surprising lack of input from Mr. McMahon, himself.It altogether feels like a documentary made by someone only vaguely interested in the subject matter, at hand, cynically hoping to exploit the attention of a devoted pre-existing fanbase. We live in something of a renaissance when it comes to wrestling documentary\/podcast output but when putting this alongside the like of A&E's biography series and Vice's 'Dark Side of the Ring' and 'Who Killed WCW?', this is, by far, the weakest of the bunch.If you want insight into the life and mind of Vince McMahon and his career at the helm of WWE, I strongly recommend looking elsewhere.",

While the documentary may be informative for those unfamiliar with the subject matter, for anyone with even a basic knowledge of McMahon or wrestling, it feels repetitive. Much of what is covered has already been explored in other documentaries, and if they had focused solely on new material, it could have easily been condensed into a single 90-minute feature instead of stretching it over six hour-long episodes.The documentary also feels more like a general history of WWE and professional wrestling than a focused examination of McMahon himself. Key aspects of his life, including the allegations of sexual misconduct, are only touched upon at a surface level, with no new or in-depth analysis. It rehashes familiar territory without offering any fresh insights.What's most disappointing is that the documentarians clearly set out to create something transformative, yet instead only manage to reiterate well-known information. The inclusion of a few voices we haven't heard from before does little to elevate the documentary, as many of the individuals chosen add little substance. In the end, it's a wasted opportunity, lacking both depth and originality.",

        "body":"I was curious being an old school 80's to early 2000's hardcore wrestling fan so I took a peek at this documentary on Netflix and it really stunned me. It was an amazing portrayal of the man behind the curtain in both good ways and bad, showcasing the start of Vince McMahon's rise to power and fame after he took over his father's business to his sheer and utter fumble and downfall with the plethora of sexual allegations and trafficking charges being filed against him. If you're a fan of wrestling, more so the glory days of wrestling, you'll definitely get a lot out of this too. There's a ton of flashbacks to many famous moments throughout the rise of the WWF, walking your thru the various eras from the golden age to the attitude eras and Monday Night Wars. And sure, maybe if you're like me watching a mogul in power use his power and wealth to get whatever they want may get you a wee bit mad, but you can use that anger constructively to further embed the fact that quite simply there's no reason to ever give any man like this the time of day when they clearly have no respect for you or anyone for that matter. Not even themselves. But do remember the good times during the 80s and 90s about the glory and golden age of wrestling and that the man was a damn fine storyteller and evil creative genius that managed to keep audiences invested for a very long time until all of his competition was defeated. But outside of that, he was cutthroat, arrogant, ruthless, savage and a downright despicable especially when it came to human decency and the treatment of women that will do whatever it takes to win no matter the cost. Even if it means sacrificing people's livelihoods, moralities and emotionally scarring them along the journey. One person who they interviewed said something that made 1000% sense about Vince as a person. He was only monogamous to one being in his entire life. And that thing was his business. And he didn't run that business. That business ran him. He was cursed by it. Plagued by its very existence. Whatever the business demanded he did. He could not sleep eat or function until the businesses hunger was satisfied which is almost never.",

I was a sickly, eccentric dork (still am, in truth) and I just found the machismo and hamfisted 'fakery' impossible to connect with - and if I'm honest, culturally, being a child, I found it a little bit scary. It crept into the playgrounds - I definitely took a few beatings from people imitating Stone Cold or The Undertaker, and as an active non-viewer of wrestling, those beatings and the merch everyone seemed to have were my entire frame of reference of WWE - and I deeply disliked it.I often felt like an outcast as a kid, and often got things wrong trying to 'fit in', but having now watched this fantastic series, it seems my adolescent instincts around WWE were right on the money.The extent of the sleaze and underhand tactics rife within wrestling normalised under McMahon's stewardship is simultaneously shocking and utterly unsurprising. The entire time, he was hiding in plain sight - and it's a damning indictment of the susceptibility of many people to manipulation and PR.The way it's told, however - it's sensational without being sensationalistic. It's articulate without being condescending, and insightful in a way which wouldn't have been possible had this documentary been released at the time of filming - and the extraordinary good fortune to get a lot of legitimate criticism of & striking candour from the pro-wrestling industry at large is both prescient and enthralling.Despite the relative deep dive, it still feels like just the tip of the iceberg - and I doubt we'll ever know the full extent of McMahon's malignance.

Not to mention Netflix basically just mention all the sexual harassments and rape accusations as more of a byline than actually getting into it.In the end it's just part story of the rise of the WWF but doesn't really tell you anything shocking or groundbreaking.Not really sure what the point of this series is because it certainly isn't to help the victims of the industry.",

The documentary does a great job of walking through WWE's evolution, giving new fans a real sense of the action, the characters, and the larger-than-life stories that make it so compelling.I don't think it portrays Vince McMahon in the negative light he seems to expect. Instead, he comes across as a unique, driven figure-a larger-than-life personality who truly loves what he does. The series is much more about WWE's history as a whole than just about McMahon himself, but he's undeniably the central figure, and his passion for the business shines through. And wow, does he say the word business a lot!There was a very touching moment in the final episode when Mr. McMahon and his son Shane shared an emotional exchange. Truly a beautiful moment between father and son. They have a unique, sometimes harsh relationship, but that's the old-school way. In many families, emotions aren't openly expressed-no \"I'm proud of you,\" no big displays of affection, just a look or a small gesture.McMahon said he was okay with his father never telling him he was proud, but he remembers so clearly the one time it actually happened. And when those rare moments do come, they're incredibly powerful. The documentary captured that beautifully.This is probably the best sports documentary Netflix has released since The Last Dance. McMahon is filled with insightful interviews, sharp editing, and a storyline that keeps things moving. Overall, it's a well-crafted piece, offering newcomers an engaging look into the world of WWE and its colorful, intense history.",

Now to be fair, there were some decisions that did work for WWE, but none of those things mattered because it is overshadowed by all of the dumb stuff he did. After watching this documentary series, I despise Vince McMahon more than anyone in the entire professional wrestling industry.

        "body":"Vince McMahon is one of the most complicated and fascinating individuals to ever exist on planet Earth--a statement that I promise is not an exaggeration. He created (and re-created, and re-created...) an empire the likes of which the professional wrestling business had ever seen. Yet, behind the scenes his personality is a psychologist's gold mine in terms of his egotism and complexity. Here in Mr. McMahon, director Chris Smith covers it all.In these six episodes, Vince's entire WWF\/WWE involvement is chronicled. It begins with him essentially buying out the business from his old man and turning it from a regional product to a national--then global--mega corporation. At its heights, the WWE was as popular as legitimate professional sports and was trading on Wall Street. Smith leaves no stone unturned in examining the history of Vince's WWE tenure, and that history alone would be enough to classify Mr. McMahon as \"solid\" in and of itself.But this isn't a history lesson at its core. No, it is a character study on Vince himself. The genius of that approach here is that McMahon is enough of an egotist that no guessing is required to figure out what he's thinking. He has no filters about saying exactly what makes him tick directly into the camera. A man--for better or for worse--who has absolutely zero feel for how he is perceived. Which, again, works perfectly for the documentary format because little guesswork is necessary.Even with McMahon's involvement, however, the filmmakers certainly don't shy away from Vince's seedier sides. His various legal\/personal scandals are well-recounted, as are his shady business practices (e.g. The Montreal Screwjob) and almost compulsion to forsake any semblance of morality or character in service to business or financial needs. He is perhaps the best--and worst--of capitalism in living, breathing form.Is this a fair examining of Vince McMahon? I'll say yes. To me, any damning material in Mr. McMahon comes \"straight from the horse's mouth\", so to speak. Time after time, the documentarians ask Vince to explain himself or provide context, and time after time he professes no regret for even his seediest actions. There is no outside slander necessary.Overall, considering the history and personality aspects to Mr. McMahon, I can easily give it the pinnacle of 10\/10 stars. Hard-core wrestling fans will love it for completely different reasons than the \"uninitiated\" as it is so good at weaving all its threads together. This is documentary work of the highest order.",

But the business, the entertainment of wrestling is more real than any other sport, that was my impression watching it anywise.

I kind of liked Mr McMahon because he is just so transparent with how he made decisions, his ruthlessness and anything goes if it could win ratings. It was an eye opener that sometimes the audience led the script, like they'd quickly adapt characters to fit in with audience responses. That's amazing. That's real.People have critiqued the show as being a puff piece where and I suppose it's true.... But does it matter? I mean you still get a pretty rounded picture of the man. Whilst he is similar to Trump and Musk in that he's a larger than life character who loves being centre of attention, he is different to them in that he doesn't claim to be a genius or even the smartest guy in the room, he merely claims to be good at running a wrestling business and everything is about that.

        "body":"I was a huge fan of the WWF in the nineties. It was part of every fiber in my body. I grew, drifted away from the show until my twenties and then revisited and re-joined in the early 2000's. Doesn't understand why some of the gimmicks changed and how come some of the wrestlers are still performing. How can it be?As a young adult, people kept asking me why the hell do I watch it, and I immediately answered that this is my soap opera and this is my little guilty pleasure, that got three nights of my life, in one week. I was addicted, reading and writing columns about it on small blogs and left once again after got married.Since, I no longer watch, as my favorite wrestlers have been retired or died and now I am sitting quietly and waiting for the right time to introduce this world to my kids. For now, it is only right not to let them be acquainted with it, but the day will come, very soon, where I will be a part of this world once again and this time, with the next generation of my family.So...after this personal introduction, a little bit about the six episodes of Mr. McMahon... he had a rough childhood, he clawed his way from the bottom and became what he is in his two bare hands and he created the WWE to be what it is today. All of those, for almost five episodes of the series were full with sweet and sour memories.Some of the memories were shocking and some were familiar. Some of the details were new to me, personally, and some of the details were new or elaborated, comparably to the ones I knew. It was a fantastic blast to the past, of the days we were all imitating the behavior of the wrestlers.It reminded me the evolution this business went through the years and especially the men that pushed it to be the way it is. And there I was, wondering about how to embrace this kind of culture or cult, that is...once again, led by a narcissistic maniac that will do everything to protect his business and also do everything that he will think that will sell to the audience.I had my fair share with this company and finally I was to old and with little time to invest, but there were always those internal feelings about the comparison between the business and nostalgia. This is the way Vince McMahon will be finally judged. A genius mastermind that got it his way, but in the end of it, we all hope he will really get what he deserves.",

But then the series took a turn, due to the legal development while it was filmed. Vince McMahon couldn't keep the last interviews and it became a little like Tiger King.During the series everybody points out that in the Attitude Era reality and characters got mixed and this is, what happens to the series when reality was faster than the development of the series.On a meta-level the series mixes reality and fiction but also lets someone pointvout at zhe end that Vince McMahon is not as one-dimendional as we might think or the series presents him.I loved watching it.",

We went to multiple WWF events, regularly watched on Monday nights, and we really enjoyed it as a family... and still do. Now when it comes to Mr. McMahon, he's an entertainment genius.What comes with the genius behind the rarity of people who are able to accomplish what he did, controversy! It's not just in wrestling, it's in entertainment as a whole. Whether it's sports, pop culture, movies, reality tv, etc. There is always controversy! Why do we follow these controversies? Because it's entertaining!Whatever the industry is that we chose to follow, we are likely doing it because that is what entertains us.Was Vince accused of some horrible things, yes. Did he do these horrible things, possibly. But did he entertain us, definitely!The show must go on.",

We all tried to mimic the signature moves of the stars at home, one way or another.However, this series is a real eye-opener, exposing the darker side behind all the glamour. As someone who grew up with this entertainment, I was completely disgusted by what was revealed.It seems that someone who has had an abusive and traumatic childhood can grow up to be a monster, lashing out at others in any way possible.

Most of it has already been covered extensively by a bunch of YouTubers, VICE TV's Dark Side of the Ring, A&E documentaries, whatever the WWE publishes on Peacock, and so on.The six-episode series is more of a retelling of the history of the WWE, and as such, a full-fledged spotlight is never put on Vince McMahon (or Mr. McMahon his on-screen persona). Of course, since he's been the one pulling all the strings from behind the curtains, the story naturally tends to revolve around him. Also, since most of the content here is nearly 2-3 years old, and major developments have taken place since then, a large chunk of it feels like a placeholder.I liked getting to know 5% more about the equation between Shane and Vinne Mac; that was honestly the most interesting part for me. The rest, the allegations included, didn't offer any new insights.

Its clever how the storylines some of which i didn't know about as I got older and i stopped watching may or may not have reflected Vince in real life especially with all the current investigations and headlines. You can see the high level of respect most wrestlers held of him but the one thing I thought was weird about it was that they never considered approaching some of the main match commentators who surely knew Vince very well professionally and personally like Jerry \"The King\" Lawler or JR or Michael Cole. That would definitely have added more value to the documentary and of course like others have said most of it was recorded before the most recent allegations so don't expect it to focus on that solely.

But before I go into the show itself, let me make clear, that if you are here, because you heard of all the accusations and you are expecting the show to lay that bare ... well that will not exactly happen. Too much is in the open - too much is still discovered and investigated ... what the show will do though: lay out who McMahon is, how he grew up and how people perceive him. There are quite a few moments that are more than ... let's call them revealing.One of them being where he almost self reflects too: when he blames Ted Turner for doing exactly what he did ... and where he gives us the nugget of what he believes and what he makes public being two different things sometimes ... well you may have guessed that anyway - but it is here to be seen.But let's backtrack - I always had the impression that he had it easy. I knew his father was a promoter and that he .... well \"Inherited\" the business . Looks like I was wrong on both counts. More on the first than the second - still he did not just get the business handed to him. Character building some might call it - he also only got to know his father when he was a teen ... he lived in trailer parks before with other people ... why? Well they never talked about it and I imagine if the filmmakers had found out more, they would have shared.So he took over and he changed the wrestling world - well first the map .... literally! I am not going to retell every little thing that happens here (in the docu series\/show) ... I can tell you that I got curious for more things ... or more people ... you almost need documentaries for some of the players (no pun intended) ... like Hogan .. or Benoit! Yes he is mentioned too - and I think there is a documentary coming. Even McMahon talks about him ... I haven't checked lately, but they had deleted him ... as if he never existed in the WWE ... that does not mean I think what he did (murder suicide) ... obviously this was more than horrible on so many levels. But as you can see here and it is being undisputed ... he got brain damage.Which by the way is the reason why chair shots got banned .. so while the show will .. show us many dark and evil sides to McMahon (Vince) ... not everything is black and white ... you have someone who until the end is telling us how great he thinks he is ... because he helped him and his wife.Many things are known, but still it is always great hearing about them (like the Screwjob\/Bret Hart) ... so while it may not entirely fulfill what some (many?) may have expected ... with all the stuff happening around him ... that we get more of the women and the allegations ... the show tried to fit in as much as possible (no pun or innuendo intended) ... mostly in the last episode. Which was hard enough considering Mr. McMahon himself did not do his last scheduled interview ... instead he tried to buy the whole show ... to probably bury it. Not to mention him going on his socials and \"warning\" that the show probably would be biased against him ... things being taken out of context.I would say he felt and thought wrong - the show let's him speak - this is one ... messed up family for sure ... the way he did storylines ... blurring reality and fiction ... well crazy would only scratch the surface ... watch at your own peril of sorts.",

        "body":"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulIn 2024, Vince McMahon stepped down as chairman of WF wrestling federation, in light of ongoing allegations of sexual misconduct during his reign at the organisation. In a series of interviews filmed in 2021, he charts his rise to the top, from humble beginnings growing up in poverty, before his dad, who'd made a name for himself promoting wrestling, came back into his life, and he took over after his death. From there, a series of scandals emerged, involving steroid abuse, sexual assault, and McMahon's own turning point into the 'Mr. McMahon' character that everyone loved to hate, after his treatment of Bret Hart after his match against Shawn Michaels.The whole wrestling phenomenon, with its overblown grandiosity, and the obviously staged nature of the stunts, with their scripted dialogue, is something that has never appealed to me. But that doesn't mean I can deny its massive appeal and the huge success it has generated among many loyal fans, and the man most responsible for that would appear to be one Vincent McMahon, \"the P. T. Barnum of wrestling\", as he's referred to at one point.Sat in front of a camera with the lights on him, McMahon seems relatively reserved and mild mannered, but he's clearly capable of being a driving force and spurring things into action, as it's documented how he took wrestling from something watched by some drunk, older guys in a beer hall, to a big time event watched by millions in stadiums. As he's rumoured to have said, \"...the WF isn't about wrestling, it's about entertainment.\" This was all before his rival, in the form of WCW, came along modernising things, and forming a level playing field with competition.With such a dark cloud hanging over his head, inevitably you feel uneasy recognising McMahon's legendary status, but this six part documentary is in itself an interesting and illuminating account of his role in making wrestling what it is today. ****",

The scandals are skated over so quickly you don't even get any details about allegations and settlement terms, and anything controversial is tamped down by some hollow justification. It's especially gross to see some of their most offensive moments revisited...with the exact same tone they were initially presented. So they learned nothing? Maybe some of the supporting players will add some flat notation about it being \"a different time\" but again, ignoring known truths instead of addressing them makes for a boring documentary. The talking heads are also there simply to support the chosen hero narrative - don't expect to see any critical examination by experts and analysts, outside of a lone reporter. This wouldn't really matter, except this actually is a juicy story. Even as propaganda, it's still interesting - but having someone on hand to actually address the sociological impact of its most toxic eras, and the excitement and energy of its best ones, would have made it more memorable.

You get just very little information about Vince and even this you already know about him. Yes there are some \"uncomfortable topics\" like the ring boys or Chris Benoit but all of em seem really superficial and again you don't get anything you didn't know already.All in All the series itself is made well of a production standpoint but nothing near what people really wanted or expected - no surprise really cause Netflix doesn't want to fight with someone who they're in bed with.

Vince McMahon had ruined many careers and lives in a much more ruthless way than this portrays. Barely talked about Owen Hart, but a different series goes into detail about Vince's involvement in his death. That series is much better with details related to wrestling. I was hoping this would be similar to that series, but it's just fluff. It seems like Vince is making his own biopic with talking heads that are most favorable to him. It's a nice history lesson, but don't expect much dirt to be exposed. I felt it was missing so much substance, which honestly may just be the reflection of the subject matter.

Are ww just trying to be edgy by talking about that time this athlete got caught saying a bad word back in the day?

They have no knowledge on what it takes for a man to build something up from the ground up. So they jump to believe any lies coming from people who are looking for some quick cash and clearly fabricated evidence.I was enjoying this documentary in the aspect where seeing how McMahon built his business from nothing, having a hard past, and seeing Taker and Michaels on here. (Can't say the same to the beta makes who make these kinds of documentaries while having a silver spoon given to them their wholes lives). But then you guys put on CNN and Wall Street Journalist on your show. Which made the whole documentary even a greater exposure to how fake and pathetic of an attempt to discredit the McMahons. The WWE has given the public far better story telling than your fake news CNN and Wall Street journal Cucks combined.I wouldn't recommend anyone who can tell fact from fiction to watch this documentary.

        "body":"Overall, a pretty good account of the rise of Hitler and the reign of terror perpetrated by the Third Reich. I've watched a number of similar documentaries about Hitler and this one showed me a few things I had never known.The documentary is certainly taken down a peg by the atrocious casting of Károly Kozma as Hitler. When it comes to physical likeness, on a scale of 10 Kozma is about a 6. The casting department could have chosen from hundreds of capable actors with much more similar physical characteristics. Kozma's poor likeness to Hitler is one thing, but his abysmal performance amounts to little more than scenes of hysteria - usually unwarranted - giving Hitler very little depth. Kosta's scenes are all pantomimed (there are no speaking parts) and most of them are poorly executed. To say the least, this was a critical role and they made an awful choice by going with Kosta. You also have to blame director Joe Berlinger for encouraging Kosta's ridiculous style of performance.There are other things that are seemingly glossed over, including Hitler's terrible health and booming drug dependency. Hitler was prescribed over 90 medications through his life, suffered from numerous serious ailments, and regularly consumed amphetamines, barbiturates, opiates, and cocaine. Between his very poor health and easy access to drugs, little wonder that Hitler devolved into the madman that he surely was.There's also short shrift given to Hitler's pact with Japan, the courage of the British military, and various other facets of World War II. But, after all, I still did award the documentary a 7 out of 10, indicating I did find it very watchable and illuminating. It shouldn't be the ONLY documentary you watch about Hitler, but it certainly belongs in the upper echelon.",

While this documentary drew on William Shirer's written materials and broadcasts it fell short in several areas.Having lived and worked in the former Soviet Union as well as the former Soviet Bloc countries, it infuriates me to see how western historians gloss over the complicity of Stalin, Molotov and Beria for their part in starting WWII. While some mention was made to the Soviet invasion of Poland and the subsequent annexation of the eastern half. There was no time spent on the Soviet invasion of Finland and the Baltics. There was no mention of the vast amount of material aid provided to the Nazi regime by Stalin. Despite Poland's invasion by both Germany and the USSR, there was no mention of why the UK and France declared war on Germany but failed to declare war on the USSR.A brief aside during the Nuremberg trials about the fact that the Soviets committed many of the same \"crimes against peace \" but were not only never \"put in the dock\" but were allowed to judge and then allowed to enslave all of eastern Europe despite agreements to allow free elections.No mention of the fact that Stalin was responsible for the deaths of at least ten million civilians, that Molotov's signature was alongside Ribentroff's assuring the start of the war and finally not a word on the Soviet \"concentration camps\" (gulags) where civilians were starved, beaten and shot to death in the millions or the many Soviet public works projects constructed with forced labor.One last comment, the comparison of Hitler's retreat to Mar a Lago was unnecessary and stain on the great historical work by Shirer.",

I guess, because no one wants to talk about the American money that funded them. Henry Ford, the Dulles brothers etc. There was a great deal of support amongst American money to bring them to power. This is well documented but not discussed in these things because it puts America into a bad light.

It would really be strong if important historical documentaries stuck with a solid single narrator (Peter Coyote\/ Martin Sheen) & not a constant trope of random academics who provide their two sense as if they were first-hand witnesses.Most of all, documentaties like this need to get rid of the constant 10 second frames of random individual men\/ women in a semi-darkened room speaking when they can just continue with the interesting footage or re-enactments that they already have. This doc series has plenty of unique footage & decent reenactments but is ruined by the consistent random guy\/ gal sitting legs crossed with a red curtain behind them.The tones of the voices from the speakers are a bit whiny\/ annoying & there does seem to be many personal opinions given without the speakers stating that what they were saying was actually an opinion. If I watch again I would write them down but I likely will not watch again. If I do I will worth the watch with closed captioning on & volume muted.Lastly, I understand WW2 & Hitler covers tons and tons of information, but it is hard to understand how large events kinda just get muttered but then they fixate on smaller events & really blow them up.

However I now start to actually engage and get interested in that horrible period of our history to learn more.So I'll just go with the pros and cons of this mini series.The pros:Whatever method they used to do cleverly colourise the old footage is remarkable, it's truly amazing and does really break down the disconnect you get from black and white.The variety of different nationality commentators is also really nice to give slightly different perspectives.I really enjoyed the approach of looking at it from the common Germans persons perspective, and what they saw and thought, how they voted etc. It was refreshing to hear that they weren't all somehow complicit, and how ultimately they were slowly strongarmed into saying nothing.The cons:This is clearly politically driven. I'm not sure how many times they said 'make Germany great again', but it was enough times to make me, a Brit, think \"wow, that's a bit on the nose\". I've no dog in that race but I found that a very thoughtlessly glib comparison to make regardless of what side youre on. So it lost a whole lot of intellectual integrity for me.The dramatisations are actually awful, and totally un-needed. A lot of the time the dramatisations of the trials are still voiced by the criminal, but slow mo reenactments, even when there are actual videos? It makes no sense. Still pictures would have been better if the reel was damaged. It cheapens it, and cheapening this when diving into the holocaust is just distasteful.I guess this one is a bit 50\/50 if you'd like it or not.

The pace is okay, not too fast, not too slow, just good enough for us to understand and keep up with the story. Some scenes are new, acted, but it's not a problem, it does not take you out of the experience. Overall a great docuseries. Good job Netflix 👏",

        "body":"There are many war documentaries, and this one integrates notable technology in all the information that support the Nuremberg trials. The perspective is narrated from the American journalist William L. Shirer, who lived in the Germany that embraced Nazism, including reflections, opinions, and historical episodes in first person. The story tries to be arbitrary, but insists a fundamentally American perspective, with several nods to Trump's demagogue speech or racial discrimination problems. There is allusion to lesser-known episodes, such as Hitler's visit to Compiègne, the severe rape of German women at the end of the war or the massacre of Jews in Kyiv. Clearly, the director's intention is to raise awareness about the dangers in failing to democracy, so the documentary is mostly easy to digest. Personally, it seems to me that the vision between good and evil is quite basic, pondering between the sense of justice to justify some purpose. I think the documentary loses points there. In any case, it is a good opportunity to look at the impeccable timeline that brought Hitler to power and review his alarming strategy from beginning to end.",

Old film is colorized and very impressively done. There is criticism of the casting of Hitler for reenactment scenes. No he's not the best but if you were an actor would you respond to a casting call to be Hitler? Especially for a low paid gig of a documentary? I know I wouldn't. So they worked with who they got. His lack of physical resemblance to Hitler is irrelevant in my opinion.This documentary also went deeply into all of the trials and the background for each trial that warranted the charges.This documentary has much information that is new for me. It compliments the other documentary films I have watched and contains some very difficult scenes that show the ruthlessness of the nazi army. It also shows how they became that way, and how many had to make a choice to save their own lives.All in all very well done and kept my interest easily. Not easy to do with a multi hour documentary. 9 out of 10 for that and the editing, explaining and colorization.",

The trial itself is not at all the focus of the documentary. Instead the documentary is really just another rise and fall of Nazi Germany. While this is useful historical knowledge , not much of it is new information. However some of the in colour footage that is shown I hadn't witnesssed before. The Himmler scene watching the shootings is extremely startling , but a necessary reminder of how warped human beings can become.In terms of the trial I have found other sources to provide more information. There are of course some very interesting direct recordings, but I would have really liked to have heard more from people's feedback from the trial who were there other than just Shirer. It would have been very interesting to see them go through each of the defendants and shown what they did during the War. They do this in part, but it isn't very organized as each defendant is mixed into essentially the docs retelling of World War 2.Overall the documentary doesn't do injustice in any way to the topic, it's just not delivering on the trial aspect as much as I was hoping.",

        "body":"Hitler presided over possibly the largest cult in human history, numbering the populations of Germany and Austria. He was a malignant narcissist, like most infamous cult leaders like Jim Jones, whose unwavering grandiosity helped sway the German population, who felt isolated and were looking for relief from their overwhelming post-WWI uncertainty and austerity, into his spell.A malignant narcissist is so named because of their nihilism and perverse appetite for destruction. Like all narcissists, they rely on external validation to create an identity and sense of worth. Malignant narcissists are the most extreme in the sense that they will stop at nothing to achieve and maintain that tenuous identity they have created; there is no morality and no empathy. Without that identity, they are nothing and hence nothing else matters.Like any plane crash, a series of unfortunate events have to occur to precipitate total catastrophe. The first in the case of WWII was Hitler's failed attempt to be an artist. No doubt he blamed the art world for not recognising his brilliance. His \"woe is me\" and underdog persona endeared him to many Germans, including his Nazi henchmen, who felt hard done by following what they perceived as unjust treatment for Germany's role in WWI. Combined with his absolute certainty in himself and Aryan superiority, it proved an intoxicating salve to the impoverished German masses.I am no historian and am unqualified to comment on the veracity of the content of this docuseries. What I appreciate about it is that it gave me a glimpse into the mind of Hitler and how it is plausible that such horrific events can happen again, because people remain too susceptible to the empty promises and false narratives wielded by mentally-unstable and self-serving leaders like Hitler. 20 million dead in Europe in WWII because Adolf had a bad childhood and people are still not good at identifying malignant narcissists, let alone mounting a defense against their fake charm.",

        "body":"Hitler and the Nazis: Evil on TrialJust in time for the 80th anniversary of D Day, Hitler and the Nazis: Evil on Trial is a 6 episode miniseries documentary going through the obvious subject matter. Each episode is an hour, so it's a pretty in depth peek of the despot, and the really really stupid people that both followed him, and allowed him to do what he did to the world.The series is divided into standard documentary style history lecturing and archival footage from the Nuremberg trials after the war had ended. Since most of the world remembers, knows, or has family who experienced the tragedy and genocide, there isn't much here that isn't already known.The thing I question is the motive of the filmmakers. This clearly is a parallel propaganda movie to what is going on in America today, without the genocide. Over half of the documentary speaks of a country that is in denial about losing, listens to someone who sympathizes with the fallacy, and then trumpets around how great their country has become, all while committing atrocious acts of violence. Gee, sound familiar?The filmmakers are definitely not wrong, but I don't see the point. The people who really need a wake up call won't hear it, or are too stupid to understand the comparisons. These things never work because people have already made up their minds no matter how many facts they choose to ignore. Even Hitler went to prison after a court found him guilty, years before the damage he wrought. Heaven help us if that happens again.It's worth a watch if you know nothing about the details of the Germany that ruined the world, and then got the beat down it deserved.

In the final analysis, Hitler cared not one iota about his country's citizens, only his conquest of territory and warped thinking of Aryan ancestry.

Yes, we know Hitler was evil and the viewer most likely (and hopefully) is somewhat aware of the atrocities committed. That's the reason they bought into the series. But to be so blatant and ignorant as to - whenever the chance presents itself - belittle the man and the regime with aggressive, condescending, demeaning \"hot takes\" really takes away the nuance and complexities that the series was trying to build up from the beginning. That's what the audience wants to see Netflix, they want perspective, they want a story, footage and facts. They do NOT want someone name-calling Hitler and his comrades any opportunity they get.

Overall I thought it hit the highlights from Hitler's youth to gaining power to the Fuher was expected. The content however was lacking depth, jumped around timelines and made for a broken and disjointed linear history of the largest war ever seen. Willian Shirer's views were nice to have but again so superficial - better to read the book William L. Shirer: Twentieth Century Journey.The historians, disappointingly, were less than stellar. I counted 5 times I heard the \"Make Germany Great Again\" in the first 2 episodes - a clear political jab of current events and not history and then again in a later episode, when introducing Hitler's \"Wolfs Lair\" being described as \"Hitler's Mara-La-Go\".

Hitler saved such performances for his speeches in front of masses of people. He wasn't going nuts all the time. From footage I've seen he actually seemed quite calm and charming in more intimate settings which I find quite telling and even more disturbing somehow, because I see the parallel in Trump. During his speeches he is unhinged but privately many say he is very charming and well mannered. Anyway I just found the performance of whoever played Hitler to be very unrealistic and just annoying. There was a film about Hitler a few years back called Downfall where Hitler was played superbly I think by Bruno Ganz. I wish they hired him for this.",

A thing like Babij Jar which normal generations automatically has known about since elementary school by reading history books, is instead reenacted in a 5 minute b-movie-like scene here for the generations who no longer read books or who no longer can listen to a witness or survivor without a fidger spinner in their hand. Not all but some of the younger (and mostly US american) historians interviewed here says things like \"and I can't understand why they did this!\" (about the Holocaust). I say if you are a historian and do not - then it is about time to read a book instead...\nThe positive part I can say about this documentary is the Nürnberg parts, as it brings up some few details not known before. But that's it. The rest of the of the documentary is about things that one should learn about in books by educated historians and which is so basic for humanity and sadly here treated like a b-movie tv-production reenactment.If you want a serious documentary, watch Shoah, or Hotel Terminus, or Night and Fog, and so on.

        "body":"Making a Film, a Drama or a Documentary recreating history in the form of drama or narrating something of the past needs great dedication. It requires extensive study and analysis of all aspects relevant to this. Successive films have been made on Adolf Hitler; the mysterious man. The Documentary Hitler and the Nazis: Evil on Trial released in 2024 is another effort. But Hitler and the Nazis: Evil on Trial is a documentary having enactment of some events.As a documentary Hitler and the Nazis: Evil on Trial consisting of 6 episodes; Origin of Evil, The Third Reich Rises, Hitler in Power, The Road to Ruin, Crimes against Humanity and The Reckoning tries to shed light on several aspects of life of Hitler and the NAZI party. Scholars like Francine Hirsch; Professor of History with specialization on Russian and European affairs at University of Wisconsin-Madison, Devin Pendas; Professor of History at Boston College, Alexander Richie; author of Warsaw 1944, , Benjamin Carter Hett; author of the Death of Democracy, Richard J. Evans Author of The Coming of the Third Reich, Christian Goeschel; an author of several Books on Hitler, and such others express their opinion on Hitler.The series refers to the account of a Journalist who came to Germany in 1934 to cover the event of annual meet NAZI. He has stated that he had been there for six years. However, the Documentary began with a trial conducted jointly by Britain, USA, France and Russia. The trial was going on against the captured and surrendered NAZI leaders after the death of Hitler. Significantly, there was no representation from Germany to participate in the trial process except the NAZI leaders. This in some form or other reminds The Treaty of Versailles signed on June 28, 1919 which sealed the destiny of Germany and compelled Berlin to run the country at the behest of winning axis.But the Documentary starts with an intentional approach of defaming Hitler. No commentator appreciated Hitler's talent. Remarks like \"not a good student\" \" not a good painter\", frustrated individual because of troubled past, reference to Hitler's parents, Hitler coming to Germany from Austria with fake identity, role played by Hitler as German soldier during First World War and others. Károly Kozma played the role of Adolf Hitler. The documentary shows Hitler becoming a politician from an army accidentally while arguing against someone in a Restaurant.No doubt, this is a documentary. But it follows same approach; blaming Hitler for everything, calling Hitler war-monger, blood thirsty and enemy of humanity. This is surprising that all the commentators remained silent throughout hours-long discussion about USA, Britain and France. One of them of course says that World War-2 took place from the ashes of Treaty of Versailles. But as far as devastation caused by USA in Japan and Russia making worst human rights violation after entering into Germany, there has virtually been no statement. To prove Hitler an evil, they dismissed the ideas like Hitler's patriotism, German nationalism and others that may change the narrative. But the commentators admitted Hitler's oratory skill but portrayal of Hitler's speech shows mere insanity and hollow emotions to prove his point during his public speech.But all these are not unexpected. This has been the saga for decades. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that after so many decades, Hitler is relevant and occupies a significant place in the arena of art particularly movie, drama, or documentary which is certainly exceptional. This Documentary also proves that there is an unusual attraction and immense curiosity about Adolf Hitler. There have always been dictators and the saga of conflict is nothing new. But one thing is true that Hitler lived as a king and courted death as a king. Despite power, nobody could ever attain the status of Hitler.The story of World War-2 has been narrated several times. During the War, there were several important leaders across the world. But people are not interested to know about Hitler's contemporaries. Even despite being the exponent of Fascism and a close ally of Hitler, Benito Mussolini is hardly remembered. This proves like his speech, personality of Adolf Hitler has an intoxicating attraction. There is no reason to justify what Hitler did. After all, no point can justify war or conflict.But if Hitler bears a significant position in the perception of common men and remains as the central theme of creative activity even 2024, the need is to perceive the German dictator with a different approach. Along with the negativities in Hitler, his positive qualities should also be highlighted. The rise of Hitler may be termed as the rise of evil. But this also shows the effort of an isolated and neglected individual to attain higher status. There is a long saga of struggle behind the rise of Hitler. This struggle can never be trivialized. After all, Adolf Hitler curved his destiny himself.If the Documentary projected those facts that transformed Hitler to a ruthless ruler, the psychological issues behind this and the then socio-political reality both in Germany and Europe, this would have been worth watching. What were the factors that changed the perception of a boy who once wanted to become Father of Church? Who killed the artist within Hitler and transformed him into a villain? Why did Hitler prefer arms to music instruments? Without narrating child Adolf with painting brush and music instrument in hands, his devotion and extreme desire to associate with the Church, discussion on Hitler can never be comprehensive. But be as notorious, Hitler is ever present. The creative works made on Hitler have virtually immortalized as someone representing dark. The dramatic and cinematic endeavours or Documentaries on Hitler still attract people. Then who has immortalized Hitler as an evil, Hitler himself or those who have painted his character so far?",

While the character of Griselda Blanco was a bit too sympathetic compared to what she was like in real life, Vergara did an outstanding job in a lead dramatic role, and if she was typecast as Gloria Pritchett she broke from it in a strong way.Supporting cast was very good, I felt there was good chemistry between Vergara and many of the others. Writing seemed very good, well-paced story.I also very much liked the subtitles. This was a nice touch, and is rarely used on such a large scale. The Spanish language was needed to convey the mood and energy of the show, and it worked like a charm. Nicely done.Only had a couple of problems with the series:1) it painted Blanco in way too sympathetic of a light. Anyone who watched the groundbreaking 2006 documentary on the Miami Cocaine Wars called \"Cocaine Cowboys\" would know the real Blanco was far more vicious and cold than Vergara's portrayal. Also, I don't recall the real Blanco being a demagogue of sorts, with stirring, rebellious speeches to rouse her people to take on the rich whites who exploit them. Nice message but I don't think Blanco was like that.2) The series was way too short. Only six episodes? There was so much to Blanco's life that you could have done four full seasons, easily. With flashbacks to her horrific childhood, particularly her upbringing by her vicious, abusive mother, Ana Restrepo. Season 1 could have been her NY days, season 2 Miami, season 3 in California (both as a dealer and her imprisonment, including her relationship with Charles Cosby), season 4 back in Colombia ending with her assassination. This was a very good, well-made series and I wanted to see more.I give this 8\/10 largely due to Vergara's chops in a dramatic, serious role, great writing for what this was (a miniseries), and great supporting cast.",

Honestly the only gripe I have is that everything isn't exactly accurate to Griseldas story and how things happened in real life. I suppose alot of people probably won't really know her story and it's not enough of a big deal to sway you from watching or not watching it. Since the show goes into great detail i just would have preferred them to keep true to how things actually happened instead of some of the things the show has changed. For instance, how Rivi is introduced in the show. In real life they met by chance because Rivi messed a hit up, and Rivi is super essential to Griselda so I don't really understand the way they wrote him and her husband Dario becuase in real life it was Rivi doing alot of the things the show has Dario doing.

Coming from the producers and directors of 'Narcos', I figured this would be just as committed to accuracy and unflinching in its handling of the violence. It seems the producers felt, since this was a woman narco, they had to pull punches. The result is a series that could play on the Lifetime Channel with very little editing.The REAL Griselda Blanco was an unrepentant mass murder. She was directly investigated for 40 murders and believed to be responsible for 250, total. This miniseries glazes over that. There is only a tiny fraction of The Black Widow's hits shown and a lot of the murders take place off camera.Also, the first two episodes seem to be devoted to cementing Griselda Blanco as some sort of feminist icon. I mean why not? She's a 'woman' murdering drug dealer but she's being being picked on by all the 'male' murdering drug dealers. I consider myself a feminist and almost always support the connected causes. Griselda wasn't a 'feminist' any more than Pablo Escobar was a 'humanitarian'.She was a total psychopath who murdered both husbands and an incredible number of people some of whom only had tenuous connections to the drug business. Her assassins didn't care what the collateral damage was and neither did she. Among these were woman and children. Her lifestyle led to death of three of her children. She was a monster and a black hole of a person who swallowed up people whole. She should have been portrayed that way. She is not.While all gangster movies play with the likability of the leading mobster they also show the sides of them that make them horrible. Every good film about the Mob shows its destructiveness.By the time Season 2 of 'Narcos' was over it was quite clear what a monster Pablo Escobar was. By the end of the final episode I think everybody watching feels, 'He got what he deserved'.The 'Griselda' series soft handling of the bad side of Griselda Blanco makes this portrayal feel very dishonest. I found the final scene especially egregious.I really didn't think I was going to write this long of a review. It's just the more I think about this series the less I like it and the message it seems to want to send.",

Still, even if the attempt at a makeover is an unfortunate distraction, everything goes in a \"Scarface\" mode\/formula and delivers a robust and over-the-top performance in this blood-soaked series from the creators of \"Narcos\" that plays like an extended B-movie. Very violent also because it's based on real-life tough events and adhering to a number of major events in Blanco's life, \"Griselda\". The story is highly stylized and fictionalized, as is the case with virtually all of these based-on-a-true-story gangster movies and series but it works..",

It deserves to be seen.",

        "body":"Man, we were truly blessed when Narcos came out in 2015: not many shows nor movies can captivatingly portray a fascinating part of history so effortlessly combining humour, drama, and action. As a victim of its own success, perhaps some of that magic of the first season disappeared with subsequent seasons and the spin-off series Narcos: Mexico, but that's not saying much given the high standards set by that same season. Along comes Griselda: another spin-off series, but this time without the word 'Narcos' in its title (simply Griselda) and thus also more loosely linked to what now can be called a proper franchise. Made by the same people behind Narcos (and Narcos: Mexico), don't let its unique presentation fool you though: this is again a story about one individual's rise and fall through the drug-trafficking business and everything that comes with it. However, that didn't really matter in damping the excitement beforehand as the creators behind Narcos have proven they have mastered this formula. Besides, the drug trafficking business from a female perspective is something I never knew I needed until now. Even if in the end it only lasted for a mere 6 episodes.And it's precisely that fact where the problem lies with this show: it feels rushed. Although 6 episodes is a popular format that's used for either an individual season of a large show or a mini-series, this structure simply doesn't fit the story that is portrayed here. In tradition of the previous Narcos shows that we've had until now, Griselda needed at least two seasons to tell its story properly. Sure, Narcos and Narcos: Mexico also skipped a lot of the facts but that didn't come at the expense of the quality of the experience. That's unfortunately not the case here. Every episode from episode 3 onwards basically skips at least three episodes of good material, which is at odds with how carefully but adequately the show started. How is this rush noticeable? Well, in many ways: character shifts, lack of character development, sudden shifts in tone, a lack of intended impact with unexpected moments, ... and the list goes on and on. In other words, what is lacking is a straight line running through all the 6 episodes. And what you get as a result are episodes that feel detached from each other.But what is even more worrisome is that it's the story that drives the characters and not the other way around as it should be. A good example are the children of Griselda: they have, besides a few moments here and there, very little moments of their own, getting dragged around all of the different locations with little to no protest. The problem overall is that with only 6 episodes, the creators of the show basically obliged themselves to force the story through at the expense of character autonomy. This not only leads to a lack of character development but also, as mentioned before, to sudden shifts in character and tone: the show suddenly becomes really violent halfway through, even though no convincing chain of events were set in place to make that change believable. Another example of this problem is Griselda's character: her change to a ruthless, obsessed godmother may serve the purpose of the story, but the previous episodes do not warrant it nor back it up. Simply explaining what has changed from one episode to the next through narration or one of the characters in dialogue isn't convincing enough for the audience to believe the changes.What this all does is also make the message of the show confusing. Was the intention to make a historically accurate portrayal of what Griselda did during her time in Miami? Or was it rather the idea to give a unique spin to the character of Griselda to explore the unusual role of women in the drug trafficking business? The problem here's consistency in portrayal and tone: almost simultaneously with the increase in violence in the show, Griselda changes to a far more ruthless drug kingpin. This side of Griselda is more in line with what she apparently really was. However, as I have said before, this was not the case in the beginning, which makes you wonder if the creators of this show changed their idea halfway through of what kind of character Griselda should be.Those of you who have seen Narcos: Mexico will clearly recognize the opposite relationship between the honest, good-working cop and the ruthless drug kingpin. Interestingly, the cop in this show is also a woman. However, this relationship and the entire cop-perspective of this story is not developed enough for us to care, making it seem more like an addition to make it clear that Griselda is a show made for female audiences, even if that means that not enough time was left to explore the darker sides of Griselda's character. It doesn't help that the show turned out to be so short. In the end, it feels as if there was no real commitment towards bringing a consistent version of the character of Griselda to life.However, it isn't all bad: the acting here's on point, and nothing is to be said about the production of the show, besides perhaps the slightly weird-looking makeup of Sofia Vergara. Some of the brilliance of the Narcos series also shines through with the humour and unexpected twists and turns that shake up the story which made us fall in love with Narcos in the first place. It truly makes you wonder what this show could have been if it were allowed to develop more. Was the project cut short due to internal difficulties as has been the case with many projects recently due to the recent writer's strike in Hollywood or was this simply how the show was meant to be? I can't help but conclude the former, even more so given how so many actors of Narcos were recast here to the point that it became odd to me not even halfway through.In the end, Griselda is a show that is much inferior in quality compared to the new gold standard of television series set forth by Narcos. Although still entertaining in the Narcos way, it feels a little inferior in quality on all aspects due to story decisions that are partly a result of this show's far too short runtime, even with long individual episodes. As a result, the overall impression is very mixed. It wouldn't be surprising should we see a new portrayal of Griselda in another show or movie in a few years' time, since there is so much wasted potential here. As it stands, it shows that not even shows like Narcos are untouchable.",

It seems really that this was the primary drive behind this historical reenactment to show us that women can be as badass as any guy any time of the day any decade.It seems a little bit redundant and not really needed in 2024 a time in history when no we haven't yet got parity but do we need to be reminded time and time and time again about the bad old days? Griselda here really is as ruthless as the worst of Medellin ever produced. That is undeniable. We end up with dead babies with orphan-making pointless murders all commandeered by Griselda.But the problem for me here is that it seems that it is lauded here as if we should be amazed wonderful what a great lady sort of well done you you can do this as well as your brother could and even possibly better. What she did was practically pure evil let us be clear under guises of I'm doing this for my boys she ran a murderous operation nothing here should be lauded it should be made to look pathetic and sad not look at the Rock Star. And yes later on she gets her just desserts maybe but still for the vast majority of the time we are supposed to gawp at the amazing show she puts on ....Same with the lady copper isn't she wonderful despite all the sexist jokes in her place of work she comes out on top and then she comes out on top isn't she wonderful? Well maybe more so in her case than in the case of Griselda anyway anywayEnough bellyaching from this ingrate viewer here having said all this and I wanted to say all this because I think it needs to be said this is an astounding series in six episodes the acting is stellar the rhythm of every single episode is brilliant always keeping you on the edge of your seat always keeping you guessing as to what might happen next. The men here are truly secondary players as if they were all new men 20 years before this became currency in the 1990s. Secondary roles for the men here. The sense of period from the 1970s with the cars and the clothing and the TV sets all that is done brilliantly tooThere is nothing wrong with the series it is excellent and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to watch something made with quality and high production values; but still I will again say it before I sign off why make a hero out of a truly truly bad villain simply because she wears a skirt ... Seems profoundly twisted to me ... grim Griselda ace series.",

She was murderous, psychopathic, and paranoid among other verifiable facts. The series however portrays her as an affectionate and somewhat naive character navigating the misogynistic world of male-dominated cartels.Sofia Vergara's acting skills are not up to par for a role like this given the grittiness, depth, and ugliness of Griselda. The makeup and facial prosthetics were also extremely visible and distracting. We've seen countless male actors completely transform their bodies and physical appearance for roles yet here the female lead did not even look like a distant relative of Griselda. In my opinion a miscast, but understandable for show marketing purposes.The cinematography, pacing, and other actors were alright but you just can't shake off the feeling that the series was half-baked and rushed. We've seen many excellent true crime shows produced over the years that makes this one ultimately forgettable.",

So, I hoped it would pull me in like Narcos did, for example.The beginning wasn't too bad, I enjoyed some of the character building and scenes in those parts. However, she didn't seem like a ruthless drug queen \"Godmother\" at all, in most of the show.From reading up on Griselda's life and crimes, it wasn't likely that she was sitting around fretting about who she had to kill to get to where she wanted. Yet, there were so many scenes with her worrying. Based on her true story, she didn't think twice about taking the lived of those closest to her (lovers & husbands). Yet, none of this was included in the show. It felt like any hint of how cruel she could be and how drugs were affecting her decision making, was saved for the last couple episodes. It was too fast and dramatic of a change from this housewife who is trying to make it in the drug world., The writers\/producers want you to feel sorry for her during the first 3\/4 of the show and for you to look at her as this heartless criminal at the very end. It story just didn't flow the way it should.As I was watching it, I was thinking of the areas where the writers missed the mark or where it was getting dragged out and boring. That's never a good thing.Lastly, I get they needed to make S. V. look older or more like the real life Griselda for the part. However, it wasn't done well. It bothered me so much at times that I couldn't focus on the scene. Like they caked make-up on her face just to age her and made all her teeth look really yellow. They could have done better.",

Either you pick a different actress or just let us suspend our disbelief and enjoy Sophia's natural face. That said the show is entertaining enough to want to keep watching. I don't like the choice of color grading they went with to make the picture seem dated. Details are not good and everything seems kind of dark and grainy. I would never buy this on 4k disc because they purposefully messed up the picture to make it seem like I'm watching it on VHS. Sophia Vergara does a good job acting. I wish there were more action because the real griselda did some serious killing so there was plenty of material to use. The dialogue is not well written so the action would have made up for it.

Griselda was a gangster from the age of 6 but Sophia stumbles around asking people to try her cocaine, please. No death to the series. Kim Kardashian mentioned it was such an amazing show. That essentially sums up the show. Good concept, but a failed attempt to sexualize cocaine and drug dealing with an unbelievable actress as the lead and poor supporting actors and actresses.

Mainly for herself rather than the crimes, but how the whole story was portrayed was gripping and fascinating. Throughly enjoyed. Shocked and amazed.

Well, with the Netflix miniseries \"Griselda\", we now get her story.If you only know Sofía Vergara as the feisty stepmom on \"Modern Family\", then you're in for a pleasant surprise with her performance here. The show apparently minimizes just how brutal and merciless Griselda Blanco was, but it still makes her out to be pretty vile, even if she saw the cocaine business as the only way out of a bad marriage. Another thing was that the cocaine business was mostly a man's world, and the men didn't like a woman cutting in on their turf (evil though she was).While I admit that I can't verify its veracity, I can say that this is one of the grittiest miniseries that you'll ever see.

But thankfully there is no grandstanding in this Netflix series, no phoney set-pieces, no posturing, although it is certainly full of action.Perhaps, to be on the safe side we should regard this version of Griselda Blanco's rise and fall as the Miami coke capo more as fiction than fact, but that risks doing it an injustice.In fact, in one sense it would be wrong to regard this six-parter as just the latest 'narco drama'. It certainly is that, but it is far more than that. Without sounding to silly, I suggest this series is more along the lines of a tragedy than just another piece of coke-dealing schlock.Griselda was no saint but she got a very rough deal in a very macho, misogynistic world. Her main weapons were her pride, cunning and a determination not to give in. Oh, and a very lethal ruthlessness.She begins to outwit the men one way or another but then it all goes to her head. She also makes the very silly mistake of indulging in her own merchandise too much and becomes murderously paranoid.That's the story. As for the production, writing, acting and direction, it is top-notch. I'll repeat (and I hope I don't sound stupid) this is a very human story, and it's not that the grandstanding is kept to a minimum, it's that there is none at all.The characters, from Griselda herself, her two main henchman - both also utterly ruthless - to the female detective are three-dimensional and believable.The detective in one way is a kind of counterweight to Griselda, but on the other side of the law. She too has to contend with very nasty misogyny but she is also a proud and strong woman who refuses to give in to macho creeps.You might well have seen this series. If you haven't and are checking out opinions, my advice is to go for it as one of the best of its kind I've seen for some time.",

Now those scenes could be the part where the show does take creative liberties, as from most accounts Griselda is not sympathetic at all but instead truly cold-blooded. At any rate, I enjoy the revelation that is Sofia Vergara - who knew she had real acting chops! Kudos! I also find the actress playing June the female cop rather fascinating. It's also refreshing that Spanish is appropriately used in the majority of the dialogue as it should be, injecting more authenticity than other productions like the inferior \"Cocaine Godmother.\"",

Determined to survive and prosper, she seizes on a chance to make her mark in the drug business, and before long has flooded the clubs and streets with her product, whilst brutally maintaining her place at the top. All seems to be going well, until Agent June (Juliana Aidan Martinez), leads an investigation to bring her down.\"The only man I ever feared was a woman, named Griselda Blanco.\" This quote from Pablo Escobar appears in the opening shot of the first episode in this Netflix limited series from director Andres Baiz. When the most notorious drug lord of all time makes this claim, it certainly serves as some unsavoury publicity for what you're in for. And Baiz's short, sweet series is certainly not shy of depicting the brutal, bloodthirsty violence inherent in the world of Blanco, with a commanding lead performance from Vergara at the centre of it all.As a limited series with a condensed amount of episodes, Baiz doesn't invest too much time in Blanco's history or backstory, although there is a sufficient amount to get an impression of who she was and what motivated her to make the choices she did. At times, the script becomes overly theatrical, with Griselda losing the self control that got her to the top too readily (most notably, a boat party sequence towards the end, where in a coke induced psychosis, her recklessness nearly has catastrophic consequences), and so the dramatic impact is lost when it becomes too frequent. While Vergara is required by the script to go wild, she is complimented by co star Martinez as the female agent on a mission to bring her down. They're two females on different sides of the law, determined to prove themselves in the male dominated worlds they both inhabit, and contrast each other quite well as a whole.All in all, it's a successful effort in spite of its flaws, with an intriguing central protagonist, and a decent, funky soundtrack to prop it up. Sadly, it's just that notch short of perfect to stop it short of what it could be. ***",

The show is self-aware, using its crude humor to make sharp, if not controversial, commentary on society.But let's be clear: this show is not for everyone. If you're easily offended, it's best to steer clear. Even for those with a tougher skin, the comedy here is a mixed bag - it's not always hitting home runs, but when it does, it elicits a genuine, albeit guilty, laugh.In essence, \"Good Times\" isn't the pinnacle of comedic brilliance but it doesn't try to be.

Throughout, let's just say that I hated every inch of this reboot, even more offensive than the grotesque splatter is the use of a baby as a drug dealer, now I found that to be completely cynical and truly dreadful, this is yet another reason why I turned the TV off, the first in 12 years, this new good times is just truly pathetic and it's heading on my list of the worst television of 2024 and it deserves to beI gave good times a big fat f.",

Sadly, those defending this show as funny do not realize that these same creators and producers would NEVER make a show with stereotypes like this for non-Black people. Saying this baby is comparable to Stewie is the definition of Playing in our faces. One baby is a drug dealer and the other is a witty genius. This is a 2024 minstrel show and Netflix should be ashamed for airing it. This show is not Boondocks and it's definitely is not a reboot of Good Times. The live show ended with the Evans family getting out of the projects and moving toward creating generational wealth. Seth and Steph's show has the family five generations later in a situation that is absolutely 100 levels worse and no improvement or inspiration to be had. This show Is the definition of Blaxploitation and I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired of how Black Americans are represented, even when it is supposed to be satire. This is not satire, it is just sad and tired.",

I laughed out loud a few times and the characters featured (Elon Musk, Maya Angelou) added to the funny. And for those making a big deal about a baby drug dealer, this is not a new concept of the adult situation baby in the Seth MacFarlane universe (see Family Guy). So, I doubt race (ism) has anything to do with it. This also reminds me of The PJ's of the early 2000's. Some people on their high horse about a series that is not to be taken that seriously. The original 'Good Times' was a cultural phenomenon realized many years after it ended (along with other Norman Lear produced sitcoms). However, at the time it premiered, it's premise was not revered by many Black Americans who did not want to see \"the struggle\" on T. V., along with a little clown-nery.",

        "body":"I watched this whole series and while I found some of the scenarios interesting and overall would say I enjoyed watching it, I couldn't shake the feeling of the characters archetypes being lazily written. As someone who enjoys adult cartoons, it would be nice to see newer ones explore developing characters that don't feed into the same tired old stereotypes about Black American family structures: the extremist activist, the overworked and broke father, the drug dealer\/gangster, etc... I think if they put more effort into developing the characters outside of this bubble, the show would be even more interesting and funny.So for my overall opinion...Positives: The art style of the cartoon is very engaging. Some of the scenarios are interesting and funny, and there are definitely parts that are very relatable. I enjoyed the fact that there was regular involvement from characters outside of the direct family unit in the main storyline, as opposed to having them only contribute to occasional side stories like how cartoons such as American Dad, The Cleveland Show, and Family Guy create their extra characters.Negatives: The character archetypes feel lazy and not well thought out, all of the characters are based on some type of stereotype about African Americans, Black Caribbean's, and Black Africans. If the cartoon's target audience is intended to be Black people, I think they need to do better at creating characters that feel more reflective of the diversity of the Black community, without pandering to expected stereotypical portrayals for entertainment value. There is definitely room for improvement.",

It looked as though they threw spare change at it and managed to get everything about Chisholm wrong.Now Good Times. This insulting portrayal, steeped in old stereotypes, is just the tip of the iceberg. And I highly doubt this poorly executed, offensive mess will win them any new audience.Netflix originals have become increasingly unbearable. From the disaster that was the Zack Snyder debacle to the mishandling of \"3 Body Problem,\" it's evident that Netflix's enthusiasm for new creators and bold ideas has waned, replaced by tired clichés and a race to the bottom.We may be witnessing the twilight of the streaming golden age, but I never imagined quality would plummet to such depths in a business model reliant on subscriber retention.",

A drug dealing baby, numerous shootouts, frequent use of the N word, singing cockroaches and a male character walking around with his testicles barely covered up after taking a shower will quickly convince you this garbage has nothing sensible in common with the historic show (celebrating its 50th anniversary this year).All aforementioned happened in the first episode of which I found so offensive and unfunny I turned it off without finishing it. Ms Shepard has stated viewers should watch all ten episodes before passing judgement- that's not going to happen. Apparently most viewers aren't impressed- released on April 12th it ranked as a lower rated Top Ten Netflix show a week later but fell from the rankings the second week.

I don't understand how it even made it to Netflix. When this was pitched there is no way people actually thought this would be a good idea. Someone should have stood up and spoke sense into whoever came up with this idea. The makes black people look ridiculous and ignorant. It's 2024 we are far more educated and wealthy, we don't have our babies selling drugs. It's so funny to me that a white man is the creator of the show.

They are simply, put awful to get your head around, just doesn't really make much sense and you're not in the right space yet. Indeed go back and watch the 1st two episodes after finishing the series and they become pretty good actually. That's because now you know where the director is coming from.The reason why it is not well received is because a \"black character heavy\" animation has dared to cross the line into, abstract black (as in dark) humour. If you were to cross South Park with Rick and Morty, you'd arrive somewhere around here. South park is to Colorado as this is to Chicago. A wonderfully exaggerated Chicago. Where tenament blocks may well be attacked by a mutated sewer iguana, while the female matriarch protagonist struggles to convince a cabal of white institutionally embedded lizard people, of her innocence in the cases of illegal pangolin false nail smuggling for fentanyl cartel Dons going in the basements of their projects. All the while, managing a home with two teenagers, a toddler and an inept husband.It is incredibly good. Like others before it. The Simpsons, family guy American dad. They're all the same with their own take, their own flavours and identity. Why on earth this is a reboot I have no idea.The animation is vibrant and very psychedelic graphic noir. Storylines are of the abstract meet the everyday. Through the lenses of all the characters. It's not for the faint hearted, but if it ever meets it's audience, comicon diehard gamer types. This is gold!I hope it gets another series.",

So y'all wanna kill another black show.... What else is new🤔. Netflix obviously picked it up because it's funny. Hell even F is for Family got extended seasons. The fact that black oriented shows can't live is because of the people who are uncomfortable watching it. But if u have an open mind & empathy, with a little retrospective maybe u will enjoy the jabs & barbs they are throwing out. It's the same way the Cleveland show didn't last, or Boondocks, & dare I say Black Dynamite. Some of the funniest animated shows ever, but they will never get a run of 30, 20, 10 years...

I'll even argue they have one of the things any good sitcom needs which is a strong and relatable mother and father. The characters show hard work, integrity, and they're flawed.

The documentary lays out a long cycle of events that began with the atomic bombings in Japan in 1945 and how the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the USSR in 1991 signaled a false end to the Cold War, which has led to Putin's attempt to rebuild the Russian Empire in the 21st century.If you're any kind of history buff like I am, turn on this show.

There is a lot of great footage and history covered off - some fantastic insights and great scientific information too. But unfortunately they opted to inject some old fashioned propaganda into the final couple of episodes, after foreshadowing this in the earlier ones.In short, what was predominantly a \"nuclear paranoia drove the world wild with fear and led to idiotic levels of armaments at the expense of cultural, scientific, and social advancement\" (on both sides to varying degrees - Soviet citizens suffering considerably more) has an underlying message of \"orange man bad, Putin bad, Zelensky good, Government narrative on war is true, etc\"\nThere's no question that the aforementioned personalities are fraught with issues - but having covered the propaganda, subterfuge, and shadowy behaviour from the cold war, it is hard not to question the way they glossed over how widespread certain actions from the 50's through the 70s were, along with the way they tried to paint current situation.I'm sure the military industrial complex overlords loved the \"war is for peace\" message that it felt like it ended on.",

I realize this is impossible, but I just had to state it so maybe ONE person will consider what we're all here for.This series ties generations together to make sense of where and why we are here, politically. It's laser focused, as far as I'm concerned, toward the very important wide view message that we need to fully comprehend what us humans have done in creating these massive annihilation nuclear devices.I truly think if you disregard this whole work, you are for the destruction of cultures, land, identity, environment, and humanity itself.

        "body":"There were sequences in this series that left me speechless, spellbound, with more emotional punch than slickest creature feature or superhero movie that have just about crowded out all other types of low budget or thoughtful, meaningful pictures in the theaters of America.Even though I grew up along with these events (born in the 50's) I have been sort of clueless as to what has been going on in the world all these years. Often, I've just gone along with the prevailing opinions, or opposing opinions because I consider myself to be a rebel. But, watching this series showed me history I had either ignored, been too busy to care about, or being misled by outright lies, well it was a real eye opener.These filmmakers have gotten their hands on footage that was way too graphic for network TV, so most people never saw it as events developed. How often do Americans get to watch Russian TV? Putin with a big smile hiding that devil inside as he appears on TV daily, lying about everything, the people just lapping it up with tremendous applause?Much of it is the work of dedicated and courageous reporters and cameramen and writers and publishers who often put their life on the line to get the truth out. A lot of them died in the process.This series is all about courage. How important having courage is. Not being afraid to admit your mistakes and errors, being willing to change your mind if it becomes obvious you are wrong. How tyrants become who they are. And being willing to stand up and fight for what you believe in, even if it kills you.It's the best historical drama I've ever seen.",

        "body":"While every producer and writer shapes the narrative they present, for me the measure of good content is a concerted effort to be objective. The Netflix documentary \"Turning Point: The Bomb and the Cold War\" is a nine-part series that has some of the best interviews I have seen about the Fall of the Wall. Having attended the Institute of European Studies in Vienna, Austria in 1989\/1990 I have the benefit of direct experience as a baseline. The most insightful aspect of the documentary was additional insight on the rise of Putin, who continues to represent a dangerous authoritarian threat to Europe and the world. Putin is a master manipulator, and the scope of his brutal aggressions are well documented.A glaring omission from Netflix's Turning Point documentary is Taiwan, which would not exist if the U. S. 7th Fleet had not patrolled the Taiwan Strait in 1950. The producers and writers of Netflix's Turning Point were less than objective about John Foster Dulles' contribution to the containment of the People's Republic of China, which permitted Taiwan's independence. The motivation behind such a glaring omission is likely related to Netflix's desire to avoid targeted censorship in China. Another under reported item in the Turning Point documentary is the importance of USSR's withdraw from Afghanistan in February 1989, which set the stage for largely peaceful revolutions that swept Eastern Europe during the second half of 1989.A curious aside, when Star Wars was filmed in 1976, China's economy was largely agrarian. It is remarkable to me how the actions of Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping are more and more akin to the Evil Empire depicted in the movies that follow the development of planet killing powers. It is hard to know when art imitates life or vise versa. Having witnessed the generational losses imposed on Eastern Europe and Russians firsthand in 1989 and 1990, I know democracy is worth fighting for.",

No one side was glorified or condemned - it was refreshing how the documentary was candid both about the plenty of mess-ups that the US made, and the successful de-escalation efforts by Soviet leaders of the time.It was not an easy viewing for me, due both to the documentary's sheer length (10 hours!) and its distressing subject matter. The fact that the documentary takes the liberty to be moralizing is easily forgiven in light of its balanced delivery and the fact that Kremlin that is waging unprovoked war against a sovereign country and is employing all means at its disposal - including nuclear threats - thus yet again escalating the level of risk in the world.

Now, that's not saying anyone is lying or even that the interview subjects are being manipulative, but because of the dense nature of espionage, intelligence, sensitivity to national security etc....there's going to be a lot of conjecture, and a lot of details left out. By it's nature, it would be impossible to fully and fairly grasp the Cold War. (Especially if you're American or Russia because you already have an inherent bias.)All of that said, this is a very deep and well put together series which paints the Russians as bad, and capitalism as bad, and Ukraine are just these innocent little people stuck in the middle and why it's important for America to protect them. I'm not saying that's wrong, I'm saying there is a whole of details just inside of Ukraine and their political maneuverings that warrant analysis. For this, it reads like a very entertaining and good historical piece, that leans towards war propaganda.It's fantastically put together. The storytelling is fairly exceptional in how they set up all the key points and then pay them off. Some very good soft influencing and subliminal emotional manipulation. (That's what storytelling is all about, that's sincerely not a knock, it's high praise.) So for that, along with outstanding interview lighting, and a slew of experts. Then the b-roll editing of archival footage. It's just a great piece through and through.Again, must be cautioned: Before you run out and put a Ukrainian flag on your front doorstep and start reading \"The Communist Manifesto\" understand that there are significant details not being explored which would make you reconsider those positions. Now if you're already doing those things, this piece is 100% confirmation bias, though there are a few places you might be challenged.On the subject of Ukraine, I watched the both documentaries \"Winter on Fire\" and \"Ukraine on Fire\". Very different perspectives, and one had a much more significant budget, but I loved how many things they explored which were the same, but from vastly different lenses. I can with a rational mind see the bias in both and then weigh the factual evidence to determine my position which is what I strongly advise people to do during the fog of war.",

It doesn't use any time at all to explain where this anger against the rich came from, or to explain the suppression the working class was living under that gave him the support to do this.All in all a good documentary series, but sadly becomes a bit of a propaganda-series for capitalist values.

A brilliant opening episode suckers you in with new insights on the end of the Second World War, something I didn't think possible after nearly eighty years of research and study. You're set up and ready for more, and then comes episode two, the fifties, the cold war and the demagoguery of Joseph McCarthy. Incredibly, they manage to smear Trump with the execution of the Rosenbergs and the House Unamerican Activities Committee, notwithstanding that he was literally in short trousers at the time.

It's always fascinating to connect the dots of history to see how we arrived to this situation. It's supposed to be shown in schools, but I guess 8 episodes of 50 minutes each aren't enough to explain all the aspects of the Cold War. Very intense footages and qualified interviews.

It spends way too much time focusing on nuclear weapons and immediately outdated Ukraine information. It sets the scene that the Cold War was heavily influenced by the possession of nukes but putters around with very specific details of the Ukraine war. The perfect encapsulation of the documentaries lack of focus is the trump section. It literally blames Russia for Trump and caps off the section by saying there's no proof that Russia influences the election results.

This is blatant agenda pushing\/propaganda.I'm an American who typically votes democrat, but I couldn't handle the agenda pushing.It spends an inordinate time on American atrocities like CIA overthrowing foreign governments. But spends almost no time on anything Soviet (at least in the episodes i saw)For example, it lightly touches on Stalin's Gulags, like barely at all. But we get a 10 minute false narrative about the Rosenberg's.Here's the facts, they weren't innocent at all, literally not an opinion, Julius Rosenberg was a soviet spy, that is a fact you can look up right now.They brought in his son to talk about how unfair it all was, his father was a literal Soviet Spy, and after their deaths, they were adopted by Communists because the rest of their families didn't want them. Which is tragic, but they are nowhere near unbiased.After researching the sons, they have spent their whole lives trying to clear the names of their parents. When the documents were released that their father was undoubtedly a soviet spy (I believe this happened in 2008) they switched to just defending the mother.Another thing that was quite absurd was they played 2 sequences of \"mournful music\" as it appeared in the Netflix subtitles. One when the Rosenburg's were executed and one when Stalin died. (Huh?)What got me to stop watching was in episode 4 when the following line was used, \"the Russians didn't want to be a military superpower\".After hearing that absurd statement, I realized that this wasn't going to be a fair, factual overlook of the cold war, something I would have loved to see.It's a shame, because the visuals are excellent. But this isn't worth your time if you're looking for a fair accounting of the Cold War.After the Cleopatra and Alexander \"Documentaries\", and now this disaster, these types of dramas is what we can expect from Netflix. Good looking stories, that are full of false information and agenda pushing.",

Skillfully draws a thread through events from WWII to the present day - including Hiroshima & Nagasaki; birth of the CIA and its unchecked power of the 50s; rise of Castro and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1959-1962; Vietnam War; Chernobyl and the thawing of tension between Reagan and Gorbachev in the 80s; fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989; collapse of the Soviet Union and Russia's failed transition to democracy in the 90s; emergence of Putin and context for the ongoing war in Ukraine - while pitting them all against the unsettling, uninterrupted and unprecedented threat of a nuclear apocalypse.Series does a commendable job of synopsizing 75 years of world history into a digestible format. There are spots of propaganda for sure, but it also includes moments of objectivity where no one looks good, such as \"Dr. Strangelove was a documentary. Everything there could have actually happened,\" \"The global economic system is based on an understanding that the developed countries that *consume resources need to be able to control the countries where those resources are *produced,\" etc.I'd recommend trying Episode 1 just because it gives a good taste of the full meal.Note: I could do without the pre-opening credits \"vignettes\" on Ukraine, tho. I'm a supporter of the cause, but they rarely add much to the episodes and make it (too) easy for skeptics to dismiss the overall content. Just my opinion.---Individual episode rankings:3: Excellent. Emergence of Khrushchev in Russia. Birth of the CIA and coups\/interventions worldwide in the name of \"democracy\" (including in Iran and Guatemala). Anti-communist movement and actual nuclear war planning in communities across America. H-bomb testing. 9\/10.1: Reorganization of global power in the wake of WWII. 8\/10.6: I'd never fully understood how the Iron Curtain came down in the late 80s. This one made me feel like I was there. 7.5\/10.8: Useful history lesson on how Russian oligarchs got wealthy from the demise of the Soviet Union, and how Putin later monopolized that same system for himself. 7\/10.4: Gripping footage of the Cuban Missile Crisis. 6.5\/10.2: Stalin-era Russia. A bit dry compared to the others. 4.5\/10.5: Filler episode save for the last 15 minutes that cover the Chernobyl accident. 3\/10.9: Heavy on Ukraine. Almost feels like watching the news today, for better or worse. But the episode's conclusion at a ceremony in Japan commemorating the lives lost in 1945 ties a powerful bow on the series. 2.5\/10.7: Transition from Gorbachev\/Soviet Union to Yeltsin\/Russia. Historically important but wouldn't watch it again. 2\/10.Max episode score = 9. Min = 2. Median = 6. Mean = 5.5556. High school Stats class came in handy after all! Lol.",

True-crime cases can be equal parts fascinating and horrifying, but nothing wormed its way into my brain quite like the fear of those few truly strange incidents that could not be fully explained - and I've stayed that way ever since.Throw in a few anomalous experiences through life, and you have an example of the perfect target audience for this new series. I've always said 'give me Unsolved Mysteries without the murder cases' and this is essentially that. I understand and respect that some folks have the entirely opposite opinion, where they want more crime and less 'woo', but to be fair Netflix has big budget crime content by the ton. This simply balances the scales a tiny bit.Nobody is asking you to believe without evidence, or to watch this and change your world-view. I feel like all that's being asked is that people give it a chance without negative preconceptions. Even if you don't believe those retelling their experiences, it seems clear to me that the vast majority of the witnesses are at least sincere in believing what they're saying to be truthful.Folks like Terry Lovelace (EP4) have told their story with deep conviction so many times now without a single contradiction or stumble on the detailed timeline of alleged events. Either it happened, or the former Assistant Attorney General of Vermont (yes, Terry was the Asst. AG) retired only to apparently throw away his credibility by confessing about his encounter with the unknown.This will be polarising, and that's fine. I consider myself a true skeptic, where I find these topics interesting and worthy of discussion, but won't assert extraordinary claims without the required evidence.

It frequently turns into a word salad of all the buzz words of the social woes of the south.Beyond that it drags, ideas are repeated frequently. Each episode has enough content to occupy about 5 minutes that they stretch into 40 minutes.Lots of TikTok videos about the focus of the episode. Is that your source? Because we all know social media is the go to source for accurate and verified information.Also, the Lake Lanier episode does as great job of lumping all of us Natives into one homogenous group who only have one thought, one speak and one voice. Tired of the same old trope of Indian deaths produce ghost stories. Ridiculous. Insulting. Garbage.",

Being live things can happen (burn, not come out right, etc.) unlike a taped show where it is swapped out or edited.A bonus for me that I was not expecting was one of my favorite K-drama actors Steven Yeun who I recognized from the recent Netfix drama Beef was the invited guest. Since I am from Chicago and have gone to Second City for wuite a few nights out, I can relate to his humor since he has a background there. Maybe this is why this show appeared on my suggestion list since I watch a lot of K-Drama. It was nice to get to see one of my favorite actors converse with friends as himself (not acting) and get to know what a nice guy he is and also some personal info he divulged straight from his own mouth. I also recognized. Rashida Jones from The Office and enjoyed her banter as well.I could tell the host chef was a little nervous (just a tad) being the first episode, mostly due to the time restrictions and talking at the same time as cooking but am sure it will all be ok now.

Even the cooking is missing some sizzling, smokes... sounds and pizzazz to make live shows interesting.Or maybe it can use some funny animation effects to liven things up. Or stage this in a private area in a real restaurant so that we can still see the buzz in the background. I understand that Netflix might want to minimize any unexpected incidents.Never been so thankful for a relatively funny extra guest - Chris Ying - to show up midway to provide comedic relief with close-ups of mistakes and commentary.And David Chang seems a bit nervous. It's the first attempt in pioneering something, I get it. But since the premise is already being casual and entertaining and not being worried about screwing things up, why not just... be more relaxed. He doesn't even have to take the guests' questions seriously (even though I know he has a reputation as a famous chef to keep). On top of that, to spell out how difficult it is to do something that's meant to be entertaining? Maybe get a sous chef? Or at least a buffoon archetype?It's just so, so dry as it is. Even a decent mukbang featuring no one well-known is more watchable. Thankfully Steven Yeun and Rashida Jones are easygoing guests. Will things get better? Hope so.",

        "body":"*Updated*\nI'm updating my review because I think I was unfair to a new show that was finding its groove and I believe this show has found it. David Chang is really interesting to watch and listen to and I love that he explains why he does something with the food but he's not actually teaching how to cook.The format of the show is similar to a podcast as compared to traditional talk shows that give you between 7 to 12 minutes with guests that are only there doing a quick shallow promotion of their recent work. But the guests on this show stay for the entire show so they have actual conversations. This is how a evening with good friends is like.* * *\n(Previous review)\nI enjoyed the episodes with Steven Yuen\/Rashida Jones, Fortune Feimster\/Terry Crews, Iliza Schlesinger\/Paul Scheer. It's like a talk show with guests and they're having a good conversation, sharing thoughts, opinions, and experiences.However, I really did not enjoy the episodes with Nick Kroll\/john Mulaney and the most recent one with Seth Rogen\/Ike Barinholtz. It's like watching a bunch of guys in high school cracking jokes and making innuendos, snide remarks, and just being obnoxious. I'm a guy and I get it..but these episodes were not interesting or entertaining watching them guffaw, snort, chuckle, with outbursts of shouting over each other. The food in the episode with Seth\/Ike was actually disgusting and not creative. David Chang just scooped gobs of caviar on everything, including pizza, like he was too stoned to cook.",

Blanton show of excess wealth.The concept seems interesting and original, but it's been done before like Seinfeld's comedians in cars getting coffee.Also, he licked his fingers and kept rolling the sushi!

This misnomer not only reveals a significant gap in Chang's understanding of Japanese cuisine but also diminishes the cultural and technical precision that defines maki sushi.What should have been an opportunity to showcase and honor the intricate artistry of maki-making instead devolved into a misleading portrayal.

This first season is about the tragic life of Aaron Hernandez and his rise and fall from being an NFL star. It does a good job making you feel empathy for Hernandez for all that he had to go through growing up but it doesn't make you feel any sympathy because he still made his choices. It doesn't take any of the guilt away from Hernandez but shows how the people in his life influenced the man he became. The show also does a good job showing the story from different perspectives of the man Hernandez was. The best part of the show is Josh Rivera portrayal of Aaron Hernandez. He does such a great job. He even looks like him except for being a few inches shorter. I'm looking forward to future seasons from this show.",

I see some people are upset because they think the shows goes easy on Aaron Hernandez and blames others for his mistakes. I don't see it that way at all. It shows every despicable thing he's done but there's a reason he ended up becoming the person he is. He had an abusive father, a mom who cared about herself above all others, how he was ashamed he was bisexual and that he had CTE. Those are all facts that led to him becoming who he is. He was not a good person and this shows that. American Sports Story is another compelling show in a long line of them from Ryan Murphy.",

I can't remember if he ended up in prison or was killed by someone so the ending's a mystery to me, which makes watching this more compelling.

        "body":"This is a subject that was done to very close detail on many true crime documentaries. It really was unlike anything we've seen before. You had a super star New England Patriot no less at the pinnacle of sports. He was moonlighting as a double murderer and criminal. So of course this is going to be done over and over. One of the reviewers wasn't totally wrong about the Ryan Murphy take. He usually show horns homosexuality into his work, but to be fair there were a lot of accusations about him being gay or bi sexual. It has a part to play in the story, especially him being this macho football player in NFL. So leaving that apart I think the actor does a good job at playing him. The story follows the facts for most part and then of course there is Hollywood stuff in the story. That goes for everything pretty much. Certain things are necessary for the sake of a full series and not everything is absolutely as it was. We will never get the whole story about who this monster was, but by now I think we have a good enough idea. Not since OJ has their been something like it, and Aaron Hernandez was actually convicted and doing these things while actively playing on Tom Brady led Patriot Super Bowl teams. I mean the story is incredible and made for tv. Basically a serial killer by night that we are watching and glorifying every Sunday in what is like religion in this country in the NFL. Anybody complaining on here that it puts Aaron in a bad light is totally missing the point or some kind of family member or something. Guy was a total monster who executed his friend in cold blood and left his body like garbage. Let's remember who the real victims were here. I don't care how bad his upbringing in Bristol was it doesn't excuse what he did. The angle that somehow if his sexuality could have freed him that he wouldn't have been a murderer is also a bit ridiculous to be kind. In the end it is a decent series but like I said you can get much more facts in any one of the 3-4 documentaries that Netflix or Oxygen channel did on him. This is typical Ryan Murphy style show and not a doc. So that is the major difference. It's not the worst thing I ever saw. If you never saw the Netflix doc or OXYGEN one then skip the show and just warm.",

Sure, he had a troubled life and committed crimes before the murder and those things certainly warrant some examination, but 7+ episodes worth? There's a reason those stories didn't make big headlines at the time--because they're, frankly, not that interesting. Worse, as the show has dragged closer to its finale, it's clear that the story of the murder, subsequent trial, and Aaron's death will be told in a completely rushed fashion. Maybe this show could have worked as a 6 episode series that gave a little backstory about Hernandez and then focused on the murder, trial, and Aaron's death, but there is just not nearly enough interesting material here for this to have been dragged out to 10 episodes.",

        "body":"\"A Real Bug's Life\" (2024) is a docuseries about what the title implies, bugs. This series is a not too serious view on the lives of bugs in 5 episodes.The reason why i say: \"not too serious\", is because of the silly music, and sound effects. For example zooming in on an ant trail and it sounding like a highway with cars or a spider webbing up it's sleeping space and it sounding like it is taping up something with scotch tape. This can be amusing in a childish kind of way, but it is not what I specifically am looking for in nature documentaries.Casting Awkwafina as a narrator was good in my opinion, she has been getting a lot of big roles so this is a good change of pace. The only thing that bothers me is the way they went with the dialogue, this is definitely not my cup of tea.The humor and music they use in this series is not particularly amusing to me, hearing rap or them making a joke about a spider dreaming about seeing a fly in all of it's eyes is not the thing i am looking for when i am wanting to learn about certain critters and creatures.I really enjoyed the close-ups on every creature so we could really enjoy what they look like in high quality footage, this is done with the latest and newest technology of course.I get that it is called after a beloved Pixar animations movie and that the goal is not to be too serious, but in my opinion this is what makes it less like something i want to watch.",

They give each insect a story and that along with the amazing camera work makes it feel like a movie which helps the kids stay engaged.It isn't the most \"educational\" in terms of just throwing facts at you but it's a good one to introduce your young kids to if you want them to learn about insects as each episode teaches them about bugs that they will see in their back yard or city and what their role is in the city environment and made my kids want to go outside to see what insects they could find.Nothing wrong with the voice actor but if you don't like Awkwafina you may not like it.",

It is clearly aimed at 8-10 year olds (not surprising for Disney) but the voice over track was very annoying to the point where muted it half way through series. The script lacked proper facts and any depth of detail.Captions for the names of the bugs including common and scientific names along with a fact sheet would have enhanced the educational nature of the programme. And instead of sitting on the fence 'suggesting' bugs are good and necessary it should have been at the forefront of the narrative.This would have gotten 2 star if it wasn't for the amazing camera work and my love of bugs as macro photographer.",

And wow talk about crying foul how many times can those involved foul out. The series in a blunt and brash fashion takes a look at the life of ex \"L. A. Clippers\" owner Donald Sterling(Ed O' Neill from \"MWC\") and how he was banned for life from the \"NBA\". The series hams it up and tries to be juicy and tabloid like style as each episode showcased leaked comments that Sterling made to his former mistress V. Stiviano. Also behind the scenes with Sterling is the strained relationship with his wife and business partner Shelly(Jacki Weaver). In a good supporting turn is veteran Laurence Fishburne as Clippers head coach Doc Rivers who deals with the power struggle from within the franchise while trying to coach the team to a championship. The issues are sensitive and tough yet this series is fearless with it as it is entertaining for any sports or \"NBA\" fan despite the fact that it's not the Lakers or \"Winning Time\".",

The events happened in 2014 and now over 10 years later, we are having this series showing further details. This is being said simply because the interest to this story isn't nearly as high or anticipated currently as it would have had this had been several years ago.However as a show, it does provide a lot of things in which people who were following the story at the time, are already familiar. Mainly the basics. Most of the newer knowledge dealt with the character of V. Stiviano who is a primary character as it delves into her life further and her role to everything.The acting from the leads are definitely worthy of watching. The subject matter is definitely serious and overall was engaging in watching and remembering its events. The finale episode was rather anticlimactic and ended somewhat abruptly.

What I can say so far is that while the production values are high, the underlying true story is poorly told.Sterling's egomaniacal failure as a franchise owner would have made for a compelling story. But so far it's shaping up to be a banal referendum on his moral character and his tattletale sugar-baby lady of the night being positioned as an anti-hero by being spiteful.I hope I'm wrong but I'm afraid that this Hulu special will be of the Netflix ilk of progressive grandstanding as if we haven't been beaten over the head with the social sensitivity agenda a million times over.

Stavros was really good in the episodes as well and I was most surprised by his performance. Steve who played Will was very strong. In the end you get a good connection with allthe characters and I'm glad to hear season 2 is a GO from Netflix. The first couple of episodes are a little slow but they all find their stride. I really liked all the characters. Schultz even was likable. Shane of course, was enjoyable to watch and some of his lines were delivered with perfection.",

The writers Steven Gerben, John Mckeever and Shane have done a great job making something familiar but new, it could be compared to the office but it's really it's own beast because of the setting, this is male bestfriends doing what male best friends do and the humour that comes out is amazing. All cast members do a great job, the directing is good and the pace is solid once you are invested.

But in Episode 2, the jokes come faster, the writing improves, the editing gets slicker, and the human moments begin to hit. Overall I found it funnier than most sitcoms. The show leans more into the humor and less into plot, which is refreshing.If you like Shane Gillis' standup you'll enjoy the show. If you don't appreciate standup or have a delicate sensibility, you'll probably find it offensive.

Six, 20-minute episodes make the entire series an easy watch in one sitting. The show ramps up over time as characters slowly develop, although it feels like we never really get to know all of the cast due to the short series format. There are plenty of humorous moments, so long as you're willing to accept the premise of the show is looking through the narrow lens of a male dominated work environment. Steve Gerben plays a convincing role of ineptness and innocence, creating the perfect launching pad for comedic antics.

Shane Gillis and company poke fun at themselves as well as poking fun at others. It's extremely familiar in the sense that everyone has worked with these people in some fashion. Tires is the perfect watch if you want to relax and have a few laughs by yourself or with friends. If you're on lunch and you just want to throw something on while you eat than look no further.

Trust me, I've worked in male workplaces more extreme than Tires (could write ten seasons of a sitcom with what I saw) and nobody ever simulated oral sex on a co worker to the minute details.

It's incredibly important for a show of this style for the audience to care about the characters, and this one pulls it off well.

        "body":"I'm a fan of Shane. Episodes are short so time passes quickly. The premise is really basic so I'm not sure where this could go, but these first six episodes were enjoyable. The writing isn't going to win any awards, there aren't scenes that are really memorable, it's neither really witty nor is it a biting commentary on anything. It's blue collar lives having fun, surviving more than thriving, with their heart in the right place. It's clearly written so that Shane can shine, he does his thing, and it works well enough.Some comments are calling it a blue collar version of the office, but here you really only have Shane carrying the show, so I don't see this going very far. Getting Netflix to bank a show is a great achievement in itself.",

The lack of political correctness and a flow of situations that makes this excellent. Episodes 4,5,6 are just amazing. This is incredibly gentle but also very raw in places. I lived that element about the show. This may become one of the very best shows on Netflix and I really hope there is a season two as this show really deserves to be given another season. I would approach this with an open mind and just enjoy the ride, it's a wild show that really is heart warming in so many places. Watch it!",

Shane does his job well and Andrew Shultz as a wop is absolutely perfect.Actors do what's required, they are not perfect but it's almost better that way.

Writers Gerben and McKeever along with Shane gave us a fun quick easily digestible form of comedy. A show that doesn't take itself too seriously and is not afraid to toe the line. Hopeful and excited for a second season, would love to see shane bring in more familiar faces from his other adventures. Including some other female comedians and some bigger names could help keep some interest. Loved every minute of it and can't wait for more Shane on netflix.",

Idk how much money was put into this show but it wasn't enough or it wasn't spent appropriately.The whole this just wasn't funny and I was really looking forward to it.

If you like Shane Gillis and his work, you're definitely gonna enjoy this.The setting is simple, and a lot of people can understand the setting and scenarios that take place. The jokes are very funny, and the characters are fun to watch as-well, and the antics that happen do keep me interested.For what the show is, critics are way too critical of it. Yes, it does have an amateur feeling to it, the jokes are lowbrow, and the show works a lot better if you like Shane Gillis. It's not 100% perfect, but the show has potential to be a cult hit, and Netflix probably knows that too, no wonder they renewed the show even before it got released. I am very interested to see how Season 2 does.So, if you don't have a preference for highbrow humor, enjoy offensive shock humor, and are looking to enjoy silly jokes, this show is probably for you. However, if you do prefer highbrow humor, a distaste for shock humor, and are looking for massive character depth and growth, this is not the show for you.",

I realize this \"Worker not Woker\" theme was their intention, but it misses the mark. It's not funny irreverent humour. It's juvenile and often offensive.You can argue that was the intention, and that I don't understand their target audience, but it doesn't make the sketch comedy less sketchy.

But, if I ever have to listen to Steve Gerben's over acting and whiny, high pitched voice again it will be too soon. The redeeming factor's in this showcase are the performances of Shane and Stavros. They seem to naturally fit into their character's personas and deliver a subtle, yet dry style of humor which is often derailed by the bombastic performance of the shop manager played by Steve. What made the Gilly and Keeves YouTube specials (which was this shows precursor) so great and what separates it from their Netflix anthology was its diverse character personas and broader plot elements. I think they could pull it off though as this style is reminiscent of the hugely popular and successful show: It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. In fact, I think that if they replaced Steve Gerben with actor Charley Day (or someone similar with better acting skills) from the same show it would be a huge step in the right direction.",

Gillis portrays and slovenly and crass loser who ends up working at a family tire shop, and ostensible bikinis are purported to ensue.

It's simply because Shane (the character and potentially creator) is a bad guy. I guess he was supposed to be redeemed in the last episode of the first season, but it wasn't enough. Other than this moment, he has no redeemable qualities. It's like 2008 humor, but somehow worse?",

Zooming in on Shane's facial expressions in lieu of a punchline just does not work. I am truly surprised a second season was greenlit. I am not really sure what they were going for with this show, but a raunchy blue collar comedy just does not work. Dirty jokes and excessive profanity can work with stand up, but not for a sitcom. Someone should have been honest with Shane and the other creators, and advised them to scrap the show. If you want a show that is truly funny and raunchy, then It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is the show for you.",

Luckily they didn't actually attach it to the car, but it was still an incredibly stupid detour for the episode.Second episode, the car owner is a spoiled kid who isn't even old enough to drive yet, and is about to get his license. He has no gratitude, no struggle in his life at all, so it's just a big gift to someone who totally does not deserve it, and it's hard to watch because it's so cringey. I'm all for helping people who need the help, but gifting a spoiled kid a pimped put car? No.Couldn't bother to keep watching after the first 2 episodes.

The show seems more interested in flashy editing and forced humor than in showcasing the actual process of car customization.What viewers really want to see is proper mechanics at work, meticulously tweaking and upgrading cars with skill and precision. Instead, we're given a superficial spectacle that misses the mark. The show could have been a great platform to delve into the craftsmanship and creativity involved in car modification, but it fails to deliver on this promise.In summary, if you're looking for a show that truly appreciates and highlights the art of car customization, this isn't it.

You need to NOT watch, use, consume, etc and avoid reviewing the new thing if you are determined to dislike\/hate because of unavoidable reasoning (timing and worker cannot change that too). I didn't give it a better rating because they introduce Lacey every ep, bring her in for stuff but then don't show much about the engine work, if they extended the episodes by 5 minutes then they might be able to fit more specifics for it but also it would give bad people the fuel to make worse comments so i see why it may have been made this way. I'm not a mechanic but i do have some training for this stuff & a bit of knowledge from being super curious, also great at figuring things out with context and the show seems great to me besides what i said earlier, some other things are cut short depending on the episode because of the works that are focused on for that episode but so far it works and the jobs seem well done.",

I loved that show back in the day and this is a fresh take on the old formula: take someone deserving who owns a junker, and transform it into a car like you've never seen before, matching their own individual personality.I will say, some of the stuff they put into some of these cars are bizarre (I'm looking at you, pizza launcher and grappling hook), but I love seeing the incredible rides the team comes up with. The team is fun and each member adds their own personal expertise and touch to the build that's cool to see. Plus they all have great chemistry between them which is great to see. They're the best part of the show, plus they seem great at their jobs! I also think Chris Redd is a great host, he keeps the show quick and light.A few things I'd change for future seasons: I like that they have pranks before each episode, but do feel like they need to commit to them a little more, or just not use Chris so obviously, most of them didn't pan out to be super believable, but that's not a huge deal to me. I also wish a few of the people they picked were a little more \"deserving\" of it. Obviously that's subjective, but for me picking the dog mom, for instance, felt much different than doing it for the kid who loved his grandma's old car, or the surfing teacher. Lastly, I could have done without some of the suggestive photos at the beginning when everyone was being introduced.One thing I didn't expect is that I'm actually learning a lot as I'm watching. It's fascinating to see how smart this crew is, and I liked that they explain what they're doing as they go. I would love to see more of that in future seasons!The cinematography is much better than I anticipated. The close up b-roll shots of them doing normal stuff like mixing paint, screwing bolts, etc makes it look epic. Hats off to the camera crew, as well as the editing crew. You could tell they had a blast putting these episodes together, and they didn't take themselves too seriously which I appreciate, some of the editing effects are hilarious.All in all love the show, and appreciate it's something all ages can watch on the whole.

While the series progresses he keeps you guessing as to the type of person he might be. It's easy to say in retrospect that you knew the answer all along but, honestly, he made me wonder and I really enjoyed the journey. Annette Bening also does an excellent job of portraying a woman coming to terms with the meaning of her life upon retirement. Her kids are grown and she finds herself being alone with her husband. What happens when your identity for so long has been defined by your family and your profession? Was it all worth it? I enjoyed finding out.",

Delaneys, with plenty of flashbacks that fill in present day interactions to explain why some family members react and behave the way they do.In the end, the final episode was a complete letdown, with the last 5 seconds of the penultimate episode being the biggest twist\/shocker of the series. I did not read the book, but it felt like the last episode was stretching the last couple pages of the book into a full hour of content.If you temper your expectations oso that you don't expect a big payoff to the series, and instead watch it as a family melodrama wrapped around a \"meh\" mystery, your opinion might be higher.",

But this story is about what's done in the dark, the secrets you keep, the self preservation of yourself affects your life and your family. The decisions we make alter the perspective of others. How they see us and how they see themselves. All of this plays into the telling of the story.To be honest I thought the ending was going to fall short. But it didn't. They could have however, had an eight episode entitled Savannah. The only mystery is the life and the character of Savannah which is never fully developed or shown.

It starts off as a mystery with a whole lot of family dynamics to be unfolded and explored.The show has mostly well-known, good actors and it is set in beautiful houses. But it's like a second-rate summer novel. The storyline gets a pass. No more.You keep watching it because it isn't bad enough to let it go, and because you want to know what happened, but as episodes roll on, blame is pointed to every character in a strive for plot twists and surprises that frankly make the ensemble quite ridiculous in the end.This is what is frustrating about this show. You keep going to find out why all this is happening, and when they finally have it all out in the final episode, it sounds like my twelve year old niece concocted the whole story.With such a bad story it is impossilbe to draw any interesting acting or character portrayals from the actors. Troy is pretty good, in his usual rich-prick role we know him for. But the rest, including the father, are quite forgettable.Funnily, as I look over the IMDB page, the similar shows recommended have the same problem: bad, bad, simplistic and childish storylines. Palm Royale, the Elvis Presley grand-daughter show ... a waste of good resources.But hey, if you don't really care about suspension of disbelief, you can binge watch them one after the other!",

Also, the trauma that we carry from our own childhood well into adulthood. I think most of that transferred to the mini-series and I think that it stayed true to the book. They did do a bit of a change, adding in one of the children being a homosexual. However, it didn't add nor take away from the story. I found it really interesting especially how things can change and people can condemn people without proof or conviction. I think it expressed also how parents feel as I get older with the lack of communication or respect they get from their adult children. I have to admit that I couldn't stop watching it and I've binge watching it all night. I would've liked more of a resolution that the book had, but I'm satisfied.

        "body":"This 7-part series is based on a book by an author that my wife reads and enjoys, although she had not read this particular book. While this series has a number of awkward spots in total it is interesting and entertaining story-telling. The title is a shortening of the old saying \"Apples never fall far from the tree.\" The last episode ties lots of things up and is written to show how it is important for families, parents and their adult children, to keep dialog going and not take each other for granted.Annette Bening is Joy Delaney and Sam Neill is her long-time husband Stan Delaney. Each was a tennis star in earlier days and in retirement established a successful tennis academy. As this series opens they are fairly freshly retired, having sold the academy.There is an additional character, Savannah, a stranger that shows up at their door claiming to be a victim of boyfriend abuse and Joy, being a kind person, takes her in. She quickly becomes an ex officio member of the family, to the consternation of the others. It turns out she has a key role in resolving everything.Joy and Stan have four adult children, each quite different, each with a different idea of what success in life might look like. There is an argument, the children blame Joy, won't take or return her calls under the guise of being too busy. Then Joy disappears. They find her phone in the laundry basket.This all happens in the first episode, setting up what transpires in the rest of the episodes. The whole show is presented by alternating between a \"then\" and \"now\" manner, each time it goes from one to the other script at the bottom of the frame states which it is. So we get some information, but not all, and the rest is revealed gradually. In truth it could have been a 2-hour movie but I get why it is a 7-part series, more opportunity for insertion of 1-minute commercials during each episode. Revenue is important.Joy is at first just presumed simply missing, as the days go by family and police get hints that she may in fact be no longer alive. So, much of the show is family dynamics as they search for their mother and the reasons she disappeared.My wife and I watched it streaming on Peacock over three evening, 2, 2, then 3 episodes. It is satisfyingly entertaining.The several negative reviews and \"1\" ratings are totally bogus, it is as if they didn't actually see the series.",

The show isn't bad.In fact, it's kind of funny reviews that dislike it say they gussed the ending right away, so it wasn't good, when the actual point is being able to emphasize with fallible people all thinking they're doing what's right for them and the family.

A take on the \"what if,\" of that kind of situation. The allusions continue as you begin to think of the phrase \"Apples Never Fall,\" ... \"Far from the tree,\" I believe is how that saying ends. Indeed this comes to fruition when the family ties and secrets begin to unravel slowly. Everyone has skeletons in their closets. I appreciated that, in the end, everyone was able to admit their own faults and that Joy wasn't killed off simply in the name of intrigue.All in all, the story kept me invested throughout. The use of flashbacks helped set the (albeit) slower pace. It definitely felt like an investigation unfolding, and stayed true to the limited series ideals. I enjoyed the way that the tale really made sense from both angles, and how the different POVs and flashbacks only enhanced the \"confusion,\" and drama. By the end, I was even considering a third option--maybe the father didn't kill JOY...its all very reminiscent of the \"Pretty Little Liars\" production style.As for the cast, at times I felt that there may have been too many supporting roles. I felt that Logan and Brooke were overshadowed, a lot of the time. I thought Joy was often overly naive. Stan and Troy seeming like the any people with some semblance of sense and depth at times.While not anything that will amaze, this is the perfect show to get you out of a slump when you aren't sure what to watch next. It's a total fit for someone looking for juicy family drama with some unexpected twists.

The series veers away from the main story by developing stories about the family, and boy are they a crew! Nobody I'd be proud of! On top of this an interloper who the mother (Benning) takes to, because she seems more the child she wishes she had, helpful, caring, needy. Of course the interloper is suspect #1, and Dad (Neill) is suspect #2.As a Police procedural it fails badly as the cops don't meet the respect grade, and as a family drama it putters along with little depth. The ending seemed inevitable since the plot had us all lathered up.",

The parents ran a competitive tennis camp which left each of their children with their own issues. The kids notice that their mother seems to be missing and their father seems to be lying. After four days, the police is brought in. In the past, the family gets invaded by troubled Savannah (Georgia Flood).Alison Brie is good at being a flighty mess. Sam Neill is good at being withholding. He never actually answers a question. Jake Lacy is annoyingly arrogant. This is family dysfunction at a DNA level. They're all good at their roles and none of them are that appealing. It's the same novelist as Big Little Lies and I seem to be less of a fan than most. I have similar issues with this series, but I am more willing to sit through this. It's shorter and easier on my frustrations. It's the phrase... \"All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" Some people have fun ruminating on each unhappy family. I find no particular joy in it. They could have made it better with smarter cops. Instead, they're kinda dumb and played by second tier actors. Even the smart one isn't smart.

Neill and Bening are wonderfully talented actors with impressive resumes, but I felt this was beneath them. Neill's acting was marginally acceptable and intentionally over-the-top and Bening's character was a naive idiot, and all but one of the actors playing her children were annoying entitled whiners.Regarding those four actors, the only one I felt anything for or who was the least bit convincing in his portrayal was the son with the long blond hair. I guess I'm a prude, but I felt there was also entirely too much emphasis on the lesbian subtext.Additionally, I am in complete agreement with other reviewers who felt this series could have been easily condensed into 2 or 3 episodes at MOST!Finally and most importantly, my biggest complaint is in the sheer stupidity and naïveté of Bening's character in not questioning the new supposedly domestically abused lodger and letting her live in their home without any questions or proof of her background. A ship could have been launched with the red flags thrown up by this stranger!Frankly, I disliked most of the characters' personalities so much that their names are barely memorable and the only way I could get through the 7 episodes was with occasional muting and fast forwarding.Overall, a disappointing and drawn-out letdown, especially considering the talents of Bening and Neill. The other actors except \"Troy\" were all new to me, and not the least bit impressive, except for the blonde son.",

If they did they'd be social realism (or documentaries). They're plotted for engagement and surprise, not for realism. Go and watch some old Agatha Christie adaptations (or read the books) if you want to know how that works - wildly-unrealistic, totally engaging. Or look up Hitchcock's theory of the \"refrigirator moment.\" He didn't care about believability because, like Christie, (and unlike many critics) he had a much deeper understanding of how narrative works.Also Sam Neill is doing exactly what's required of the role. He retains an ambiguity and inscrutability that's pivotal to the story. Minor critics have dismissed it as \"bad acting,\" because they're in the wrong job.In the tradition of murder mystery it also allows a very-engaging family drama to unfold, from an excellent cast.A worthy addition to Liane Moriarty's fine body of work.",

It was well paced with interesting plot twists and I've thought the ending was better than expected. Sam Neill and Annette Benning are of course legends but the support cast were impressive and I found all the characters to be interesting in their own different way. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a short series that is going to keep your guessing up to the end. The flashbacks really added to the presentation of the drama so that we could see how things were then and now.",

Simply the best.The worst: The couple's four grown \"children.\" All four are spoiled, privileged, annoying humans. Their perspectives of life are dull and pampered.

It had 3 top of line actors in Gael Garcia Bernal, Diego Luna and the incredibly beautiful Eiza Gonzalez. Bernal and Luna have worked together several times and you can see the chemistry the two have, this is probably their best work together and that's saying something. I wouldn't be surprised to see this win some awards come award season. It currently has a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes so the critics love it as much as the audience does. I can't believe how few reviews there are. Most of it is in subtitles so that scares away some people. Don't let it though because this series is worth watching, subtitles or not.

But in one of La Máquina first fights his manager made a deal for his opponent to throw the fight, unbeknownst to La Máquina.

Maybe he's supposed to be a cartoon? The production has an upbeat pace and intensity, which works for the most part, but when the two lead actors (GGB and DL) happen to be great friends in real life, it can sometimes work against them. In one scene, their rapport is snappy and slick, and it looks like they could rest on their laurels. Consequently, the supposed tension between their characters comes off as false.

The story is just actually that shocking.So many themes are present that are timely in today's world - the myth that all adoption stories are full of hope and positivity; the way women in abusive marriages are brainwashed to ignore, deny and defend the abuser's behaviour; how the policing and justice system fails missing, abused and murdered women every single day.The 'reenactment' B-roll scenes were cheesy and unnecessary, and the format would have been better split into 4 shorter episodes, as the two halves both felt like they had natural split points.

Along the way they have captured the unique elements that only the long-game can reveal. Those elements, each of them, are often pain-infused, frustrating, and even highly unlikely to cohere into a kind of final resolution and justice.

It's quite evident that an unfit couple adopted Cathys daughter. The husband had a history of sexual assault charges, had spent time in prison and interesting part is that no one listened to this 14 year old girl when she complained to adults about the abuse and molestation she was facing at home.",

The documentary was so well done , it draws you in every minute ...you think you know the next clue but you don't because the story is unbelievable! The love and determination of the that woman was amazing given all the setbacks and time passed.

I have no clue how others came to that conclusion. The documentary was not even made until years after the events unfolded. As soon as she found out Aundria\/Alexis was missing, she dedicated TEN years to finding out the truth. I'm sick at the number of people who are saying awful things about the bio mother. Cathy: you are an inspiration and a rockstar!Brenda: you totally suck.Watch this documentary, it's VERY well researched and is thorough.",

Normally these \" True Crime \" documentaries get short shrift from me , as their exposition is always very obvious . Not so here , by quite some considerable distance I might add . The story of a mother and the daughter ( she gave up for adoption after her birth ) that then goes missing from her adoptive parents is very neatly and chronologically set out ; Cathy ( the birth mother ) , after many years of soul searching , decides to try and trace her lost daughter and what unfolds is nothing short of astonishing. It's very rare that I get caught on my heels more than once, but this story has to be witnessed to be believed .",

        "body":"Into the fire: the lost daughter, a Netflix film, can easily be classified as another excessive true-crime documentary, bearing in mind the alarming story of Aundria Bowman's disappearance. Cathy Terkanian, Aundria's maternal figure, drives the series as she attempts to get to the bottom of things a betrayal and great injustice lies.The documentary's quality is best indicated by its unrestrained and simply involving narrative structure. Their combination, coupled with the series and Katie's persistence, keeps the audience on their toes. The harsh realities of the case, such as claims of abuse and manipulation, are not glossed over by the series.The documentary is interesting; however, some audiences may think that some parts of the story are prolonged. Also, the story is cut off so that there are one or two lingering story threads that eases the audience into the ending, but they really want the ending to be tighter.With those small points, 'Into the fire: the lost daughter\" is a suitable content for children who love true crime. It is also a heartwarming story about a mother's love that transcends time and the barriers she would go through to keep her child safe.",

        "body":"Meet Cathy Terkanian: She is an imperfect hero. Your first impression might be that she is a little annoying. But your second impression won't be any better. She's immediateIy abrasive, brash, over the top. I almost didn't watch past the first few minutes. But something about her, something invisible, captivated me, and so I didn't turn it off. And by the end, I found myself admiring her. Even respecting her - for doing what no one else in the school system, the church, or law enforcement had been able to do for more than thirty-five years.For the next two-plus hours she walks us through one of the most unbelievable and riveting mysteries imaginable. A runaway at 16 from a difficult home life, and then pregnant, she gives up her daughter for adoption to a childless couple and the promise of a better life for her baby. Twenty years go by and one day, out of nowhere, she receives a letter from a police department asking her for a DNA sample in the hopes that it might match with that of an unidentified Jane Doe found murdered in a cornfield. What then unfolds is Cathy's jaw-dropping journey to uncover the mystery of what happened to the daughter she gave up. This story won't go where you think it's going to go. Instead, it will go everywhere else. And lead back to where it began.Cathy Terkanian is a determined person. Her story, and the story of her daughter, is unlike anything anyone has ever heard, or imagined. And had it not turned out the way it did, she would have faded into obscurity as a nutcase, a crackpot and a stalker.This documentary is compelling and will put your heart in your throat and keep it there all the way to its semi-satisfying finale.",

This whole show is to exonerate her from her guilt. Look at little Aundria - that little angelic face. No way is it even possible to give that baby up. I'd rather eat a crust of bread and water than ever do that. And I don't care who is judging me here for these words. To hold that little girl for months; to look at the trust in her eyes, see her gummy smile then give her away like she was a used piece of furniture. I'm judging Cathy terribly here, but all I saw were crocodile tears. At sone points during the documentary she was laughing at her victory. I didn't see heartache. I cried more than her. It was sickening to watch. It was a showboating fest of glory that she was so right about that poor child being in the ground. A mother's gut feeling, she said. How about a gut feeling during the twenty years that poor child lay in the ground and you never thought to go and seek her out.Re the monster and the pathetic, snivelling wife. She made me squirm more than him. \"I still love you\" dear god... how! How do you grovel like that after knowing that scum bag beat up and murdered a beautiful newlywed (and how many more we don't know about) and then undoubtedly did the same to his own daughter because let's face it, there is no way in HELL she died from being \"accidentally\" pushed down the stairs.The show was excellent in its narration, but sickening that there are vile, utterly vile human beings out there and women are so at risk. It stayed with me a long, long time. Aundria, you are in my heart you poor darling abandoned angel.",

The fact that our system of adoption in this country and the vetting that goes into finally getting an approval along side the fact that the people who were responsible for the wellbeing of this child, from literal cradle to her grave failed her is beyond comprehension.

        "body":"This true crime documentary tells the story of a mother whose child has been missing for ten years. While it's well-executed and visually compelling, at its core, the narrative feels like just another one in the endless stream of missing child stories. The mother abandoned her daughter, and now her obsession with the case seems driven less by genuine grief and more by some strange fixation.What makes this even harder to digest is the broader context-thousands of children go missing every day. Her daughter wasn't different from the others, and the fact that she barely even knew her child makes the whole situation feel forced. There's a disturbing parallel to another documentary where a delusional woman refuses to call her child by their real name, obsessively insisting on \"D-MAN\" instead. It's almost as if the mother here is more attached to the idea of the drama than the child herself.Even more troubling is the fact that despite eventually being right by sheer chance, the mother spent a significant amount of time harassing a couple. Imagine what could've happened if she had been wrong-she could have been sued for her reckless behavior. There's a line where relentless pursuit of a cause turns into blind, harmful obsession, and this film crosses it. At some point, it stops being about finding justice and starts feeling like a spectacle.",

        "body":"I must say first that I am a huge lover of reality shows. I even produce and direct my own so that genre holds a particular fascination for me. There are so many now that it's difficult to watch them all but I really try to experience as many as possible.I always give a new show the chance to develop and my feelings might evolve over time but for now, I get a very bad feeling about this one. It is obviously inspired by Vanderpump Rules and my guess is that Lisa Vanderpump is hoping it will become must see TV.But in order for that to happen, some serious fixes are needed. So far, the only ones I like are Anthony the chef, Andre the barman, server Priscila and Stephen the event coordinator. They are real, entertaining yet not prone to extreme behavior that never fails to make my skin crawl.The others in the cast are still an open question for me to find out if I will like them in the long run. But the two most obnoxious, cliched and unbearable characters are without a doubt Eric the manager who is an absolute monster of arrogance and Marciano the eternal frat boy who will most likely never change.Eric is by far the absolute worst one in the bunch. He is prickly, smug and pretentious. I understand that he is the manager but the way he goes about it is insane. I find him unwatchable to the point that when he talks in his confessionals, I fast forward because I can't stand what he says and the cocky way he says it.Marciano is the typical jerk who goes around drinking like he's on a Vegas bender. Hannah is his insecure ex who still loves him and we can see a mile away that their road to get back together will be filled with toxic confrontations already teased as the season will progress.But the thing that really disappoints me about this show is Lisa. At the beginning, she establishes her rules which make perfect sense one of which is to not drink on the job. Well, that rule is broken within minutes obviously along with several others yet, Eric and Marciano drink constantly and antagonize every other person in the cast but Lisa doesn't do anything to stop it.I understand that most reality shows think they need at least one or two villains to stir things up but the fun for an audience is to see the bad apple being properly chastised and punished. Yet Lisa doesn't intervene when they break her own rules and the show devolves into yet another circus of toxic personalities who drink, make bad decisions and so far suffer no consequences.The show is still in its infancy and the previews are showing us that there might be repercussions for the culprits but I can't help but agree with chef Anthony who says that in any normal restaurant, half the staff would be fired already.The toxicity is already so high and as I write this, only 4 episodes are released so I am not hopeful that this will get any better. I will pretty much watch any reality show but at some point I feel like this one will lose me if the people who need to be called out on their behavior are free to roam in this debacle eventually making it unwatchable. Let's hope that some sense will prevail and that Lisa will admonish the ones who deserve it.Any show needs a grace period and I am willing to stick around to find out but if by the end of the season nothing changes, I won't be returning for season 2. A bit of drama is fine but toxicity to this level is just not sustainable and frankly, not even remotely entertaining.",

Do you know how many restaurants she has been responsible for all over the world?

I became acquainted with them (as a viewer) when they were regular cast members of \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" for multiple seasons (since its inception) and I truly missed their presence once they decided to leave the show and move onto other ventures. The show did lose some luster after their departure.But - back to their ventures! On the show, they fought for and had legislation enacted regarding the cruel and grossly inhumane Yulin dog festival in China. I will never forget Ken's tear-filled face after he saw a video on the BHOBH of what took place in that disgusting festival. There is NO way I could have had the wherewithal to watch it.Additionally, Lisa and Ken have numerous restaurants that they have developed over the years and in which they take an active role. Although I never watched \"Vanderpump Rules,\" I followed Lisa (and Ken) on other shows like Vanderpump Dogs and another show where Lisa was the judge of a dog-grooming program. (I'm sorry but I forgot the name.\"Back to this program, what a pleasant surprise it was. Lisa does a wonderful job working with her employees and though they are not in MY age group, I found them mostly adorable, especially Andre and Steven. It was nice to see Ken at some of the dinners at the Chateau. The show is still active and a few episodes remaining, but I hope there are more shows like this in the future with Lisa and Ken!Finally, the fact that Ken and Lisa have been an enduring couple and wonderful supportive parents all these years, what a breath of fresh air in this day and age of divorce and acrimony. Keep up the fantastic work, Ken and Lisa. I wish I could meet you and I loved sweet Giggy all those fun RHOBH years - God bless him. Donut is adorable!!!! Take care and carry on, you adorable couple!",

        "body":"On the 1st day of cakemas my true love gave to me, 9 bakers from previous seasons of Is It Cake competing against each other by creating the best illusion cakes to win a jackpot which is unfortunately quite a bit smaller than in the previous seasons of Is It Cake?On the 2nd day of cakemas my true love gave to me a first round called Find that Cake where the bakers are faced with a Christmas themed room that looks like it's full of everyday objects but at least one of those objects is cake. And the Baker who guesses which object is cake the fastest gets to choose which bakers they are competing against and what item they will try to make their illusion cake look like.On the 3rd day of cakemas my true love gave to me a 2nd round where you see the how much skill and uniquely delicious flavours the bakers put into making these illusion cakes. The cakes are then put amongst some decoys and it's up to 3 judges to try to guess which object is really cake. After 3 seasons you would think that they could get judges that had at least a little baking or food tasting knowledge but unfortunately the judges are minor celebrities that are sometimes funny but you've probably never heard of them. The winner of this round is the baker whose cake fools the judges, if more than one baker fools the judges, they will decide which baker is the winner by choosing which cake is the most tasty and which looks most like an everyday object. Then unfortunately the 2 losers of this round are elimated. This means that there are only 4 episodes in this season which means there's not nearly enough cake to go around, but it does make it's the perfect length for you to binge through on Christmas or Boxing Day after all the festivities are over.I like these 2 rounds because you can play along at home and try to guess which object is cake. Even in the 2nd round where you get to see how the cakes are made it's still quite difficult to guess which object is real.On the 4th day of cakemas my true love gave to me a 3rd round called Cake or Cash where the winner of the 2nd round is faced with 9 winter and\/or Christmas themed objects, 3 of which are cakes. If the baker manages to find one cake they win $2,000 and $8,000 is added to the final jackpot, if they find 2 cakes they win $5,000 and $5,000 is added to the final jackpot and if they find 3 cakes they win $10,000 and unfortunately no money is added to the final jackpot. This means there are more opportunities for you to play cake or cash at home and more opportunities to add to the final jackpot which starts off at $25,000. This is a substantial amount of money but not nearly as big as in the previous seasons. This unfortunately makes the season a bit less exciting but still a good addition to the Is It Cake show that I would gladly watch again.",

        "body":"Simone Biles is likely the most famous gymnast of all time with five skills named after her. At 27-years-old, she has two past Olympics under her belt heading into the 2024 Paris games with seven Olympic medals and the first part of her Netflix documentary series shows her incredible journey of those games.Biles drew headlines when she unexpectedly withdrew from the 2020 Tokyo games after a few rough landings in a row, stating her mental health wasn't in a good place. There has been plenty of speculation and rumors surrounding the events going on around that time, and there were a surprising number of people who were hostile and awful about it.This series finally gives the gymnast the space to talk about her own experiences and her own story for the first time, as well as bring in some other professionals from before her time to fill in blanks and articulate how the sport has changed over time. Given that Simone was one of the victims of Larry Nassar, I was a little concerned going into the documentary because I wasn't sure if further details about that case were going to be discussed, but they are not. Instead, Biles focuses on her own journey, the people who failed her, and how she is healing.My only hesitancy about recommending this series is that I felt like it could have been longer! I'm glad to know this is only the beginning and there are future installments about her coming soon! This series also was perfectly timed in its release, right before the Olympics begin so I feel 100% prepared to watch the games and cheer her on!",

Don't expect any earth-shattering insights or nuggets of wisdom because this is true crime lite. There is nothing more to glean in these episodes than if we were to simply read about the events as reported in the news.Some of these events are so recent, like episode 1, that it makes it impossible to invite further comment and investigation by forensic experts and psychiatrists without risking a lawsuit as there are still living members in the immediate family of the perpetrators, who may object to being cast in an unflattering light. But it is really true crime if the motivations and machinations of unhinged people like Benjamin Foster are not explored at all?How did Ben turn out the way he did? What was his childhood like? How was his relationship with his parents? What did his brother have to say about their experiences growing up together? Why didn't his parents seem more upset when spoken to about him being on the run? Could they have done more to intervene after his initial brush with the law or did they not care enough to? What skeleton in the closet is his family hiding? When he misdirected his rage and sadism at the women, who in his mind was he really lashing out at? All of these questions and not a single answer.There is also a curious absence of reflection from those affected by these malevolent characters. What lessons did they learn from their experience and how has their ex affected the way they view the world or interact with others? What advice or recommendations do they have for anyone who should find themselves in the same unfortunate predicament of facing a toxic partner?",

It brought together all those affected, the spouses and their families, got them to talk about the events in great detail, yet somehow neglected to even ask them what they learnt from these \"worst ex ever\"s and how their experience has changed their perspectives. It takes four episodes for someone to even describe coercive control. The other people like the police and DAs don't discuss domestic violence or what people should do if they ever find their prince or princess turning into a toxic toad. So the series is basically DV porn with little educational value.And I just have to add how people who rate this voyeuristic garbage highly seem to have experienced domestic violence themselves, and somehow find solace and validation in watching the depiction of others' misfortunes. They also tend to conveniently ignore that men can suffer from domestic violence too (see episode 3) and this tends to be underreported because they don't appear as credible as battered women. Bad parenting produces both tormented sons and daughters, who then bring their distorted perceptions into their relationships.

I came into the show after I discovered Katseye. I personally loved building a deeper appreciation for the newly formed group.Some aspects were slow. The competition itself does not start until episode 5, and the first 4 episodes consist of the training before the competition starts. This makes you build a connection with the girls that have been there at the beginning of the bootcamp.I've only watched singing competitions; I like this more. It takes a lot of dedication and hard work to be in a girl group and this shows that hard work. The show also displays how dedication and hard work are the basics. There are 5 categories to consider such as Dancing, Singing, and Star Quality. This becomes more prevalent when the girls start to compete against each other. Unfortunately, the girls don't really understand until the competition really starts.Is it cruel? Maybe, but the audience needs to decide it for themselves. The twists may push some girls over the edge. I was on the edge of my seat due to twists and cliffhangers. Despite knowing who makes the group I did have the occasional trainee that I was secretly rooting for. You'll never see the twists coming.Just like any competition\/reality show, there's gonna be drama. It's easy to pick a side but every result has an underlying reason.Overall:\nI liked the perspective and execution of the show. In the end, despite already knowing the results, I was crying for one of my favs that didn't get in. It really takes you through all of the emotions and perspectives, so if you feel a certain way then this show did its thing. I wasn't planning on crying but the music and timing really had me crying then happy for all of my favorites. If I could rank on making me feel something alone it would be a 10\/10. However, the show is slow. I think it's valid to criticize the show for not telling the trainees it was as a competition show until the 5th episode. Then I go back to loving how intentional every aspect of the show was. I really only removed 1 star because I wish episode 1 started with the competition versus the very beginning of this training bootcamp. The title of the show is accurate, but I wish it was just \"PopStar Competition\". Or, \"Popstar Academy to Competition\", which is wordy but is more accurate to the show. Instead it focused on the origins on Katseye. It's easy to be confused by the rules for each mission but I recommend making sure you understand the rules before watching the elimination rounds or you might find things unfair. Again, everything is intentional.Shoutout to the Philippines 🇵🇭",

This is a lesson on how NOT to build a lasting global pop group.",

        "body":"This series amounts to an 8 episode advertisement for a new global K-Pop band. The documentary makers retain some integrity for not shying away completely from the cruelty of the process the girls were put through, but ultimately they seem to have made several editorial decisions intended to soften those cruel edges.The filmmakers can't be blamed for the awful management of the project at the heart of the show, but you do detect a deliberate decision to refrain from tarnishing the image of HYBE and Geffen Records too much (the music megacorps behind what can only be describe as an extended theatre of cruelty performance), lest Netflix not be invited back for another season.The show follows an international group of very young women (14-21), as they're put through a two year training camp for what they think will be an internal selection process by the record label to create a new 'global' k-pop group, only to discover that they've signed up to a 'survivor show' at the end of it to decide the final members of the band. A 'survivor show' is the K-Pop version of the old TV pop talent shows from the west like 'Popstars' franchise - but conspicously more sinister.Many of the girls come from clearly disenfranchised backgrounds (including one girl who is a refugee), however little is made of this by the producers, who give everyone's backstory a few glossy unsentimental minutes. Only one of the girls gets a huge amount of backstory - and even then it's all very superficial.Nothing is explained in regards to income for the girls, we don't know if they're being paid during this years long process (some of the girls mention having no money as they pack their hopes and dreams into suitcases after being ejected from the program).We also never linger over what these very young girls are giving up to be here, one girl mentions taking her place as a trainee has prevented her from graduating high school - but this is treated as nothing more than a funny anecdote, and no further enquiries are made.Equally, a discussion between the girls about being away from home - in which one girl admits not being able to speak to her family for weeks - simply drifts by onscreen, unexplored.Perhaps the most obvious of these attempts to shield HYBE and Geffen Records from public scrutiny regarding the cruelty of the process, comes at the expense of what would otherwise be a rather critical scene for a show like this.Once the girls have made it to the 'public' survivor show part of the process, they take part in three elimination rounds which are judged partially (and it is only very partially) by members of the public.The elimination scene for the first round is heartbreaking, the second elimination scene is harrowing, and the third elimination scene was presumably so brazenly vicious that it's given the 'off screen death' treatment, where we skip from the girls arriving to hear whether or not they've wasted the last two years of their girlhood from a disembodied voice on a television screen, to a montage of the survivors tearfully calling their loved ones to report their Kpop dreams are still alive - giving strong disaster survivor vibes.Yet there is a slightly less obvious, but none the less very telling detail in the documentary that belies the filmmakers obedience to the HYBE\/Geffen machine - the lack of follow up.Unlike other Netflix shows following a bunch of kids as they try to achieve their dreams in time limited settings (Cheer competitions, Basketball finals, Football drafts) - after the final 6 have been picked, and the credits start to roll - we do not get the usual 'where are they now' pre-credit closure snippets of the one's who didn't make it on the show. Indeed, it seems, that like the rest of the whole show, the ending is an exercise in minimisation and distraction - nudging the audience not to think about the brutality of the process, rather to just enjoy the shiny happy teens who've emerged victorious from a process none of them fully understood they were consenting to when they skipped over the small print in their application forms.The access the producers had for the documentary could have been used for that most noble of documentary pursuits - making tangible change in the world. It would have taken barely any effort to turn their footage into an expose that could have led to mass calls for reform in an industry that consistently exploits minors.Instead, hemmed in buy cowardice and perhaps corporate interest too, the filmmakers leave their audience with an uneasy sense of being complicit in an extended episode of emotional and financial abuse - without our concent, much like the girls featured in the show.",

Which is astounding but also kind of spooky, as they become a commodity while also something young girls across the globe aspire to copying.On the show, the girls all have language for emotions they have, without the actual knowledge of those emotions, as they're too young and influenced by social media to do other than copy what they hear online. It's not their fault; it's what they've learnt. And they need to know in order to be on this kind of show.

        "body":"A group of talented but naive hopefuls from around the world consent to giving away up to two years of their life to a multinational music conglomeration intent on melding them into an international, cohesive, KPop-style girl group. Though contracts and NDAs were signed by all, apparently not a single participant bothered to have an attorney look over the contracts or have them explained. Apparently, they each took the promise of, \"Baby, I'm gonna make you a STAR!\" at face value and didn't consider the potential price that each would have to pay. Have they never been taught that \"All that glitters is not gold,\" or the clear winner when you make a deal to \"sell your soul\"?Besides the giant spiderweb these ingenues become ensnared within, I was immediately struck by the lack of professionalism of (what I call) \"the camp counselors\", particularly the woman in charge, who actually wept with emotion when speaking to the initial group of 14 hopefuls. Her way of speaking, with many of her declarations\/statements are made with an upturn at the end, making each sound like questions. Her manner of presents herself in frumpy clothes, slumped posture, and offering little eye contact when communicating, doesn't inspire confidence in her abilities or authority, either. Her sister, the professional dancer (the \"fiery\" one), is far more self-assured and confident, and she deals with the girls with authority and clear(er) expectations.We're given few details about the girls other than some carefully-curated backstories. For example, which girls are homesick? Is school provided for the minors? Which girls are with \"guardians\"\/parents and which ones are in the house? What does a typical day look like: how many hours spent dancing? Singing? Presenting? Have the girls been instructed on cultivating a unique persona? How disciplined is each girl, really? How reliable? How many dance routines did they have to learn? How do they afford to go out? Who pays for personal grooming? What about conflict amongst the participants? Feelings of jealousy? I can't be the only viewer alarmed by the story told by one of the younger girls' \"guardian\", which goes something like this: While lurking around a random performance event (a pageant or dance recital), she happened across a most charismatic and talented child of about 6 or 7 years old, whom, she was convinced, could become a star, but only under her own tutelage and Hollywood connections. Somehow, this fairy godmother convinced the child's parent\/s to sign over guardianship and move her to Hollywood. We're never told what the fairy godmother was getting out of the deal (other than unfettered access to a young child, obviously), nor when her (skeevy) partner came into the picture. If *I* want to know details like this, others do, too.I also take issue with the editing (which, granted, must have been a monumental task): each episode covers such huge gaps in time that it's difficult for the viewer to know where we are in the story. For example: how did a foot fracture heal in the blink of an eye? What did the injured do during the six weeks+ of recovery: practice her voice for the entire six weeks? How on earth did she catch up with the dance routines? Did she receive physical therapy? Who paid the medical bill? I can't imagine you can get out of a boot and be back to new, let alone start back with daily training in heels.While I fully appreciate the immense talent and importance of dancers, singers, athletes, and other performers, making this one's profession is usually folly. What percentage of dancers can support themselves without help? There is simply too much talent and too few opportunities in a field where you're a single injury away from catastrophic failure. Even if you're one of the \"lucky ones\" who escape an acute\/devastating injury, the toll dancing\/sport takes on a body can't be overstated. We only get one. In professions where the competition is so extreme, corruption is bound to occur; how can it possibly be otherwise? Also, the career lifespan of a dancer is self-limiting: how many professional dancers are there over the age of, say, 35?I couldn't help compare this show with the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders (DCC) documentary: as weird and culty the DCC seem to be, I was endlessly impressed by the level of excellence, professionalism, and commitment displayed by every participant of the DCC, from top to bottom. In contrast, \"The Making of a Pop Star\" (MPS) feels like Amateur Hour, like no one really knows what they're doing (save the Chairman and the recording expert). Like the DCC, the MPS participants work around the clock with no days off, and for a pittance, if anything. In both cases, riches are never promised, only fame.In situations like MPS or DCC, the ONLY people who stand to profit are the producers at the top: the performers are truly nothing more than dancing monkeys, performing not even for riches, but merely for the promise of fame. Talk about a deal with the devil! Fame neither fills your belly nor keeps you warm at night; it's both fleeting AND a double-edged sword. Did no one warn these girls?",

Since then, I have been returning to the topic from time to time, listening to podcasts on the subject and generally being interested in new facts in the investigation. I've watched a lot of documentaries on the subject, listened to podcasts, and even read books, so I had to see this documentary as well. Was it possible to create a complete film about this monster in human skin this time?No. But it doesn't matter at all, because this film is very close to being a perfect summary of a long-term investigation for those who have been following the case for a long time, and at the same time to be a shortcut for those who only know about Zodiac from David Fincher's film.So why did the film get a 7\/10 from me and not a 9\/10, if it is \"almost perfect\"? Because in my opinion it is too fictionalized. There are too many unnecessary stories, too many digressions and asking questions, and not enough accurate presentation of the facts about Zodiac.Nevertheless, it is worth watching this film to judge for yourself whether the way it is presented suits your taste. For me, it was slightly too long for the amount of information it gives. It could easily have had two episodes instead of three, if only those genre scenes, which did not add much to the film, were abandoned.",

There is no way to confirm anything they're saying. Their testimony would be useless in a court of law.What the series leaves out is ANY speculation the Zodiac could be anyone other than Arthur Leigh Allen. What they also leave out is the considerable amount of physical evidence that Allen was NOT the Zodiac.Allen gave two handwriting samples with both hands, since he was ambidextrous. They were studied by a number of handwriting experts. Both samples came up NOT a match. The ballistic tests of all of Allen's guns came back negative to the bullets found in the murders. The bloody fingerprints that were on the taxicab of Paul Stine were NOT a match. The partial palm print that was lifted off one of the confirmed Zodiac letters was NOT a match. Finally, the partial DNA sample off one the stamps on one of the confirmed Zodiac letters ruled out Arthur Leigh Allen. In short. While there may be a lot of circumstantial evidence pointing to Allen as the Zodiac. There is substantial amount of physical evidence he was NOT.This docuseries was not good investigative journalism. It worked backward from the producer's chosen suspect and left out anything that contradicted its main theory.The Zodiac case remains unsolved and this docuseries did nothing to bring it closer to a solution.",

When it involves infamous criminals, such cases take on a life of their own and they want the mystery to continue.

        "body":"This Is the Zodiac Speaking dives into the chilling narrative surrounding the infamous Zodiac Killer, a case that has captivated true crime enthusiasts for decades. The film offers a blend of historical drama and psychological intrigue, but while it shines in some areas, it also has notable shortcomings that prevent it from being a standout entry in the genre.The Good1. Intriguing Subject Matter: The film's exploration of the Zodiac Killer case is both fascinating and chilling. The storyline effectively captures the terror that gripped California in the late 1960s and early 1970s, engaging viewers who are intrigued by true crime and unsolved mysteries. The film shines in its ability to portray the societal impact of the killings and the ensuing panic, making it a compelling watch for fans of the genre.2. Strong Performances: The cast delivers impressive performances, particularly those portraying the investigators and victims. Their ability to convey the fear, urgency, and determination surrounding the case adds depth to the narrative. The interactions among characters provide insight into the psychological toll the investigation takes on those involved, enhancing the film's emotional weight.3. Atmospheric Cinematography: The cinematography captures the essence of the era beautifully. The film's moody lighting and careful attention to detail transport viewers back in time, immersing them in the late 1960s setting. This atmospheric quality enhances the tension, making the viewer feel the pervasive dread and anxiety that characterized the time.4. Engaging Narrative Style: The film employs a storytelling structure that intertwines various perspectives, providing a well-rounded view of the investigation. This multi-faceted approach not only keeps the audience engaged but also emphasizes the different ways the Zodiac case impacted the lives of those involved, from law enforcement to the victims' families.The Bad1. Pacing Issues: One of the most significant drawbacks of This Is the Zodiac Speaking is its uneven pacing. Certain segments feel drawn out, which can detract from the suspense and momentum. Viewers may find themselves losing interest during slower scenes that interrupt the narrative flow, potentially diminishing the overall tension that the film aims to create.2. Factual Inaccuracies: While the film strives to stay true to the Zodiac case, some critics point out factual inaccuracies or embellishments that may frustrate true crime purists. These deviations from the actual events can lead to confusion for viewers unfamiliar with the case and may detract from the film's credibility for those who are well-versed in the history.3. Lack of Resolution: Given the nature of the Zodiac Killer case-one that remains officially unresolved-some viewers may find the film's conclusion unsatisfying. The lack of a definitive ending can leave audiences with a sense of ambiguity that may not resonate with all viewers, especially those seeking closure in their cinematic experiences.4. Character Development: While the performances are commendable, some characters lack the depth necessary for viewers to form a strong emotional connection. The film could have benefited from further exploration of the personal lives and motivations of key figures, which would have added complexity to the narrative and enhanced viewer investment.Overall ImpressionThis Is the Zodiac Speaking offers a gripping look at one of history's most notorious true crime cases, bolstered by strong performances and an atmospheric setting. However, pacing issues, factual inaccuracies, and a lack of resolution may leave some viewers wanting more. If you're a fan of true crime stories and appreciate the historical context, this film is worth a watch, but be prepared for a narrative that doesn't fully deliver on its potential. Ultimately, it stands as a moderately engaging film that, while intriguing, doesn't quite reach the heights of greatness one might hope for in a story of such chilling significance.",

If this guy did all this to those interviewed, making these seventy year olds refer to this suspected murderous child predator as \"Mr. Allen\" countless times is cheap, annoying, unnatural and wrong. I get the emotional play of making it seem that they're victims of a trusted adult. But, it's stupid and ruins the movie. The director deserves a talking to about this. FAIL.Otherwise it's a reasonable summary of a tragedy but let's face it, as with other docudramas that have a one-sided set up and seriously examine no contrarian positions, I can't buy their story when this stupid emotional technique is forced on those unfortunate enough to know \"Mr. Allen.\"",

        "body":"Arthur Leigh Allen was a prominent suspect in the Zodiac Killer investigation; however, several key pieces of evidence suggest he was not the perpetrator:Handwriting Analysis: The Zodiac Killer's letters were extensively analyzed, and experts concluded that Allen's handwriting did not match that of the Zodiac. Even considering his ambidexterity, samples from both hands failed to correspond with the Zodiac's writing style.Fingerprints and Palm Prints: Fingerprints and palm prints recovered from Zodiac crime scenes and letters did not match Allen's. This discrepancy undermines the theory of his involvement.DNA Evidence: In 2002, DNA analysis was conducted on saliva from stamps and envelopes used by the Zodiac. The partial DNA profile obtained did not match Allen's DNA, further distancing him from the crimes.Eyewitness Descriptions: Surviving victims and witnesses provided descriptions of the Zodiac that did not align with Allen's physical appearance. For instance, Officer Donald Fouke, who possibly saw the Zodiac fleeing a crime scene, noted that Allen was about 100 pounds heavier than the man he observed.Alibi and Lack of Direct Evidence: Allen claimed to have been elsewhere during some of the Zodiac attacks, and no direct evidence, such as possession of the murder weapons or items belonging to the victims, was ever found linking him to the crimes.",

        "body":"This is an outstanding documentary on the events surrounding the Earps and the Clantons. I have read and watched plenty of books and documentaries about the events and this still provided new facts I never heard. This is not a straight documentary as they have actors playing the roles in little vignettes of the events. They all do a very commendable job of giving a human touch to the events. Ed Harris is a fantastic narrator. He is not just reading the script.He uses various inflections in his voice to provide either humor or tension to the events he is narrating. He needs to do more of this kind of voicework. Where this show really shines is taking a very broad approach to the the events and discussing outside factors that led to the conflict. Some of these are the hurt feelings still being held by the South after the Civil War, America's debt from the war, trying to pay off that debt with silver from Arizona, said silver getting hijacked by stage coach robbers, J. P Morgan trying to get investors in England to give him loans to buy up the railroads, the recent assassination of President Garfield, Wells Fargo bankrolling Wyatt's Vendetta Ride until it becomes too scandalous, and, finally, the impression people in the East were getting of the West based on the inflammatory news articles in the New York and Washington D. C. papers. President Arthur even sent General Sherman to Arizona to determine if the violence was getting out of hand. Hint: It was. The gunfight at the OK Corral and the aftermath were not happening in a vacuum. They were affecting events all the way to Washington and Europe.All of this is handled with pinpoint storytelling. Each of the six episode focuses on a different aspect of events. In the first episode you get the backstory to include how Tombstone came to exist, the climate in America post-Civil War, and the background on the Earps' and Clantons' conflict. Then you get an episode dealing with the OK Corral gunfight and the alternate views of both sides. There is an entire episode on the preliminary hearing trying the Earps for murder. This was fascinating and the best part of part of the series IMO, as most of the movies skip right over or give very little attention to the details of how close the Earps came to hanging. Ike Clanton comes across as a pretty sly and wily opponent rather than a drunken fool like he is portrayed in the movies. Yes, he drank, but he was also ingenious at times in how he manipulated the press and the townfolk.The one negative I found in this show is the way they completely ignored Johnny Ringo. He is not even mentioned. Michael Biehn deserved better. Haha.I binged this entire series last night as I could not wait for the next episode. A very well done series that deserves to be watched by anyone who enjoys historical documentaries.",

The slick editing, great music and scenes which frankly wouldn't look out of place in \"Deadwood\", Wyatt Earp and the Cowboy War pulls you in and keeps you there.It feels like watching The Defiant Ones for the first time, knowing that what you are watching is redefining a genre.Ed Harris's narration is spot on, casual and humorous, keeping the story going in a nearly 'telling you over a beer' kind of a way. Meanwhile the cut scenes are lavish, cinematic and captivating.The guy who plays Wyatt Earp (Tim Fellingham) is the perfect casting to counter Ed's chilled vibe as he blasts his way through the west with a quick draw and a chilling stare.

Of course if your only knowledge of this era and series of events is \"Tombstone\", then I imagine this series is pretty interesting. I thought the attempts to tie the story into larger political and social frameworks was a little heavy handed and honestly not backed up by any historical documentation. They mention a lot of sources but never show them or quote directly from them. They also present Wyatt and the Earps as well intentioned lawmen driven to violence. Wyatt sent his common law wife to another stat and then \"forgot\" to join her there when he ran off with another woman. He was suspected of occasionally pumping and it's known that he roughed up rivals of political figures that befriended or paid him. Maybe not out-and-out evil but not the hero of the story.Overall it was a fun watch but I'd be cautious about accepting any of it as historical fact.",

It's two men riding into town on their horses. The one on the right was wearing a bowler hat (Lord Bowler), and the one on the right was wearing tan clothing with a tan cowboy hat (Brisco County Jr\n). It's a scene from The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. That appeared on Saturday mornings when I was a kid.I had no idea that Earp's story had more to it than just the gun fight and the ensuing push for revenge. The real history makes for a much more compelling story.",

And couldn't name one if you paid me... well... maybe Dances With Wolves counts?But I do like documentaries and since this kept popping up for me I decided to watch it and am so glad I did.It's a bit long and slow. But I believe that's purposeful and more of a comment as to how ADD we all are these days expecting things to be fast.The writing is spectacular and it is very possible the best thing about this is the narration. It's wonderful. It is interesting, clever and funny. It is informative and god help us, timely. This country has always been crazy and this documentary shows we were crazy in the late 19th century.I think in part because I've never been interested in \"The Wild West\" I came to this totally uninformed. I had no idea there had been a \"President Chester Arthur\"! I found the focus of this documentary (post gunfight) fascinating.The acting seemed okay (I dislike people who smoke so I found myself cringing a bit with the shots of men blowing smoke from their mouths). I was pretty unfamiliar with all the actors and they seemed fine. The scenery is nice. Nothing mind blowing but watching men riding horses against lovely backgrounds is sort of enjoyable.But going back to the narration, Ed Harris' voice lives in my brain right now. Even as I write this, I hear him. He was channeling some of the best of my history professors back at the University of Minnesota.Well done! I recommend this if you're a documentary fan and open to learning things about the United States at the end of the 1800s.",

Viewers have pointed out that the writing often lacks depth, presenting a one-dimensional view of Earp's life and the Wild West. The show's pacing can feel uneven, with significant events rushed or glossed over, leaving audiences confused. Additionally, some argue that it sensationalizes violence, prioritizing action over storytelling. The characterization of Wyatt Earp has been described as simplistic, failing to capture the complexities of his persona and the era he inhabited. Overall, these factors contribute to a perception of the series as a disappointing and shallow interpretation of a fascinating historical figure.Story telling level - like a 4yr child, this fake docudrama just so bad.",

        "body":"This series is wildly inaccurate. For instance, Ike Clanton was never the leader of the Cowboys. After his father died, Curley Bill ran the show, and Ike was simply a member of the gang. The whole series revolves around the animosity between Ike and the Earps, but Ike was a bit player in the real events.They also say that the Earps worked for Behan, which is totally untrue. The Earps were town marshals and Behan was the county sheriff. The Earps not only didn't work for Behan, there was open animosity between them because Behan was a puppet of the Cowboys.They largely present the Earps as white knights who just wanted law and order. The truth was that they were pretty shady too, and being town marshals provided them with some cover for their Illicit activities.The costumes are pathetic, and the sets look like they just picked any buildings on the lot that weren't being used at the time, regardlessif they were period appropriate or a building you would see in AZ at that time. For instance, in one scene, Josephine is seen walking up to a building on a blacktop sidewalk.The weapons are also not right. Earp didn't use a Buntline (there's no proof that they even really existed).There are many other things wrong with this, but they are too numerous to mention.I had high hopes for this, but they couldn't decide whether they wanted to make a documentary or a \"based on a true story\" show, and they didn't do their homework to make sure it was accurate.

        "body":"Greetings again from the darkness. Documentaries on bands, singers, and musicians have become very popular over the last few years, and although filmmaker Gotham Chopra has focused mostly on sports in his previous work, he dives right in with a four-part HULU series covering the forty years of stadium rockers Bon Jovi and their electric lead singer Jon Bon Jovi (nee John Bongiovi). This is not the first documentary on the band, so Chopra takes an unconventional approach. The series jumps around (and weaves back and forth) through the years, with the band's 40-year anniversary tour acting somewhat as a structuring device, along with Jon Bon Jovi's struggle with his voice.Contrasting with a traditional chronological trip through the band's history, this approach requires a bit more concentration from the viewer. It also makes all four episodes 'must watch' TV in order to get the full backstory along with Jon Bon Jovi's (JBJ) personal journey. It is recommended that those interested commit to all four episodes, as the clips, photos, and interviews are mostly previously unseen. To assist with the overview, this review will break down each of the episodes separately.Episode 1: New Jersey vs Everybody\nThe only way this could begin is by reintroducing the 1980's hair band with clips of their live shows and videos. We then jump to 2022 as JBJ explains the band has rented the now unused Meadowlands Arena for their rehearsals for a mini-tour (15 shows) to prepare for their 40th anniversary celebration. He also discusses his voice struggles and the surgery for his vocal cords. Chopra takes us back to JBJ's childhood and high school, and we learn about his first couple of bands, along with the crucial role played by (1978) The Stone Pony and Southside Johnny and, of course, Bruce Springsteen in Asbury Park. Four additional key elements discussed here are JBJ commenting on his commitment to the craft of songwriting, the start of a beautiful affiliation with sound engineer Obie O'Brien, the partnership with Richie Sambora - a perfect blend of voice and guitar expertise, and the opportune gap created by the breakup of mega-band Van Halen. We hear very little actual music.Episode 2: Nowhere to Everywhere\nThe first (of 15) shows occurs in Omaha, and we also get the first bit of the modern-day Richie Sambora interview. The band reminisces about the early days on the road, and the make-or-break nature of their third album. Of course, they need not have worried as \"Slippery When Wet\" sold millions and established the band as king of the rock anthem with huge singalong hits, \"You Give Love a Bad Name\" and \"Livin' on a Prayer\". The band also hit at the peak of MTV, and the combination of hair, catchy tunes, and JBJ's blinding smile drove their album and ticket sales higher and higher. In this episode, we learn about the hiring of agent Doc McGhee, the formation of the Make a Difference Foundation, and playing Russia on the global tour. There are flash cuts between different versions of \"Livin' on a Prayer\", and it's the first we hear of issues with band cohesion.Episode 3: Brothers in Arms\nThis episode kicks off with the 15th and final stop of the tour in Nashville. As he comes off stage, his wife tells him, \"It wasn't great\". Being a perfectionist, JBJ takes it to heart and at that point decides he must move forward with the vocal cord surgery. It's a huge risk that could end his career ... or possibly allow it to move forward. We get the flashback to JBJ and Dorothea eloping to Vegas, as well as various versions of the band breaking up. The family nature of the band is mentioned frequently, and it conflicts with the \"I'll show you\" battle of 1990 solo albums by JBJ and Richie Sambora. There is some mention of JBJ's acting career and desire to write soundtracks, but he never loses sight of what is clear to us: he was born to be a band leader. Much more than a pretty face and booming voice, JBJ had visions for the band and was always strategizing about the next few steps. We can't help but chuckle as he recalls the hoopla over his haircut, and his reflections on what Elvis went through. A standout point in this segment is the huge international following the band developed as 'grunge' took over the rock scene in the U. S. Sadly, the effects of drugs on the band are detailed here as well ... including Richie heading to rehab.Episode 4: Legendary\nA fitting final episode takes the split with Richie Sambora head on. His replacement, Phil X, receives plenty of kudos for his stepping in on short notice as the band went on tour. The stress on JBJ, and his desire to carry even more of the burden, is evident. To his credit (albeit only partial credit), Richie's interview includes an apology to the fans and \"the guys\". A reunion occurs at the 2018 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, but it ends there. It's also in this episode where JBJ discusses his fundraising for Al Gore's Presidential campaign, which served as his initial foray into politics - leading to more political activism and a heightened social consciousness.The band's albums and hits and tours are mentioned throughout the four episodes, but fans should know that this is an informative documentary, not a musical one. Most of the insight here comes from Jon Bon Jovi himself, as well as bits and pieces from the Richie Sambora interview. Band members David Bryan (keyboard), Tico Turner (drums), Hugh McDonald (bass), John Shanks and Phil X (guitarists), and Everett Bradley (percussion and vocals) are given time to comment, as is Bruce Springsteen. Mostly what we are left with is the high regard they each had for JBJ as a leader. The bouncing around of years and eras may be a bit challenging for some viewers, yet Bon Jovi's music is universal and it becomes quite clear that Jon Bon Jovi cares very much for his legacy ... a legacy entrenched through his 40 years of art.The 4-episode docuseries premieres all episodes April 26, 2024 on Hulu.",

        "body":"Still going after 40 years, Bon Jovi are one of the most enduring bands in rock 'n' roll history.\"Thank You, Goodnight\" not only celebrates the band's legacy, but the fight to keep performing. While there's only four episodes, they run between 60-90 minutes each, so there's plenty to enjoy.Even the most hardcore Bon Jovi fans will find something new in the archival footage and old band interviews. There's even an unreleased song 'Cadilliac Man', which was intended for the '90s Robin Williams movie of the same name.The structure of the documentary switches between the band's preparation for their 40th anniversary tour and looking back at their career - going right back to Jon Bongiovi's early years in the '70s. Even Jon's acting career is briefly covered, as well as the impact of 9\/11 and Covid.While this is a celebration, the documentary doesn't skip over the darker moments: the focus is on Jon's battles with a failing voice. Jon does everything in his power to stay at his peak, and even contemplates retiring if he can't perform to his satisfaction. At one point, Jon gets emotional when talking about the band's legacy. That's how much it means to him.Though Jon is - expectedly - front and centre in this documentary, there's also contemporary interviews from the surviving members of the band and some of their managers. Richie Sambora explains the real reasons why he left the band in 2013 (a combination of addiction problems and family issues). Bruce Springsteen - who Jon became good friends with - is also interviewed, as well as Jon's wife Dorothea.While most of the albums are covered, I was disappointed that the excellent 'These Days' album was skipped over. It was a big departure from the band's usually optimistic, working-class anthems; it would have been interesting to hear the band discuss why they chose that bleaker path, but sadly it's not to be. And Jon's second solo album 'Destination Anywhere' (recorded in the break between 'These Days' and 'Crush') is barely mentioned: though considering it was a middle-of-the-road album, it was probably a wise choice.But the documentary ends on a positive note, with the band recording their new song 'Legendary' from their upcoming album.",

One big problem for me was the lack of time they spent talking about some albums. They spent a good bit of time on Slippery when wet and New Jersey which was good, but they didn't spend much time on Keep the Faith to Bounce. These Days in my opinion was their last great album. Crush although far from their best music, was their big comeback in 2000. I was 17, just finishing school, a great summer , it holds a lot of nostalgic value for me. Bounce is my favourite post 2000 album. They just skimmed through all these , and they spent alot more time on their 2020 album and the new album thats coming, that I couldn't care less about. I was disappointed there.Overall its quite good and a must see for Bon Jovi fans, but I did come away feeling it could have been a better. The band do hold back on some things that happened over the years which is understandable. I've read a lot of people saying Jon has a big ego all the way through this. I didn't think so. What the man has achieved in his life is monumental ,only what the rest of us could dream about, and he was just being honest.It's not perfect, but I do recommend.",

The sound bites for each member was flat and didn't even reveal their individual uniqueness.Look at what these guys did with their careers and how much they accomplished. So much is missing with this show. Who edited this? The narrative jumped around too much between episodes. I could not find much continuity or story to grasp on to. It's definitely not a series to binge watch.You could pick up a rock magazine from the 80's and 90's and be more entertained with the actual two page article rather than this boring series.",

JBJ confuses narcissism for self-awareness through 4 cringy hour-long episodes.Desperate to show what an important musical talent he is and how the loss of his precious voice. (which isn't that big a loss for someone who always sings through his nose) is a big deal.Ritchie Sambora's current day appearances are equally cringe-worthy as he's clearly wasted slurring his words.A telling sign of JBJ's barely there grasp of reality is when he declares Tico Torres as one the best drummer he's ever heard. I've personally watched Tico fall off the drum throne trying to keep the simplest groove.All in all an interesting trainwreck to watch.",

But they were a bit too \"pop\" for my musical tastes.Speaking of which, I did chuckle when, early in the series, the band are described as \"Heavy Metal\".This series is not really a story of the Band \"Bon Jovi\", but more the story of Jon Bon Jovi (John Bongiovi Jr). So series title is a bit misleading. Of course the band is a focus in the story, but really it is all about Jon Bon Jovi's story and his struggles as he got older.Anyway, loved the first episode. Showed his and the bands origins etc.. Thought that was all interesting. 9 out of 10 for that episode.But the rest of the episodes were just too long and I became bored. Yes there was some interesting things in there, but there was too much unnecessary content.

        "body":"Very good. In fact, really good. Probably the best thing to come out of Disney Animation since Encanto or Once Upon A Studio, and especially since most of their recent projects, with these exceptions, have been sub-par to say the least. So, it was quite a surprise to me when I found out the studio were doing this little show. However, it kinda went under my radar for about a month, which isn't a shock considering they put in little to no marketing for this thing. I did see a trailer for it which got me a little interested but not enough to fully convince me to watch it in a hurry. But when I eventually went to watch it, I was genuinely shocked by just how good it was. There's a great amount of world building and cultural representation which I appreciate the team for doing since it was a show about Nigeria. I was also shocked by the amount of serious subject matter discussed in this show. About poverty, the upper class vs the lower, and the conflict between their economic values and moral judgment. The studio had covered racial issues before in Zootopia but nothing on what the levels of thus series has. No spoilers but there's plot detail and twist halfway through with Tole's best friend, Kole and his mom involving the lead villain that I think goes in a particularly dark place that I wasn't expecting. Not to mention, it can get really sad abd emotional with the character's and their relationships in a way thats dramatic but also feels so real and impactful. On top of that the animation I'd still relatively good. It's cheaper by the standard of their movies, but it has that Disney Animation touch with the character animation and the assets that feeks more high quality than most straight to streaming shows. (*cough Megamind vs The Doom Syndicate) If I had any complaints about this series, it'd be the ending act. While I won't say it's bad, but I feel it was a little undercooked, especially with the villain who gets defeated way too easy in my opinion. Plus, the lizard wasn't used nearly to the potential I thought they were building up to in the trailer. They did show it's powers sort of, but not enough. Really it was just false advertising IMO. However, it was still a great series that was a pleasant surprise. It's severely underrated and hope more people give it some attention. Kudos to the people who made this show and how much heart and effort they really put into making it. Hope they make more original short form mini-series like this one.",

The show focuses mainly on class differences between the islanders and the mainlanders. Over the years, Disney has always been able to do a nice job of highlighting cultures from around the world (Coco, Moana, Mulan, Aladdin, etc.). In Iwaju, they celebrate the Nigerian culture, not only on screen, but also by featuring a mostly Nigerian cast and crew.If you do plan to watch this show, just remember that it is a children's show meant for children. If you are expecting the next great animated series, you will be disappointed. Although I enjoyed the story and feel that this is a good show all around, there were moments where I did lose interest for a little bit. Overall, I would rate this show a 6\/10.If you are looking for an easy quick watch (6 episodes 25 mins each) that the whole family can enjoy, I recommend checking this one out on Disney+.Thank you!",

After seeing Wish, I was so disappointed in Disney and thought they were off track, then I saw this and clearly Disney still has some great things to share with us. Hope this series gets cleared for future seasons. Don't sleep on this one it's definitely cinematic. Kind of gives a Black Panther vibe as to how tech is implemented but it focuses a bit more on being a family friendly show. Even with that focus it is relentless in bringing interesting scenes and content. Please, Disney, don't shut down this project, there is gold, here.",

This one gave insight into the lives of five top NBA players, including Lebron James, Jayson Tatum, Jimmy Butler, Domantas Sabonis, and Anthony Edwards. Liked how they all presented themselves for the most part except for Anthony Edwards who seems somewhat of a egotistical, immature, idiot punk. He attends the birth of his first child and as soon as she's born, he leaves the hospital room and his wife to check the last minutes of his team's game on his phone. He doesn't participate in the first part of Thanksgiving that he and his wife are hosting because he's too busy playing his stupid video games. Grow up, man!",

Each player is shown in different depths and angles, there's not enough focus on any of them during the episode, there's no sense of how the season is going and we don't follow their stories throughout multiple games.

We understand that it's just a marketing product for the NBA and Anthony Edwards' shoes, but still, it could have been much better than this piece of puff, especially given that they had access to the players.

Why is it so hard to have a name rather than some broadly asked 'oh I have a woman standing behind you' or 'you lost someone who was a man that's telling me...' how do you not have names?

You're actually willing to suspend disbelief because when these frauds go fishing, they occasionally get a bite but for some reason never seem to completely connect on all fronts?

If you rewind and playback, analyze well the reading you will see you or someone you know fits well into his readings. I want to believe him. The guests are encouraging him with their over exaggerated facial expressions guiding the reading. Perhaps do the reading with a panel separating him and the guests. That's also another thing. You have multiple guests, how easy is that. If one thing doesn't relate to a person then pop over to the next person or the next and it's likely a message will relate to someone on the couch.",

There are over a million dollars worth of prizes if he can prove his abilities, but no psychic or mediums ever try to cash in. They usually have excuses like \"they don't want to profit off their gift,\" but have no problem sucking up old people's pension checks, while never offering answers of value (ie. Where's the will stored or what is the combination to the safe).Disgusting that Netflix showcases these horrible people. Editing, camera angles, hot and cold readings give them the appearance of credibility , while making money off suffering.",

The second show with Billy Porter I don't think it went as well as they expected and I didn't like the fact that one of the guests that Billy Porter brought didn't even get to have a reading because it was more focused on Billy porter. So now I watched the third episode with Nikki Glaser and the whole show was basically revolved around Nikki Glaser and her mom and dad. The two friends that she brought were not even really part of it. The one friend at the end of the very show Tyler says I'm going to do a private reading with you because I didn't get to you. Well yeah because she let Nikki Glaser take over the whole show. I don't like this I don't like the new approach he's taking and this is a waste of time.",

        "rating":1,
        "author":"zolariane",
        "date":"2024-10-13",
        "body":"I went into *Tyler from the Other Side* on Netflix with an open mind, expecting an intriguing look into the world of psychics and spiritual connections. However, after barely managing to make it through 18 minutes of the first episode, my hopes were dashed. The show, unfortunately, comes across as a missed opportunity that fails to deliver the authenticity and insight that one might expect from such a premise.The premise of *Tyler from the Other Side* revolves around Tyler, a young psychic who claims to connect people with their deceased loved ones. This concept, while promising on the surface, quickly falls apart as the episode progress - or in my case, as the first episode dragged on. Rather than offering an insightful, emotionally charged experience, the show seemed to rely on generalized, vague statements that could apply to almost anyone.One of the most disappointing aspects of the show is how much of Tyler's \"readings\" feel like a case of *fishing for whatever fits.* There's a common criticism of psychics known as \"cold reading,\" a technique where the psychic offers very broad or ambiguous statements, hoping that the person being read will latch onto something that resonates. Unfortunately, this was glaringly evident throughout the brief time I managed to watch. Tyler throws out statements like, \"I'm getting a sense of someone with the letter J or M,\" or \"I feel like there's a connection to water,\" and waits for the person to react. These are the kind of statements that could apply to almost anyone, making it feel more like a guessing game than a spiritual revelation.As I watched, I couldn't help but feel bad for Tyler. Whether he truly believes in his abilities or not, the way the show presents him makes it difficult to see him as anything other than a fraud. It's a harsh judgment to make, but the lack of specificity in his readings and the constant fishing for reactions give off the impression that the show is more about creating drama than offering genuine spiritual connections. There's also the unfortunate element of Tyler being a young man who seems genuinely invested in helping people, which only adds to the sense of discomfort as he struggles to maintain credibility in a format that does him no favors.Netflix, usually a platform known for producing high-quality content, really missed the mark with this show. It's hard to understand how *Tyler from the Other Side* made it past the cutting room floor. The show doesn't offer the depth or emotional resonance that viewers expect from a series that deals with grief, loss, and supposed connections to the afterlife. Instead, it feels like a rushed, surface-level attempt to capitalize on the popularity of psychic mediums and reality TV.There's also the issue of ethics. Shows like *Tyler from the Other Side* walk a fine line between entertainment and exploitation. When dealing with something as sensitive as grief and loss, there's an inherent responsibility to handle the subject matter with care and authenticity. Unfortunately, *Tyler from the Other Side* feels more exploitative than empathetic. It's hard not to feel for the people who appear on the show, clearly seeking closure or a connection with their lost loved ones, only to be met with generic readings that do little to offer true comfort.This being said, *Tyler from the Other Side* was a disappointment on multiple levels. It didn't offer the insight or emotional depth I had hoped for, and instead left me feeling uneasy about the authenticity of Tyler's abilities and the intentions of the show. It's rare that I stop watching a show so early on, but after 18 minutes, I couldn't bring myself to continue.For anyone considering watching *Tyler from the Other Side,* I'd suggest saving your time and skipping this one. There are far better shows out there that deal with the themes of grief, loss, and the afterlife in a way that is both respectful and engaging. Unfortunately, *Tyler from the Other Side* is not one of them, and it may go down as one of Netflix's more regrettable productions.",

The visuals are mesmerizing and are the ones that attract people to watch and I kinda like some of the romance scenes. But sometimes the long ahh eye contact scenes with dramatic ost doesn't click with me as it kinda feels like it's exaggerated and cringe, but for me it isn't a big problem. This drama is making me excited for the next episodes even though idk what kind of story awaits in the future.Tbh I have no problem with the FL swaying easily as in my opinion it is realistic, as I sway easily either, example when my bias is wrecked by another member of a certain group, or when i had a small crush on a certain someone then changes the next day(well no one knows about me having a very abnormal and crazy mind), I think it's okay as long as we're not overly confident about it. I just hope that the FL doesn't do any more embarrassing thing because of her being swayed easily, because sometimes I kinda see it coming😨 but for know it's not that deep.I'm a fan of cliche stories as I just watched kdramas and I think this show is suitable for the ones who enjoys this kind of story. Okay sorry for my grammar and honest review, pls don't take is seriously. This is probably 8\/10 for me and the eye contact scenes took -2 points from it (is it too much?😭) soooo thanks for reading.",

What we get is a number of false starts that lead nowhere. It feels like too many writers were pulling this mess in different directions.Hey, everybody--your homework is to read the green DEMON'S MANUAL. The rules keep changing, but it's got to be in there. Here's the question: Can demons be shot and killed--or not?The attraction between the two leads is all about physical appearance. These generic lovers do generic things: he brings her flowers, they watch a horror movie, they ride a bike, she cooks, etc. Etc. I couldn't find any convincing individuality-or chemistry. In fact, it sure looked like Song Kang used his hand to block their first kiss.And Do-Hee isn't the brightest cookie in the jar. It takes until Episode 14 for her to show the slightest curiosity about her husband's day job. She's horrified, of course, but she sure gets over it quickly. \"Oh, you take the souls of desperate people who are then tortured forever? And one of them's my dad? No problemo.\"And I'm sorry--because I really like him-Song Kang is totally miscast as a demon. For most of the series he's sweet and loving or having a fashion moment. He's just not the baddy the audience deserves. I blame the writers because Song Kang can ACT when he's got a good script (see Navillera).The secondary characters engage in a lot of silliness that never adds up to a single genuinely funny moment. As for God, s\/he just bloviates about all the things she can't do. No help there, though I have a feeling she'll come through in the end.Later: I finished the series, and while a lot of the silly stuff was wrapped up, I can't see that anything important was resolved. A minor character is going to be damned for all eternity--someone who absolutely didn't deserve it. But no one in this series has a moral compass, so no one cares--as long as the big romance is saved. A lot of filler in the last two episodes. I was so ready for this one to end.",

Picture this: a contract marriage with an immortal demon, a sizzling tango in the streets, and our leads beating up goons with their combined special powers. Intrigued? You should be. This series is as fun as K-dramas get, offering a thrilling ride filled with chemistry, amusing banter, and well-timed humor.Meet Do Do Hee, the CEO of Mirae F&B, a subsidiary of the formidable Mirae Group led by her strong adoptive mother, Ju Cheon Sook. When a disastrous matchmaking attempt leads her to a blind date with the 200-year-old Demon Jeong Gu Won, little does she know that her life is about to take a wild turn. A series of events binds them together, with Gu Won's tattoo - the source of his power - transferred to Do Hee.As Do Hee and Gu Won navigate their newfound connection, tragedy strikes with the sudden death of Cheon Sook, leaving Do Hee to inherit the Mirae Empire under one condition: she must marry within a year. Thus begins a violent power struggle between Do Hee and her adopted siblings, who stop at nothing to prevent Mirae from slipping into her hands.Determined to uncover the truth behind Cheon Sook's death and tired of being underestimated her whole life, Do Hee proposes a marriage of convenience to Gu Won. She'll inherit Mirae and gain a powerful bodyguard, while he'll retain access to his supernatural abilities.But My Demon isn't your typical gloomy supernatural drama. Song Kang brings a refreshing twist to Gu Won, infusing the character with humor and mischief. Far from the brooding archetype, Gu Won is chaotic yet endearing, with a youthful energy that complements his demon status. Meanwhile, Kim Yoo Jung shines as Do Do Hee, exuding steely grace and intelligence as she navigates the complexities of her new role and relationship.The chemistry between Song Kang and Kim Yoo Jung is undeniable, igniting the screen with every interaction. Their dynamic portrayal of two seemingly different individuals who find common ground is electrifying and utterly captivating.Not to be overlooked is Kim Hae Sook's portrayal of Ju Cheon Sook, whose character transcends stereotypes with her shrewdness and empathy, adding depth to the narrative.While My Demon keeps viewers guessing with its intriguing plot twists and power struggles, it's not without its flaws. Secondary characters may feel one-dimensional at times, but they serve to enhance the central storyline.In essence, My Demon may not be a profound love story like Hotel Del Luna or Goblin, but it doesn't aim to be.

Also, it is true that the story may seem repetitive and not new, but the writer was creative in writing the dialogues between the characters. It is not like other dramas that have dialogues that have no meaning. Here I feel that every dialogue is important, and the directing and photography are indescribable, and the chemistry between Song Kang and Yoo Jung is very wonderful. I am excited for the new episodes and I am waiting for Friday and Saturday for them. The couple has a healthy relationship so far. I loved them together, I hope to see them in another project!",

The family drama is quite enjoyable as well, with many melodramatic moments. The crime case as well has some intense moments.The love story, on the other hand, is basic and predictable. And yet, it is a guilty pleasure, with enough romantic moments and cheesy scenes to keep things interesting.The performances, in addition, were all great by everyone in the cast.So, overall, seven out of ten.",

We still have 3 episodes to go and I don't know how I am going to make it.The intro song is super catchy and that's why I gave this a 4 instead of a 1\/10. I love the beginning of each episode and everytime it ends and I know I have an hour to go, I cry inside.This series does not know what it wants to be, a love story, a depressing tale about death and suicide, a fantasy, an action movie, a thriller, and everything in between. The series tries everything and does nothing right. There are so many plot holes and so many convenient\/unrealistic things that happen for the sake of moving on with the plot. It's dragged on, and on, and on, without anything interesting happening.I have no idea who the audience for this literal garbage is but if it works it works.",

The main characters are insanely good-looking. So okay, let's give it a try.Just like a dust sucked by a vacuum, I spent my days checking social media for fan edits and theories, my Tuesdays and Thursdays for BTS, and my Friday and Saturday late nights for the new episodes.The main lead's chemistry is over the roof. You can see that there's no awkwardness towards each other when they act, as if they're not acting anymore.The storyline is well-put. There's no wasted frame for misunderstandings. Even the execution of their past life was amazing. It was a well-executed 30 minute storytelling where everything was explained in a way that the viewer won't feel rushed.The supporting characters are all great. They really know their role and acted it well.The OSTs are very good. I added them all in my playlist.The ending scenes are very cinematic. It's the series where I didn't feel robbed by endings. Instead, I looked forward to it.MY DEMON is a well-executed and well-narrated love story that encompasses time, social status, and the supernatural.PS. Everyone should say sorry to Lee SangYi.

A wonderful Kim Yoo Jung, who, although young, has acting in her blood since she was a child actor, does everything she can in the conditions of a story full of holes and unsuccessful advertising. Even for the fantasy genre, the script and direction are too bad. Guiding the supporting actors to exaggerate is a big directing mistake, given that it's about people in costume, not peasants. The story is far too long, sickly obsessed with Christmas, Christmas on repeat, Christmas leftovers, torture and food. Average special effects, which would have been successful, if there were not so many statics and replays. Material of 8 episodes, extended to 16 episodes. Too bad for the actors, at least in the BHE filming, they had fun.",

The visuals are breathtaking in some scenes and though it's tropey, if you enjoy that kind of thing it's compelling and entertaining. The pacing in the first half moves quickly, with the characters are introduced well, a couple of different plotlines and personal stakes established, an engaging romance, and it felt well balanced and bingeable.Unfortunately the good parts started to slowly fall away in the second half of the drama, when the character development took a back seat to more murder mystery \/ crime solving exposition. It just felt like the focus shifted too much and it became a bit boring and hard to finish. It was still worth a watch even if it was underwhelming at the end, because I did enjoy myself for most of it.",

And, oh, there's The Glory this year, which was a hit but I haven't seen yet. It's not that it ain't good; it's just that I'm not into bullying-type drama or steamy scenes. Thankfully, I found My Demon on Netflix before the end of the year, and it got me hooked up and well-seated for the entire episode. It has all types of drama in one, which is very rare. It's amazing how every episode has something to it, like a mystery that I wanted to unlock. It's not your typical rom-com, nor would it just fall into the thriller or fantasy category, but it will serve you everything you look for in a drama. It's very interesting and entertaining. I laughed the whole time watching it; I was amazed by the beauty of the cinematography; I got mesmerized by the actors chemistry; I fell in love with their past; I got thrilled with some of the episodes and also made me cry a river. This will go down in history as one of my favorites. Just like how I can rewatch Full House, Moon Embracing the Sun, and Love in the Moonlight, this too would be on my list of timeless dramas.",

It was AMAZING. I was eagerly waiting for each episode every week. The main leads, song kang and kim yoo jung, have the BEST chemistry ever which can be clearly seen in the behind the scenes too. They are both exceptionally attractive and their photoshoot was eye candy. I can tell they both like each other as they are very flirty even when there's no camera. The overall cast was perfect and the plot twists had me at the edge of my seat the entire time. The themes were fantasy, romance, and murder mystery. The romance between the main actors are enemies to lovers, past life lovers, marriage contract, and forced proximity. Literally the BEST ROMANCE TROPES EVER.

You could've added more demons in the show if that's what the protagonist is. You could've given him rivals, Achilles heels, etc. Eye candy aside which is obviously the entire objective of the show, you need substance which this show lacks.

Either the story was divided with something I didn't care, the ending was sad\/lacking which spoiled the drama for me or some other factors that would make me not give it 10\/10. But my demon gave me all the fixes I wanted in a great story. Some people complained that some tropes that are in this show are overused or copied but I strongly disagree. In my over 150 dramas that I have seen there is ALWAYS something formulaic, it's the structure of kdramas. What sets one or other apart is how they handle it and some do it better than others. Imo my demon is like that to me. And to top it off it does it with oneof the greatest visuals I have ever seen that ALSO has one of the best chemistry. Every week we fell more in love with Gu Won and Do Hee then in the next one we got behind the scenes content from Song Kang and Kim Yoo Jung that made us fall even deeper in love. No wonder it was such a sucess on netflix and social media platforms like twitter and tik tok. Though I assume that what becomes always gets more good and bad attencion so some small group of loud people would always jump on a bandwagon to hate. Happens every time. But overall the sucess is so deserved and made me become a fan of Kim Yoo Jung (who I was already familiar with but still not a fan before) and Song Kang (which was an actor I avoided in romances because of his past characters being either done dirty like love alarm or problematically romanticized red flags like nevertheless). I hope those two will work together in the future because the chemistry was so good and effortless and hope Song Kang will go through enlistment smoothly and come back as great as he is to a sucessful career. Also great sucess in Yoo Jung's next endeavour. They both deserve it.",

A lot of common sense is missed. The male lead is cringeworthy and I do not feel their connection at all.The very, very slow motion moments where they're looking into each others eyes on repeat becomes painful to watch.Such a predictable, overused storyline, there was rarely any element of surprise. I did not find the acting that great either.I honestly would not waste your time, I really wish I didn't.",

At first, i didn't have any expectation for this drama as im watching it for Kim Yoo Jung (as her last drama was in 2021). However, im hooked since the 1st episode & im suprised with the visual and chemistry between the leads, the plot, the cinematography and even the OST (especially the INTRO) are all well fitted. The rom-com parts may have some cliches but the way it's portrayed\/expressed are quit refreshing. Aside from the rom-com parts, i also love the fantasy, mystery and thriller sides of the story, it still managed to give us some twist & some of it are brilliant writing. If you want more fun on how to enjoy the drama, feel free also to read the theories from the fans as some of it are truly amazing & give more understanding on the plot particularity behind the connection of tattoo shifting, past life of leads etc. BONUS-the ENDING of each episode are truly captivating and for me, each new episode always be the best episode :)",

And none of this would work without them because it sits right on the edge of schmaltz, and the two of them manage to keep it from suicide.The world portrayed has mix of Catholicism, magical powers, reincarnation, and plot twists. I was left feeling the role of Catholicism was being held back against a strong urge to make more of it. Thank goodness for some restraint.It was a fun departure to have \"God\" played by a bag lady, who carefully explains on several occasions that she can guide events and intervene sometimes, but there is a randomness in the evolution of fate, much of it due to the unpredictable behavior of humans, randomness that can surprise her and make her aware of her own limitations.There are many attempts to lighten things up with comedic interjections, mostly way overboard. But one can take them as short digressions from the story's main thrust, which is how the two lovers manage despite adversities and villains of many kinds. And these two actors manage to contain what easily could become a viewer's impatience with long drawn out staring into each others eyes and extended exuberant celebrations of each others company.Altogether a delightful concoction admirable for how well it travels a knife's edge of overdoing things time after time. The viewer enjoys and marvels over its balance.",

        "body":"High school drama that turns a bit darker and more complicated as the story progresses. People like to sum it up as the darker version of Disney's Zootopia, while that isn't far off, I really think that Beastars is shaping up to be something much more.The main controversy surrounding this anime is that all the characters are, like in Zootopia, anthropomorphic animals. This turns many people off, because of a teeny tiny percentage of population. Let's adress the elephant in the room: Furries. Yes, that is the solemn, rather ignorant reason why many people just straight up refuse to watch it, as soon as they hear about it.I was going to give this show a hard pass, since I used to be one of those people. Man, I sure am, glad as hell, that I did not skip this amazing show. Problem is, people just like to play it safe these days and do not like to step out of their comfort zones. If you, as an individual are reading this, please remember, always try to keep an open mind, you might discover something you like but never even remotely considered before.Let's start talking about the actuall show, shall we?\nBeastars is set in a world populated by anthropomorphic animals that are divided into two main groups: carnivores and herbivores. Groups are like Yin and Yang. We've got carnivores that are constantly beeing feared and hated by the other group for their aggresive nature. Herbivores, on the other hand, like to play the role of victims, which sometimes gets out of hand and ultimatelly results in violent consequences.Very minor spoilers ahead.\nThere are three main characters in this story.\nLegoshi is a big, gray wolf, the so called 'top of the food chain'. Despite his menacing appereance he is rather shy and has very gentle and kind hearth. He often finds himself in trouble because he always tries to protect the ones that are close to him.Haru is a white dwarf rabbit, let's just say she is the exact opposite of Legoshi, she is small, weak and usually viewed as a kind of a baby animal by others.Louis is a red deer and, he seems like a spoiled, arrogant, cliché high school kid whom everybody loves, he is also a top actor. He can be described as the celebrity of the school. Looks can be deceiving...End of minor spoilers.\nStory of Beastars is masterfully written and can get really complicated. I was moved to tears in the first 8 minutes of the story, at the time when it was impossible to be attached to the characters. This alone shows how good the writing is. Story also covers many problems of society we live in (drugs, addiction, racism, segregation, etc.) The anime is based on a manga created by Paru Itagaki. Just few episodes into the anime, I could not get enough of the story and decided to read the manga. 150 chapters later, and I really love the story. If you stick to it in the first few minutes, you will find yourself craving for more.There is a controversy concerning that studio Orange chose to use CGI animation instead of drawing, and you know what; this is the best CGI animation I have seen in a TV series yet! Sure, it has its moments but those moments are so rare, you will hardly notice them. Some scenes are motion captured which means that the characters move insanelly realisticly.Voice acting and soundtracks are on another level, every sad scene makes your eyes water, every cheerful and happy scene makes you feel great for the characters. Overall, sound really does elevate the atmosphere that they are going for.Remember, always try to keep an open mind and do yourself a favour by watching this Japanese masterpiece of a show.(Cannot wait for 2nd season ;)",

        "body":"Being an anime that involves exclusively anthropomorphic animal characters, Beastars will push some viewers away for the simple fact that its characters associated with furries. However the actual story of a teenage wolf falling in love with a white rabbit in a society that demonizes predators set against the backdrop of a gruesome murder had me engaged from the first episode.Beastars aggressive narrative of romance, social divides, high school drama, and crime never once felt boring and smartly focused on its central characters while fleshing out the world they live in.Legosi was an excellent protagonist through and through. His struggle to deal with his primal instincts and act rather timid despite being a grey wolf was the strongest aspect of the story. The rest of the characters, particularly Haru and Louis, were very well written and always took the more challenging route rather than succumb to narrative cliches.The only complaint I can narrow down on Beastars, aside from how Netflix is releasing it, is with some inconsistent 3D-animation. It does not happen often, but some shots and whole scenes had a few awkward character movements that were to wooden or robotic to ignore. The rest of the anime animation is excellent, especially facial expressions on the characters.I cannot recommend Beastars enough to both casual viewers and hardcore fans of anime alike, now we just need season 2 to have an official release date and the first season on US Netflix.",

It's Zootopia, but add anime, better writing, violence, sex and blood. I thought the characters were really well developed over time and Season leaves more room for them to blossom more. I watched the whole first season in a night and loved it. I 100% recommend it.",

        "body":"This is my opinion. If you agree, that's fine. If you don't, that's still fine too. We all have different opinions.I first heard of Beastars because of its opening theme. It was a jam to listen to and its visuals were interesting for an anime series. However, I got sidetracked by other movies and shows that I had no time to watch it. Thankfully, after many days have passed, I had four hours to spare and that was where it hit me; this is the perfect opportunity.Like I said previously, the opening theme was a jam as I sway my hands like I was playing the drums. The opening isn't just where it stops getting good, because as the episodes went on, it just got better and better.The plot had me interested and from the first episode alone, I realized that this show demanded my full attention. It tackles mature themes that I would expect coming from a Seinen manga, and this is made even better with the interesting use of its characters. Even if they were animals, it got me invested because of the worldbuilding, the depiction of carnivores and herbivores, and the conflicts that the world revolves around in. Also, I find it very interesting that I can empathize with a fictional, anthropomorphic, gray wolf who has anxiety issues. From the first season alone, I can already say that these are well-written characters, especially Legoshi, Haru, and Louie.The animation was different than what I expected, but in a good way. I would have been fine with the stop-motion animation like in the opening, but the use of 3D animation and CGI were pretty good. A picture is worth a thousand words, and this saying holds true when you pause for a moment and think to yourself: this looks great.In short, this anime and everything that makes it an anime is great. This is truly worth watching. I might probably read the manga as it got me very curious about what happens next. Hoping the Season 2 continuation will be just as good as its first season.9.6\/10",

        "body":"This show is amazing, because it at the same time depicts a culture wherein animals work, live and learn together in a way that hasn't been done before. (Zootopia got pretty close), it tackles a lot of daily issues you could imagine, and a lot of that happens in the background, while you're focusing on more important things.There is life in this show, and it's gorgeous to watch in my opinion, because it creates this unique vibe where all these animals have human traits, but they all definitely have an underlying amount of animal instincts.Instincts we don't have or don't have anymore... And it plays with those in a brilliant way to create a segregated by nature world that is trying to find common ground between those that eat and those that get eaten. To find a way to function, to get away from those primal instincts.In this beautifully realized setting that's just brimming with style, a complicated love story, surrounded by a whole cast of unique, interesting and often likeable characters work their magic.And the great thing, characters grow in this show, some faster than others, some move around a whole spectrum while all of the characters in this show seem to be struggling in some way with something. No one is perfect even if some want to be, or act like they are.And that's so much fun.I cannot recommend this Anime enough.",

        "body":"To summarize the plot: a wolf is attracted to a rabbit because of her 'irresistible scent' - he doesn't know whether he wants to eat her or make love to her. He doesn't even know her personality properly -what he does know is that she is 'perfect for him' and he wants to commit his life to her. The rabbit is an outsider and she is continuously placed in damsel-in-distress situations where he has to save her, while also not trusting himself to be with her because he might hurt her.The story sounds familiar? Of course it is, because that is the same plot as Twilight. It is a fanfiction of forbidden love, with carnivore and herbivore animals instead of humans and vampires. No wonder teenagers love this show.The first episode captures your attention because there is a murderous carnivore on the loose, but that plot completely gets pushed to the side in favour of a lemonade story where Legoshi the wolf stalks and pines after Haru the rabbit. He has obsessive internal monologues a la Joe Goldberg from the tv series \"You\", but that's not seen as creepy at all.The characters deliver a lot of quasi-philosophic lines that do not make much sense, like \"No matter what I do, figuring out a woman's mind never gets any easier\" and have dramatic outbursts very frequently.Characters make plenty of unnecessary sacrifices, when they could have just called the police or avoided saying something. It also makes no sense why carnivores and herbivores are forcing themselves to live together in a society where they don't trust each other and carnivores have walk on eggshells so as to fit in with herbivores' standards, when they can just take over and keep the herbivores as their meat stock. The creator obviously did not think this through, and it shows that this universe has been poorly planned.On the other hand, this show does keep your attention, so you do want to know what happens next. In my opinion, Season 2 is considerably more interesting than Season 1, which wasted a lot of time on Legoshi's pining and white knighting of a rabbit he barely knows. I actually like a good interspecies romance, but this is poorly handled, perhaps season 3 will be better.I want to give this a 6.5, but since there is no option of this here, I will have to settle for a 6, as a 7 would be a bit too generous.",

It's so over thought and these characters are so human, but with animal traits, as if the animators hint at Hentai or humans acting like beast in the sexual arena. Not necessary.\nIt had a murder mystery, some rough background stories that are good enough for a school setting and excellent animation...but then they tried to mainstream a very subversive animal anime hentai culture. Come on Netflix, do your homework. And for the original Asian studio: get away from your personal infatuation with social Taboos and put more time in story and movement of the plot. Audiences are smart, it only takes a few subtles nuances to make us realize; he's shy, she's promiscuous, he's afraid of his own strength, she's afraid of not being truly seen, or whatever.

I connected with the main characters so much so that I find myself for the first time ever waiting eagerly for yet another season! Its just, despite having anthropomorphic characters, feels so real. The characters and their thoughts and emotions, just really connected with me in a way I never thought possible from a show. The idea of being a better person and moving through life despite what primal urges may hold you back, is so inspiring, I dare say it has impacted my life for the better. When the last episode unfolded, and inevitably ended, and the credits rolled, I felt this wierd, incompleteness, I guess that's what happens with a good cliffhanger, huh. I guess I have never seen a show that has such good character development, a true past. Before I spoil anything, I just wanted to say that this is such an amazing show.

There are plenty of good about this show, but also stuff that is offputting for many probably (me included).\n3D animation in anime looks quite good by now, but I'm not sold on it entirely. I appreciate the art and the intro is fantastic with the stop motion animation. I think visually this series has a distinct personality and I like it.\nThe story is ok, the world and its implications are interesting. It's almost like Zootopia, but here the carnivores haven't prevailed over their killer instincts entirely. You can't really avoid the comparison, because there are too many similarities. For me Beastars feels a bit like a sexualized fanfiction of the before mentioned film, with a slightly different setup and with a wolf instead of a fox. It's a teenage romance drama mixed with other, darker themes and sex.\nThe story is okay, but some plotlines that would be interesting are not really followed upon (maybe later?). Like the murder at the very beginning of the first episode. There are so many tensions setup in this society, that are mentioned and would need a more thorough explanation, but what we get is the convoluted love drama between a wolf and a dwarf rabbit. What's the point to a shared civilization between carnivores and herbivores? Why is it needed, that they cooperate instead of having herbivores as slaves or an underclass, that is kept for their meat? I think these are valid questions, because I don't really see the explanation for the value of this shared society. In Zootopia it's more acceptable, but I prefer anthropomorphic animals as metaphors for human psyche, than literal animals with human traits. I think the latter have more pitfalls, because I would need a better explanation of the reasons, why they break the behavioral patterns of their species. From this viewpoint the characters are well written individually, but I still don't see this on a societal level. What's the need for this kind of balance, between prey and predator? I just don't see it.\nThe sex stuff is also offputting for the same reasons mentioned above. These animals not really metaphors, but themselves with some human traits. It's a straight way to uncanny valley. Maybe this expression isn't used correctly here, but that's how I could describe the feeling this evokes, the best. The line between human and animal becomes very blurry, while you know they are literal animals. I've seen enough furry sex fantasy garbage on deviantart, to feel uncomfortable about it (one of the reasons I left the site). The reason this stuff works in Bojack Horseman for example, because it doesn't try to explain stuff and doesn't throw nature facts at you about species, like it happens often in Beastars. It's goofy enough, that you just accept what happens, because interspecies relations mostly played for laughs. Here the bunny is meant to be seen as very sexual and I just don't see the point. Furry porn is a fetish, that I'm not really eager to understand. That said, if you are willing to overlook the stuff I wrote about here, you'll be in for an engaging, but a bit over the top teenage romance drama.",

Only writing this in hopes for a season 2.Great writing. The characters' personalities reflects the animals that they are.Only listened to the dubbed(english) version, but the voice acting is flawless and fits their characters.Cool artstyle combining 3D\/2D that works great together.",

As a member of the school's drama club, Legoshi works as a stagehand and supports the actors of the club headed by the star pupil Louis, a red deer.\"\"Out of nowhere, Tem, the alpaca, is brutally murdered and devoured in the night, setting off a wave of unease and distrust between the herbivore and carnivore students. At the same time, Legoshi has a fateful encounter with Haru, a small dwarf rabbit who has been in love with the red deer Louis, and begins developing complex feelings for her.\" (Wikipedia)Based on that, leaving out the animal part, the anime seems like a slice of life drama based on a love triangle. But fortunately is a lot more than that.Beastars is a strange anime. It uses a lot of classic tropes, but in a way that they appear to be fresh and new. And that is definitively a sign of a good storytelling when you pick something old, give it a new cloth and it appears to be completely new.Beastars does that flawlessly and in a very interesting way.

I've never been very interested in any anime but I decided to give this one a go because the furry community would not shut up about it! It is one of those shows that is very deep, it can take time after you've watched it to realize things. When I first watched it, I thought it was good but my mind wasn't quite comprehending the complexity of it. After some deep thought though, I realized how in-depth it goes into life using anthro characters to communicate that. The more I think about it even now the better it gets. The soundtrack is astounding and puts me to tears, especially when I can recognize a song from an emotional moment. I care about the characters so much throughout the plot, and towards the end of season 1, where it begins to pick up, so many curve balls are thrown and it makes you feel for characters you even may not like. The soundtrack compliments that perfectly. I cannot wait for season 2 where it is supposed to be released in January of 2021. I also plan on reading the manga after the show is done. Don't want to spoil anything ;) 10\/10 would recommend.\nPS. People always call this show \"Zootopia For Adults\" but this show is really something else. It's definitely it's own thing.",

Even though the plot is same as every other isekai (it got a late adaptation, this series popularized all the tropes in the first place), what sets it apart are the characters and the worldbuilding. Rudeus is a great protagonist that doesn't just become another Isekai harem God just cause he got hit by a truck, he is a flawed human who gets a second chance at life and tries to better himself like every other character in the show. I'd go as far as to say that Mushoku Tensei is the most logical of all isekai. Aside from all of that this show also excelles in animation, even the opening theme is a banger. All of this makes it a beautiful experience everyone who loves Fantasy should give a try. (If you can stomach some fanservice her and there)",

        "body":"It's a pretty horny show. Excessively so. Even by anime standards for shows that are known to do this it pushes that boundary a little far. They try to dress it up with other elements so you can look past that. Such as the main character being overly emotional at times due to his relationships. But it's definitely a harem with fan service, full of unbelievably accommodating female characters.That said, this isekai sexual wonderland is perfect for the narrator given who he is. At this point it's unsure if this has something more to do with the overall evolving plot, or is just a convenient excuse to do the same show we've all seen before. The former would make this interesting. The latter, utterly unsurprising. Narration itself is delightful, and very fitting. The major characters we're introduced to are all likable people, if not a little on the typical side. Combat animation is done very well, and a few fights are thrilling with real stakes on the line. It's also easy to see the care they put into the sequence of events and pacing throughout. A clear indication they really do want to tell a story here.Over-sexualization and too much fan service often ruin shows like this from being what should be something pretty amazing reduced to just another series in a pile of forgettable entries. What exactly is the appeal of a panty shot in a dangerous, supposedly tension-filled moment? Or large breasts prominently being featured for no reason other than to be featured? Or the harem category in general, which would be engaging if it weren't for the utterly ridiculous way these women throw themselves at the main character. There was a part in the latest season that could have been so much better had they put in a little more effort. It had the potential to seriously engage the audience in sympathizing with Rudy's romantic dilemma. But no, completely unrealistic events are what we're given, and apparently there's a market for this s***.It could have been brilliant, but you can settle for entertaining. Just expect the usual nonsensical harem BS and the rest is okay.",

That's just normal. But its unbalanced in anime. The level that so often is encapsulated is not ok, even if they write decent characters too, more often then not it's mere fan service.And this is before we add children to the mix!Does it really have to be said?Some things shouldn't be defended and I agree you can take on controversial topics if you're careful ... very very careful ... but this clearly isn't one of them.

The result was that I enjoyed it reasonably well. It's set in a fantasy world, as expected, where a middle-aged shut-in named Rudeus starts a new life for himself. What sets it apart from typical overpowering stories is that the drawbacks of his previous shut-in life occasionally come into play, balancing out the successes and failures nicely. The animation was also consistent, making it enjoyable without stress. However, there are quite a few explicit scenes, especially in the beginning, so those who are uncomfortable with that should be cautious.",

        "body":"This anime is so close to being fantastic. Great animation, nice music, compelling story, an intriguing world, and several interesting characters. Unfortunately, the openly pedophilic characters, sexual assault, and rape played off for laughs makes this show disgusting. These themes appear in almost every single episode. I am honestly shocked at how many people are giving this show praise. There are plenty of ecchi anime I like, but this anime goes way further than any of them. This is not \"fan service\". I stopped watching multiple times due to how revolting some scenes are, only continuing because of how interesting the rest of this anime is and with the promise from other people that the \"fan service\" goes away after a certain, especially bad episode.After finishing the whole season, I am not going to continue. The people arguing that the \"fan service\" goes away and the main character becomes better are wrong. It does not end, and he does not become good. The story follows a 40+ year old man in the body of a young boy whose defining characteristic is that he grooms and sexually assaults children. This is a fantasy dream come true for men attracted to children. The final scene of the last episode has that 44 year old man spying on a 12 year old girl bathing, which includes a slow pan up the nude girl's body.Showing openly pedophilic characters, sexual assault, and rape in an anime is fine. Almost all of the pervy stuff this anime shows would be fine. If it didn't encourage it. The characters are rewarded for sexually assaulting people (typically children), the narrator and multiple adult characters make jokes about grooming and abusing children, and the anime presents it as something good\/funny.This is the worst of the kind of anime that makes people look down on those who watch it. What this anime does is not OK. Hopefully the positive ratings are coming from people who rated after only watching a few episodes. By episode 4, I would have given this anime an 8 out of 10 rating, but the themes discussed above get worse as the show goes on.",

I can't wait to see where this goes. The characters are flawed and you get to see them work through their issues as they progress to be better people. It is easily one of my favorites new shows.

        "body":"Almost as if some creators want to force their sexualizing agenda onto mother nature with their colonizing ideas of what is man and woman, something that has been consistently proven to be a result of sociology and not biology all along, because sex has always been a bimodal diversity with two high ends peaks embodied in diverse ways where men tend to share biological features matching the average woman and vice versa for women, which includes DNA itself, which is the reason why trans women have been regarded as biological women all this time. The idea of what is a man or woman was always a social decision, which biologists have been screaming about for decades to prevent the religious and often socio-political push towards a two dimensional view of life and sex, because it inevitably leads to sexism, racism, misogyny, authoritarianism, etc.What we are watching in shows like this is often a justification for social conditioning of the fragmented binary view of life that often results in psychological issues and even suicide, because it holds the consciousness of an infant in a non-relational state, which creates imbalance of masculine and feminine aspects within one mind and body. This is especially true for young boys as they have been encouraged to prevent regression to the formal state of unity by disconnecting from the mother, which furthermore manifests in the way men develop relationships with women as a result of repression of the feminine within themselves, and so they need to rely on gender roles as a form of control. We all know from statistics the traumatizing effects of gender roles on adolescent boys and girls, no need to go there, nature is too diverse for anyone to fit into social boxes. Nothing natural would need to be forced and groomed, but allowed to exist on its own terms and it is up to us to explore that difference in one another. This anime seems to hold onto the old paradigm that led to the disasterous effects in relationships in the first place, and make it seem like this is what men and women want, no not at all, I would bet the majority of men and women would not want to experience what these characters do in this anime.Let me make it clear that almost all of the pervy stuff this anime shows would be fine, if it didn't encourage it. The characters are rewarded for sexually assaulting people (typically children), the narrator and multiple adult characters make jokes about grooming and abusing children, and the anime presents it as something good\/funny.I want to stress out that although an adult protagonist in a child's body is no longer an adult within the created world of this anime, since he experiences life as a child again, however, it is the intentions of this anime that may be problematic.",

All of which except the MC which seemingly so would be an antagonist of any other series. This show could have been a lesson for NEETs, people with pedophilic notions, predatory behavioral patterns or some form of stunted mental disability making them child-like by educating them on the ethical ramifications of their behaviors and how harmful it is to their growth as well as those involved. Instead, the anime promotes all behaviors with no consequences for predatory behavior. It could have been great, it could have given the MC reasonable consequences for sleeping with a child or making the character feel a semblance of empathy or disgust through their actions, it did not. I really think this anime would have thrived more if it wasn't an Isekai. Every male character in this series is more redeemable than the MC. Even the reprehensible overweight kid on the throne threatening to assault Roxie has more leeway than a 40 year old in kids body feeling no guilt while taking advantage of a 15 year old. The MC is more childish than any character I've seen in anime and the worst part is that there has been little to no development, with the biggest development being learning to be a parent. Its ironic that kidnapping is frowned upon while predatory actions to young women are not. Root for the villains and supporting cast while they educate this miserable sack of crap that the writer somehow thought would be a good idea for either entertainment or some creepy manifestation of their own desires.",

It's a fantasy of the highest quality, a masterpiece, and genre defining for both fantasy and Isekais in the anime genre.The first review I wrote didn't seem to encompass my feelings towards this anime, so I just deleted it and started over again. I've never done this before for an anime, but it seems to be deserved here. I can honestly say it's in my top 5 anime's of all time along Cowboy Bebop, Violet Evergarden, Ergo Proxy, Fullmetal alchemist and Psycho pass, though which is the order I can't honestly say.But going back to the topic on hand - you might ask yourself why should you watch it? A lot of people complain about the MC because he is a grownup in a boys body (basically starting life from 0), but you can clearly see his flaws right from episode 1. This isn't a perfect MC, he's a perv, has low self-esteem, a loser, an underdog but his growth is fantastic. He becomes a decent human or at least tries to and the show is so complex that I honestly can't write it good enough here or explain it coherently. I'm bored of those perfect MCs and the generic good boy that becomes overpowered.This isn't your typical story, the world building is fantastic, the adventure is one of a kind and amazing, watching MT you feel like you grow up along Rudeus, the animation is one of the best I have ever seen, the style so unique, and the music (especially S2 opening) and OST is just perfection.Currently waiting for S2 part 2 and I'd watch 10 more seasons of MT, I just hope the quality stays as good for the whole animation, it's just incredible.",

Yes, ladies I know you don't want to be honest but this show is! And we men know and understand that you like it.This anime shows that we could potential be more honest with one another and by doing so prevent a lot of issues in relationships. Be smart about explaining, think how the other person would feel and take it slow. It all comes form biology and yes, men and woman are different and you know what that is ok.Facts that are illustrated in this anime show: You have to earn your value as a man. Woman are born with their value and they need to preserve it. Woman chose who has physical relations with them. Men chose who to give a relationship to. If a man becomes valuable to society and status, women will come to him. Woman would rater share a man with value then be with a nobody.I am excited for the nest season, this story is heart warming and honest! I watched S2 last part two times and it made me really happy.

His journey is not just about becoming overpowered like in most other titles, you really see his progress that lasts for years and even after that, he is not the strongest one at all. The characters that Rudeus meets at the same time are incredibly lively and interesting, so much so that you can make a separate film about any of them.When you just started watching Mushoku Tensei, you don't know anything about this world, and as the story progresses, along with the main character, you learn more and more about it. All the action takes place in different places, on different continents, and each of them is divided into different areas, where residents live with their radically different culture, abilities and behavior. Nature is changing, the monsters that inhabit these regions are changing, and a huge number of even the smallest things that can be talked about for a very long time.

I fell in love with this anime it shows us not to give up, not to make a bad connection to our loved ones, and how to make fast and efficient decisions. About Novel ( Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation has become a success, with its web novel published from Syosetu's rankings having made cumulative appearances as the most popular work on the website, and later expanded into a franchise began in 2014. By June 2023, the franchise had over 13 million copies in circulation. Although early volumes of the light novels were the subject of controversy due to sexual themes leading to censorship and complaints, the latter chapters of the series were the subject of praise for the development and handling of Rudeus' growth.)",

Despite the story having certain elements from Steins;Gate, the gang aspect made for intense and often unpredictable spin to the plot. The circumstances became more and more dire that made me rooting for the main character.The characters is by far the best aspect of this anime. The main character was your typical crybaby, but I didn't find a lot of problem with him, unlike many viewers who expected the kid to be some alpha chad. The other members of the gang all had interesting backstories and moral compasses that created clashing and intense interactions between these characters.As for problems, sometimes characters made questionable decisions that annoyed me. The animation of the fight scenes could be improved for better entertainment value, but I can't be too hard on this considering the stress the animators had during this time.Overall, a thrilling anime and definitely worth the hype. Can't wait for season 2. 8.5\/10.",

With the passage of events, the events began to disappear from the main character \"Takemichi\" more focus on her more, but we did not see that at the end of the anime almost.Using the flashback was great, but I felt in some episodes it was on time and even late.So as a summary of the review, Tokyo Revengers anime is worth your time because it is simply so much fun, great production and very good music, events that make you feel excited, thrilled and shocked in every episode, but because of the writing and some gaps at the end of the season events I think it deserves 8.5\/10.",

Takemichi is a 26 yr old who goes back in time and is living in his 13 yr old body with the knowledge he has as a 26 yr old. With that being said , there are numerous times where he acts as if he's even younger than 13 and much much dumber than a 26 yr old. He simply doesn't put 2 and 2 together when there is more than enough basic information available to him.Other than the MC being kind of a dunce - making stupid decisions and not realizing things when he should - there's a lot of good stuff in this anime. The other important characters are great, they're intriguing, well built, and they're badasses.The overall story\/plot line is also intriguing, but there are a few times where things just don't add up. I understand you must suspend reality when watching a show that involves time travel, but the main character just makes far too many dumb mistakes that go past the point of credibility.Other shows that have done similar sort of plots ; such as Erased - where the MC goes back in time to prevent a murder -do the same sort of thing but in a much better way. It's a solid anime and keeps you hooked , but if you're looking for a Time travel related anime definitely check out Steins Gate and Erased over this .",

        "body":"Honestly, I don't understand people giving this anime such a high rating. This is a clear example of a show that has great ideas behind it but awful execution.Yet again, as it is typical in so many bad anime, the protagonist is excruciatingly dumb and slow, to a ridiculous extent; he's no doubt the worst character. I gave the show a chance and watched the 24 episodes expecting him to wise up a little bit, but the guy is basically an annoying bag of potatoes ready to be beaten up and cry at every step while making terrible decisions. One would think that knowing how things unfold and having such terrible experiences in life he'd try to get a few steps ahead of everyone else, but instead he always finds himself in the middle of trouble without a plan.We are watching literal 14-16yo kids beating each other up almost to death, for no reason at all. They call themselves a gang of delinquents, yet they don't do any kind of illegal activities, other than riding motorcycles while being minors, and fighting. The show tries to appear mature, but it comes off as edgy and cringe, instead. Also, the fighting scenes are really bad.It's a shame, because the idea of a guy who can time-travel and has to involve himself in street gangs to save his girlfriend and friends is very promising, but it's full of inconsistencies and plot holes, things that are never addressed and are of vital importance to understand why things are happening in the first place.There's definitely worse shows out there, and this one is quite entertaining if you turn off your brain; don't expect anything smart to come out of any of the characters, specially the protagonist.6.5\/10.",

And he chooses to remain stupid af.I mean you are 26 years old and you have knowledge of future so do somethingat least once that looks like something an adult would do. But no this 26 year old guy gets outsmarted by virtually every kid he meets. He doesn't understand anything unless it is pointed out to him by everyone, although this dude is from future and knows what is to come. Everytime he started talking in his mind it goes on for like forever. In every episode there is a fight going on and he is standing still like a tree having his thoughts revealed to the audience which is incredibly stupid. In the meantime no one touches him while he is having his inner monologue.Pretty much in every turn of the street there is a fight to death is going on for no good reason. There are no adults in the city, no police, no neighbours, no parents, no brains etc. Every gang war is in a public location and no one bothers to inform the authorities. Someone gets stabbed but no police enquiries.The art style is super weird. The adults look like teens and teens look like they are in mid 30s.And my gosh!!! Nobita cries less than the MC.",

This anime is also not on trot with the other anime's of the decade and remains underrated. Some of the characters went through insane development like Chifuyu, Baji and Mitsuya.

This show surprised me in every aspect, I decided it was time for a new show to dive into so i just happened to stumble on TOKYO REVENGERS. I sat there still for 2 hours as i watched 6 episodes that at the time were the only TOKYO REVENGERS episodes available. As the credits on the the 6th episode began to play alongside its lovely outro song, i began to feel distress over not having another episode to binge. This is when i realized how good the show i just watched was, and how i felt the same feeling when i watched masterpieces like aot,hxh,and Neon genesis for the first time.I see comments comparing this show to Erased tryna brack these two shows into some sort of,\"time-travel back to childhood to solve the mysterious case of what's going on\" sub genre of anime. Listen i get how there is a concept comparison, but TOKYO REVENGERS has a unique and gripping style that takes away the morbid atmosphere that you could say Erased had. Erased is one of a kind, don't get me wrong, but so is TOKYO REVENGERS. This is a surprising, yet unfamiliar show that has already proven itself to be a top competitor for 2021s best new anime. I assure you if you give this show a go, you will not regret that you did!!!",

        "body":"The Tokyo Revengers poster would be the image that would represent the term \"Overhyped.\" A show full of obnoxious characters and a narrative riddled with enough holes in it to make a sponge appear like a flat surface. The plot centers on our main character going back in time to prevent his girlfriend from dying. If correctly explained and presented, this time-traveling romantic setting-which is a classic cliché-could make for a popular television program. Regretfully, it falls short in both areas. It gains some momentum early on but loses it really fast.The show's time travel element is the first source of confusion since it isn't adequately explained. The implications of the mc's actions during his time travel are grave for the very people he is attempting to save, but you hardly notice that gravity as he makes disgusting and absurd choices. Not much is spoken about time travel, and nothing is adequately explained. Additionally, the plot is safe; those who are supposed to die are killed off, and the main character is not forced to make a difficult decision. There is nothing that needs to be given up.TR is a fun television show that combines an odd cast of characters, a convoluted storyline, and needless action. Although the cliche-filled romance is enjoyable, the final arc is truly remarkable. Even with its flaws, including the obnoxious MC, the show is entertaining. With its complex, blatantly theatrical, and out-of-proportion characters, it may not be as focused on conflict resolution with sound decision-making, but it is still dumb fun. Overall, TR is a must-watch for fans of the genre.",

That was obviously not just because the Light Novel was high rated, but also because I was expecting a long term, mind blowing medical mystery.I have to say that this anime met all my expectations. But the weird thing is that I'm still very surprised by it. Because I ended up loving it for a different reason - the characters. More than a mystery, this is a very strong, character-based drama, that uses an episodic mystery setting to keep exploring its characters. You could say that it is a character analysis or a character-based mystery, where you're curious about the past of these characters, and the anime keeps revealing it bit by bit as it goes along. The story cherished its main characters and took their depth very seriously.In terms of characters and their depth and development, this was, in my opinion, the best anime that aired this season. Maomao is probably one of the best characters I've seen in any anime ever. She's smart, savage and you're always curious about what made her the way she is today.The music and the animation was surprisingly brilliant. The seamless production for this anime probably surprised everyone.I enjoyed the 1st part as it was a nice introduction to the characters, but I wasn't that impressed with the episodic mysteries. The 2nd part was when I really started loving the show. Because that's when the mysteries got considerably better, and they started to reveal a lot of surprising traits about our main characters and about their past. In fact I was shocked by what I saw during the final few episodes of the season. It made me look at the rest of the show a lot more differently.This anime is also directed brilliantly. There are some chilling sequences here. While a lot of it was because of the music, the direction matched that - especially how they were able to represent how Maomao could be beautiful and terrifying at the same time.Overall, this was a brilliant show and I'm very glad that we're getting a season 2 next year. I can't wait to learn more about the plot and these characters.",

I feel the humor, sadness, anger, and excitement of the characters. It presents serious themes with enough room for the audience to process them, and it pokes fun by humorously portraying characters as cats or mice to reflect their personalities.The show is set in an imperial Asian country and it injects all the taboos and social conventions from that time.

The background is absolutely well done. Yet the characters do not take away from that nor does the background outshine the character. The visual editors of this anime must be top notch!The ending was well done and now there is a season 2 in the making! I can not wait to see what happens!

The show comes replete with the usual anime trimmings, e.g. Ultra cute stereotypical female character designs, beautiful lead male character, exaggerated expression, comical visual transformation, and gratuitous well endowed female characters. Given its context, in which one main recurring location is a brothel, the latter are par for the course and not entirely gratuitous, by the way.For the more masculine viewers, the show contains romance though it's never the predominant focus. The evolving and developing relationship between the main characters is, however, part of the recurring theme throughout the show. It features often enough in each episode, but never too much to become cloy. If anything, the fraught relationship serves as a counterbalancing comic relief to sometimes pretty dark themes.Why is this a 10\/10 show? The 24-episode series features quirky yet realistically and well written main characters. The same level of love and care are given to most supporting characters, though obviously not to the same depth as the main ones. Background music and scores are memorable and work together effectively to accentuate and deliver the emotional impact of the story being told. The animation is top-notched and features very detailed and beautiful art designs. The animation features occasional virtual camera movement and composition reminiscent of live action shots, often giving the animation a pretty effective cinematic look instead of the usual 2D anime.The 24-episode format sounds somewhat long outside of famous recurring well established franchises. But pacing of the show feels just right. Viewers are given enough to understand what's going on with clues, bread crumbs, and foreshadowing to stimulate speculating brain cells. Viewers are always wondering what's going to happen next. A 24-minute episode simply flies by quickly, feeling as if the episode just started when it is in fact closer to the ending credit.Unlike many series where you'll get a few episodes where they feel like fillers. None exists in this series. This is not to say that flashbacks or recaps, reusing older footages, aren't present. They do, but they have been used effectively to highlight and tie together clues and bread crumbs sprinkled over previous episodes that are easy to miss or not easily recognized as inter-related. This is often done just when the arc is about to deliver the big payoff.When the big payoff does come, you definitely feel it. Some of the mystery and intrigue genre shows come off as unfair when clues have been purposefully withheld or actively misled to produce artificially the big surprise. The Apothecary Diaries does not do this and yet does not feel lacking in big surprises. Whenever the big reveals come, they are a satisfying balance between a surprise and an expectation fulfilled, rather than completely subverted. The best sort of surprises force the viewers to look back and say to themselves, \"yeah... I saw and thought about that, but couldn't quite commit to that conclusion.\" It's not only what is revealed as a surprise, but also how. The Apothecary Diaries delivers its surprises in ways that tugs hard at your heartstrings.The show was featured as recommended in my Netflix queue for the longest time. I wouldn't call myself a fan of the palace intrigue genre, anime or otherwise. These dramas are also a dime a dozen in live action Chinese and Korean series. I am very glad that I took the chance to check it out. It turns out to be one of those expectations subverted, in a very good way as a matter of fact.",

The characters are well developed and you see a progression in relationship but also the characters throughout the story. Each storyline leaves you wanting more. However what kept me hooked was the investigations, various facts presented that doesn't always have to do with the investigation (also not always presented in respect to the right time frame of the story...cough CPR being used). Also, the very humoristic and sarcastic deliveries makes it quite entertaining and makes it kinda feel a bit like Sherlock Holmes but with a small girl fascinated by poison in an Asian setting.",

        "body":"Satoru Mikami, a 37 year old office worker's, life is cut short when he is stabbed in the street... he is then reincarnated in a fantasy world. Here he is a slime, the lowest creature alive, however he has the ability to learn the skill of any creature he devours. He befriends the powerful dragon Veldora, who has been magically sealed away and gives him the name Rimuru Tempest. When Rimuru leaves the cave he meets various beings who he gradually befriends. As the series progresses his status quickly rises, as does that of the creatures he befriends.There are numerous anime series that feature ordinary people who for one reason or another find themselves in fantasy worlds; most are fairly interchangeable but a few have that something different that makes them stand out... this is one of the latter. The story starts well and Rimuru is a fine central character; he may be very powerful, after gaining many new skills, but he is keen to make friends and forge alliances rather than the usual more confrontational stories. That doesn't mean there is no excitement though; many enemies need to see just how strong he is before they become friends. The series also provides some good laughs and has a general feel-good quality. The animation is impressive as are the character designs. Overall a really fun anime that I'd definitely recommend to fans of the genre; I'm looking forward to season two which is due to air in 2020.",

        "body":"The headline puts it lightly, this series takes the \"Friendly Monster\" notion to a whole new level, \"several monster races working together for a better future\". That aside our Protagonist Satoru Mikami\/Rimuru Tempest is a loveable, yet believable character, who is a logical thinker (though that trait is lost when he's around Elves) & quite merciful to those who choose peace over destruction, but he's no pushover. The other races in the series each have their own unique quirks, capabilities & powers (even standard humans) & can easily back Rimuru should the need arise. (Although one 'particular' support character can be a bit endearing when viewers first see him). The series is nicely paced for its 23 episodes (with three bonus filler episodes for total of 26). (Bonus point from me for being one of the few anime to have Lizardmen as allies instead of enemies). Its well worth the watch & I look forward to more of the series from \"8-Bit Studios\" should they choose to continue the series.",

It is rare to even find an anime that made me want go out of my way to read the manga. Also finding there is a Light Novel to read and you can see from the manga it heavily improves apon the source showing how anime should improve the source.Ok let's get on to the main character in short are very expressive and a joy to watch. Rimuru's voice fits perfectly and for a slime it's(slimes are genderless) expressions are pretty wide for a slime. We even see how Rimuru effects the world and how he interacts with others. Also just to note It's an overpowered protagonist but isn't the most powerful in the land yet.The comedy elements work very well when melded with Slime's story and characters but remember comedy is subjective so not everyone will interpret it the same. From my experience it had me laughing out loud at certain adult jokes and character facial expressions. Other characters definitely have their momments and the interaction between characters are just great.This may be a light heart comedy at timed but it can get dark. From some isekai I've seen it can be hard to go from light to dark moments but slime pulls it off without out it hinder the anime it's self anymore and I would get into spoilers.In conclusion, That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime is a joy to watch. The animation and voice acting improves apon the source material. The characters interact well and in themselves interesting. It can get dark at times and does it well. I also hope you all will found this review helpful and enjoy the anime as much as I have.",

This one continually coming up on lists as one of the \"first\" and highest ranked examples, we follow Rimuru, a middle aged Japanese man who suddenly died, being transported and transformed into a small blue androgynous slime. Somehow a magic being in their head is able to answer any question asked and they quickly set about powering up and making friends. The series is bizarre, and like most in the genre I assume escalates quickly beyond recognition. This series it quickly begins to feel more like watching someone speed run the good karma storyline in a video game than it does a narrative anime, but I get some people are looking for that. A show that's truly afraid of conflict, any tension or disagreements are just as quickly resolved as they arise, and the power scaling just goes exponential the longer it goes on. The animation is done well I must say, especially the fight scenes, which there are a decent amount of, and I understand some might just enjoy this \"for the plot\". It can get surprisingly brutal, and equally surprisingly tame and boring. Its never really a comedy, but it also never takes itself seriously; I'm not sure what tone its ultimately going for. Frankly I can't believe I watched nearly 50 episodes and with a new 3rd season soon on the way, it passed the time I guess, but surprises me that its so highly rated. There's a million and one characters, and a bunch more subplots, which I'm sure might go somewhere by episode 463 whenever that comes but I just don't have the patience to wait till then.",

Before that, I'd like to note that I watched the title in Japanese with subtitles.At first glance it seems like just another isekai on the list, but you'll quickly realize that it's a bit different from the standard mix. It borrows a lot from characteristics usually found in video games, and that's something I really enjoyed. The anime introduces you to the story and world events at a very nice pace, and manages to move the story along at an equally good pace.The character design is really nicely done and the voice actors are no slouch either. They all do their job extremely well and the voices fit the characters. But not only the design but also the character development is 1st class. You accompany the characters and the anime manages to let even seemingly unimportant side characters swap every now and then and contribute their part to the story.Oh yes, the animation quality - for me an insanely important point, because only with a good quality an anime really becomes a masterpiece. And this one really doesn't disappoint in the slightest. I noticed some small details in the animation that are really not common and I really appreciate that.All in all, a clear recommendation for all anime fans out there.",

        "body":"Poorly written, horridly acted with painfully low-budget special effects... the Asylum Studios has productions better than this drivel. Even the ScFy Channel has produced better content than this. You can't blame anything this bad on the Pandemic.Hollywood loves trying new shows with strong female leads but Natalie Zea as the fawningly over-protective helicopter Mom is just disastrous. Her acting is heavy-handed and reminds me of Debrah Farentino from Earth 2. As the lead in this sewer circus, Natalie is just a dragging this show down the drain quicker than Debrah did to E2.Clearly the addition of Zyra Gorecki as daughter Izzy is a cheap PC attempt to cast an \"impaired\" actor who's better off behind a still camera. Her acting talents aren't even fit for commercials. Even though she appears to be able to work up tears on command, her facial expressions and execution of dialog don't fit the moment or the waterworks.Whoever was responsible for casting Eoin Macken as the Dad should be fired immediately. I can't really think of anything positive about his role or his talent in this part. I really kept expecting him to die in one of the early episodes... too bad.What can you say about Jon Seda as Sam and Nicholas Gonzalez as Levi other than they are simply just embarrassing. Was this a conscious effort by the production to cast such weak talent? Something that seems to be a trend in Hollywood over the last 10-15 years.Chiké Okonkwo as Ty is the only secondary actor that has any chops and it's too bad he's been relegated to such a minor roll.I watched 5 episodes of this garbage hoping that the cast would settle in to the roles and the writing and production would find their groove... no such luck. If anything, it's gone downhill. At the beginning I was intrigued by the concept but by the end of the 2nd episode, I no longer cared what happened to any of the characters and actually looked forward to a few of them being killed off... eaten or otherwise graphically dispatched.Unfortunately, this is exactly the type of brainless garbage that will be renewed for more seasons... but one can only hope otherwise.Stay away from this mind-numbing drivel... you've been warned.",

It seems like an LA thing though from so many films and TV shows I've seen.The show cross-cuts between two different scenes.The dad and husband of two of the victims has paranormal premonitions about what's happening and gets the attention of a shadow government agency that is determined to suppress the truth and conduct a rescue mission.Getting the lion's share of the action is the group of displaced people as they try to figure out what is happening in a loose rip-off of \"Lost.\" The crew includes a wide variety of professionals such that many are the deus-ex-machinas for each other's ailments. There's a kid with life-threatening injuries but fortunately there's a doctor among the stranded to rescue him. Ditto with a stunted child who's been trained to pretend she's mute and a child psychologist who needs to get information from her without traumatizing. Similarly, there's a paleontologist who can decipher the tea leaves and a cop who can keep order.The coincidental nature of each person's abilities isn't so bad but there's a clunkiness to the dialogue and the character development that's par for the course for standard broadcast procedurals rather than the middle brow serial this show aspires to be. This certainly slows down the show but it's marginally watchable and has enough potential that it's worth finishing the season.",

But after it got going, I found it really annoying. I don't care that it's utter nonsense, I'm willing to suspend disbelief for this type of subject. The problem is that most of the characters are truly awful - not only wafer-thin - but actually grating. While I like science fiction, and normally it does not feature Shakespearian levels of character depth, they can't just be \"The annoying talkative guy,\" \"The thuggish guy,\" \"The religious nut,\" \"The moody teen(s)\" etc. Etc. And while I'm willing to suspend disbelief about the whole story line, the things that didn't make sense at all - such as the degree to which people could recover from deadly injuries and can go on as if nothing happened - kept making \"looking the other way\" more of a challenge. I endured, though, as the underlying science fiction story is actually an interesting one. So by the time I reached episode 10 I was enjoying it - I never got the the point where I cared about what would happen to any of the characters, but at least I'd become used to the \"talkative guy\" etc. And I could more easily suspend disbelief at utterly nonsensical things, etc. I don't think it merits any awards for writing or acting, but by the end I found it to be just plain \"dumb fun\" and am looking forward to the second season.",

However the lack of professionalism with regards to ... lets say the \"special effect\" or over the top melodramatic flair I found to be hysterically entertaining and fun giving me a sci-fi schlock vibe though that was not the creators intent. I fond the show pleasant entertaining .I am a big fan of this kind of science fiction whether it's highbrow or lowbrow I generally eat this type of story telling up . I think the show showed potential letting the carnage loose and the weirdness of the La Brea tar pits turning into an alternate version of Los Angeles, full of tasty strangeness like prehistoric birds, early Homo sapiens , creepy low end CGI wolves and according to (Coast to Coasts radio ) Art Bell R.

I was mainly curious to see how they explain the falling into what amounts to unexplained time travel backwards but if they did it was after I gave up on it..For any who may not know this show is named for the actual, factual La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles. Tar pits where a large number of ancient fossils have been discovered. So this fictional show bridges off that, and the idea that a sinkhole might open up and people might be transported to an ancient time.Update February 2024: Tonight is being touted as the final episode when they return home.

In fact, I'll bet I could take a group of interested 7th graders and have them doing a better job in 30 days.I feel sorry for the actors who thought they were getting an exciting, innovative, network prime-time drama. It's difficult to fault some of the shoddy work we saw in the first episode: it must have been like being told you were getting a Maserati and then being handed a bottle of glue and a 1\/64th-scale, plastic, assemble-it-yourself model.There are no doubt episodes already in the can that are a sunk cost for NBC, so I'm certain those will air. But the best and most humane thing the network could do right now is cease and desist, and mercifully let this travesty be put out of its misery and vanish from memory once those already-produced episodes air.",

As a life-long nerd and dinosaur lover, I thought I could finally have a show that launched in ways that old ones like Terra didn't. Whelp. It didn't succeed in the way I was hoping.The overall concept is great, and there is some promising acting, but none of it can save the repetitive storyline plot points: crisis, run away screaming, try to discover some new time travel related mystery, internal drama, rinse and repeat. The other issue is the cheesy CGI. You can tell this has a lower production budget and I would be more forgiving of that if it wasn't for the tiring, worn-down, exhausting plot points.",

Every character had to describe every other character as \"the best of the best\", \"the best the agency ever had\", \"the best I've ever seen\".If you have to tell your audience someone is the best, then they are probably not. The writers are just getting in their own way with excessive dialogue when some simple staging would allow viewers to come to their own conclusions., Instead, we're being TOLD everything.Also, Queen Latifah is a good actress. She is, however, remarkably miscast in this series. The writers aren't writing to her strengths-- rock solid persona and strong delivery. Instead, they're trying to portray her as a seasoned fighter and are putting her in scenes where she's shown being physically violent. Those scenes fall flat due to the excessive jump cuts needed to compensate for the actress' lack of natural physicality. The classic 80's series did this well-- writing for McCall as a seasoned veteran in his late 50's vs. a modern spec ops warrior. As such, the original McCall used intimidation more than direct physical violence as his key weapon.This series could be saved but it needs some heavy reworking. Right now it feels like \"Equalizer in Name Only\". Branding this as a remake of the original series is a disservice to all involved. Instead, create a brand new character for your very talented lead and stop trying to retread the past.",

You are directly told what pretty much every character's traits are.The fight scenes are edited rather poorly as well. Jump cut after jump cut, it's not stylized it's just annoying.It's unfortunate because the source material is quite strong, but, this attempt is very weak. Perhaps it'll get better after a few more episodes but the first two were bad enough that I'm not going to stick around to find out.",

        "body":"This show just isn't for me. Latifah as an action hero is just laughable . Good action scenes in movies and\/series should be more then \"quick turnarounds\" and \"waving your arms\" which then magically turn out to be \"knock out\" punches. This show reminds me a lot of 70's shows when (bad) actors pretented to know martial arts but in reality just looked foolish, even then ...\nIt doesn't all have to be superrealistic but it shouldn't be like a cartoon either. This is the era after the Bourne films, John Wick, The Raid and so on.So if you are going to do a remake with Latifah as a lead, then why not just follow more the original where the main character uses his brain more then his fists.",

If a show has Med, PD, Fire, or Law in the title I want to see stories about Med, Fire, PD, and Law all with content related to those titles. The Equalizer falls into the category of too little Equalizing and not enough kick butt storie lines..... it needs to come up with unique plots and how she solves them, but that takes good writing and imagination, which is missing in this series. As noted by others, Queen Latifah is miscast here, I personally love her comedies but this show is a stretch.By comparison, the Denzel Washington movies bring a nice mix between the personal issues that cause the initial crisis, and how they are Equalized.

The premise of this remake doesn't divert too much from the show in the 80's or the movie remake brilliantly done by Denzel Washington.\nShe is the divorced mom with a teenage daughter who, per all scripts, has a contentious relationship with her often gone mother. She is spoiled and whiny which would by only critique.\nQueen Latifah is relatable female action star that we need. These roles are far to often given to men.

Perhaps they should focus on their racist decisions instead, such as giving Grace Park and Daniel Dae Kim inferior pay compared to the rest of the cast of Hawaii Five-O.Now, I've always liked Queen Latifah, but for this series, she's badly miscast. Even after watching the pilot episode, I just couldn't buy the fact that she's a former operative with \"a special set of skills,\" which would almost certainly mean that she would have had to have been a member of special forces. Much of her dialogue exchange with Chris Noth is about \"old times\" on various missions. In short, we aren't given a plausible explanation that explains her skill set, especially given her age. By the way, only as of February 2020 has a woman been set to pass the Special Forces Qualification Course.The writing isn't very good, which is evident in the overused number of times that cliched lines are given. Also, what is the point of blasting girlie hip-hop music everytime Latifah mixes it up?However, Latifah's performance is good, as is much of the rest of the cast. I also found her style of parenting refreshing as well.The Equalizer would have been much more enjoyable had they focused on her intelligence of being able to out-think her opponents (which she does do a few times) and less on her--unbelievably--mixing it up like some Denzel Washington\/Jason Bourne wannabe. In other words, make the show unique and give it its own identity instead of trying to imitate and copy everything that has already been done.",

Denzel killed this when he was the EQUALIZER so it makes me sad this show is unwatchable",

        "body":"It's great to see Queen Latifah back on the screen. I enjoyed the pilot but wasn't completely sold On the dynamic watching a kick ass woman who was a single mom but then part I didn't care for was that her kid was a rebelling teenage brat. The second episode found its footing and I really enjoyed the episode and the show after that point. Queen Latifa is a surprising choice for the lead in this series but her tough but soft charisma actually works great for this series. I love it, I hope it sticks around for many more seasons to come!***Had to come back to edit...although I previously liked watching Chris Noth in roles, now I can't.Also lowered the rating because although I do really like the show, the PC side plots are really too much. The daughter went from an unlikable little brat to now a wonderfully behaved teen? I guess it's the actress I don't like, wish it was cast with someone else.Other than that, I love all the other characters and although it's kinda unbelievable for Queen Latifah to be so skilled at fighting that she can knock out cold 20 cartel members at the same time, for some reason I love watching it happen. Lol. I do watch this show every week, I hope it gets renewed-there's not a lot of network shows I watch but this one I like.The CIA episode with the guy who was on chicago fire was one of the season's best! Please stick with the CIA storylines as that is where this show shines. The episodes with the PC story arcs give off an awkward, forced, boring, preachy and inorganic vibe. The spy team is what makes this show great!",
