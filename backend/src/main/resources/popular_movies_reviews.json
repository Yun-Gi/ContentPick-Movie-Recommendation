        "body":"Moana 2 is an enjoyable sequel that I saw with my 4 and 8 year old daughters. I would recommend it for anyone with children as they are likely to be held for the duration and enjoy it.The plot contains a lot of the same formula from the original movie (and Disney Princess animated features in general). This is not an issue, but for me what slightly disappoints is feeling shortchanged on story for what feels like the setting up of a third movie. On reflection (at the end) it feels like the slower character focussed aspects of the pre-adventure scenes (although good) are making up for the lack of material during the adventure. Compared to the original where the main antagonist had a fully realised character arc with a great twist, this one makes no contribution other than to pitch the next instalment. (There is a mid-credits scene so don't leave the cinema too early)That being said there are no weak sequences, spectacle or character moments. I like how all the characters are used, particularly Moana's sweet little sister and all the relationships portrayed between people. The underlying message of togetherness and connecting people is very worthwhile. The new slant on the Kakamora is great.As for the songs, I think, as always, it is a matter of taste, but for me they are not as memorable as the original.As always with Disney the animation is incredible and the voice performances are great.",

        "body":"The original Moana was a film that surprised me. I thought it was great. It was brimming with heart, humour, and unforgettable songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda. The performances, especially from Dwayne Johnson as Maui and Auli i Cravalho as Moana, brought the characters to life in a way that felt fresh. Naturally, I was eager to see how a sequel would expand on the magic of the first movie. However, Moana 2, while enjoyable, doesn't quite recapture the same magic that made the original such a standout to me.One of the biggest differences is in the music. With Miranda not returning to compose the songs, the sequel lacks the same level of musical brilliance. The new songs are decent and serviceable, but they don't have the catchy, emotionally resonant quality that made tracks like \"How Far I'll Go\" unforgettable. While the tunes in Moana 2 are pleasant, they fail to leave a lasting impression, making the musical aspect of the film feel less integral to the overall experience.The story, too, feels like a weaker reflection of the original. Without delving into spoilers, the plot revisits themes and beats that feel overly familiar, which might leave fans unsatisfied. That said, the ending provides a heartfelt resolution that ties everything together in a satisfying way. Despite losing momentum in the middle, the final act does a great job of recapturing the story's emotional core, leaving me curious about what future adventures could look like.Visually, Moana 2 is a feast for the eyes. The animation remains top-tier, with solid visuals of the ocean, lush islands, and intricate details that make the world feel vibrant and alive. While the sequel doesn't quite reach the heights of the original in terms of story or music, it's still an enjoyable watch. For fans of the first film, it's worth checking out, even if it doesn't fully live up to its predecessor.",

        "body":"\"Moana 2\" has to be one of the most unexpected sequels in recent memory. It only came to my attention earlier this year when Disney announced they retooled a TV show that continues the original film's story into a theatrically released sequel. That's not even mentioning that they're releasing a live-action remake in 2026. The original \"Moana\" is an incredible film with spectacular voice acting from Auli'i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson as Moana and Maui, dazzling animation, iconic songs in \"How Far I'll Go\" and \"You're Welcome,\" a legendary side-character in Schaffrillas...I mean Tamatoa and an engaging narrative. I was curious to see how a sequel would work, and after seeing it, I realized one hard truth: I'm not the target audience.For the positives, the voice acting is still remarkable, with Cravalho and Johnson again delivering energetic performances. Even though the story is not the strongest, which we'll get to, their work manages to get me somewhat invested.Of course, the animation is phenomenal. Disney films have always been known for their terrific animation, so it goes without saying that \"Moana 2\" is no different.While this film does not have as many memorable songs as the first, \"Can I Get A Chee Hoo?\" is hands down the standout. The song doesn't reach the heights of the powerful \"How Far I'll Go.\" I don't think it will become as well-known as that song, but I enjoyed it.For the remaining positives, three solid jokes landed here, its mid-credit scene was delightful, and the film is not that long. Sadly, negatives prevail and weigh down the experience - for me, at least.Although the runtime was short, I was bored even more than \"Gladiator II.\" Many factors I'll mention possibly led to me thinking the movie was tedious, but its pacing left me dissatisfied.I also felt the villain fell flat, not as much as The Rock's other release this month, \"Red One.\" I won't reveal who it is to avoid spoilers, but I didn't feel the threat from the film's antagonist.So I don't over-critique it, I'll bring up one more point: I felt the narrative was weak. The setup of Moana going on an adventure to unite the islands seems simple at first, but the overall handling of that story comes across as convoluted. Said convolution leaves me with no investment in potentially emotional moments.Overall, \"Moana 2\" didn't work for me. I don't think it was unnecessary, but it didn't entirely justify its existence. It's simple and inoffensive yet oddly forgettable, so it's a fine enough trip to the movies. However, I'm not recommending this in favor of \"Wicked\" for the Thanksgiving holiday season.Technically, outside of issues with the story, the animation remains stunning, the voice acting is stellar, and the music is well-done yet average from my perspective, so the technical score is an 8\/10.For the enjoyment score, it is a standard sequel that has enjoyment but a standard sequel that is undeniably weaker than its counterpart. For me, the enjoyment score is a 5\/10. Again, it is okay and will leave you interested to an extent, but I'd recommend waiting until Disney+.",

        "body":"Compared to the first film, I would say it falls short, it is very difficult to surpass the standards that were set with the first release. The film was very enjoyable, there are 1 or 2 songs that were really good and the plot follows very well the narrative line that was proposed to us at the end of the previous film. I really appreciate that it paved the way for a sequel. Dspite that, it feels like the plot, especially at the beginning of the movie, was forced to pave the way for what would happen, making it very predictable, therefore it was difficult to get emotional. Personally, I think the film deserved a little more time to study the script and the characters. Many things feel out of place. Even though it has its small flaws, the movie is really good, the graphics are beautiful, the audiovisual effects give you goosebumps and you really get fond of the protagonist. Therefore I highly recommend watching this movie and make sure to watch it with headphones if you're going to do it at home, because it will greatly improve the experience. I will be waiting for a new release, as long as they take their due time to make the sequel since it is preferable to wait for the Moana 3 experience to be the best they could have done.",

The firm is set well after the events that have changed Moana's destiny in the last film, and leads firmly into where she and here people must go next.Thankfully, even with a nice runtime, this is not rushed, the new cast gets used good and proper, the songs are snappy and fit well, and yes Dwayne Johnson does sing too, and has settled int well for voice work so expect more. Good that Aull'i Carvalho is back as Moana, and really runs with it.You have three writers and directors working on this, sounds chaotic, but it works out just fine, and does not feel episodic, the ocean and sea life is never dull looking, and the whole soundtrack fits in and not in the way as are the songs, this is a very good sequel, even if I didn't want one, the story has plenty of room. Just have to wait and see how this performs in the coming weeks of December, now.A great animated Disney film that has noting political or stupid messaging in it, pure entertainment and a one for IMAX if you can catch it there.

For context, I rewatched the original a few days ago, in anticipation of seeing the sequel, so both are very fresh in my mind. If you haven't seen the original for a while, I honestly can't see that as anything but a plus.This movie builds on the mythology and world of the first. Moana, now a celebrated wayfinder, is tasked with finding a specific island for the sake of her people. She recruits some new (very fun) characters, but some old friends return too. (And yes, I am the sort of simple person who laughs every time Heihei does something)I particularly liked how the characters have aged since the first movie (Moana's parents have grey hairs and crow's feet). And while there are numerous callbacks to jokes from the original, it doesn't feel like too much.On to the important part: the songs! I personally judge musicals by the amount of songs I want to rewatch\/rehear as soon as the credits roll. In this film I counted three original songs (not to mention the gorgeous incidental music and callbacks) that I could play on repeat. Which is pretty good for a new Disney movie, in my case.TL;DR: It's a sequel that doesn't feel unnatural or unwarranted. Some great songs, some new characters to love. Give it a try.",

The visuals are stunning, the story is okay solid (U'LL LOVED THE LAST 20 MINUTES), and there are plenty of fun, heartwarming moments. But let's be honest-the music just doesn't hit the same way it did in the first movie.In the original Moana, Lin gave us absolute bangers like \"Where You Are\" and \"You're Welcome.\" Those songs weren't just good-they were unforgettable. They added so much life to the movie and stuck in your head (in the best way). But in Moana 2, the songs feel... fine? They're okay, but there's no wow factor, no song that makes you want to immediately add it to your playlist (except for Beyond 😉).Still, it's hard not to miss the kind of music that made the first Moana so special. If you're a fan of the first movie, you'll probably enjoy this one too, but you might find yourself wishing for just one more Lin-Manuel masterpiece to hum along to.",

        "body":"Let's face it. The first Moana was amazing. Great soundtrack, great characters, great character arcs, and it was fun for the whole family. It was one of those movies that didn't need a sequel, because it was just perfect.Unfortunately, I can't say the same about its follow-up.Moana 2 felt soulless. It felt as if there was no heart behind it, unlike its predecessor. Each song that was sung (except for 1 or 2) wasn't that great. They weren't catchy, and didn't make me excited for what was about to happen!And the side characters...where do I begin?I couldn't tell you their names, even if I tried. They felt unnecessary throughout the movie except in very few scenes. It was just all so forced. We're given basic information about them and that's it. They don't really have any character development, and if they do, I don't feel like I know them well enough to care.There are also some plot holes. There is a scene (and to avoid spoilers I will be as vague as possible) where we're introduced to a character who has been trapped by the \"villain\" of the film. (Why I have quotes around villain, I'll get back to later on.) After her 5 minute introduction, she is left behind and we never find out what happens to her, even after the defeat of the villain.To get to my point on the villain, he was barely introduced. All we get told as an audience is that he's a power hungry god and that's it. We get barely any exposition, and the final battle is so fast. It felt like so much build up for nothing.Not a lot felt like it changed for Moana and her character by the end of the film. The stakes just barely felt like they were there.Which also reminds me, the pacing for the movie was very off. Some scenes felt so fast while others took their time, and it gave me a weird feeling of not caring as much as the first film, although I wanted to care.All in all, it's not the worst film ever. It's a family flick, that your kids will probably enjoy, but for me personally, it's definitely not one that I'd watch more than once.",

The fact they didn't have Lin Manuel Miranda really showed in the music. You're welcome was written perfectly for Dwayne Johnson but this time around, his lack of singing skills really show.I think kids will love this movie, with the cute characters and fun call backs.

A randomly weird new character gives her terrible life advice that steers her to make irrational choices that bring her success. The voices were good but the songs didn't wow. They were definitely not as good as the original soundtrack of Moana; felt more pop in style with less local color. The songs weren't memorable. We all kind of groaned when they sang again.Some cute and funny moments. The kids laughed a couple times. The other feelings felt manufactured- like they were trying really hard to evoke emotions in the audience rather than just letting people feel in response to the story itself.Moana is kind of a narcissist's love song and the other characters don't get filled out much. She saves the day all the time and has all the ideas, skills, enthusiasm, gumption, and smartness, whereas everyone else just muddles around not being as brave, smart, capable or bold. She talked about teamwork but it seemed like the other characters (other than Maui) were just foils. Moana was kind of annoying and Maui wasn't as well-developed this time around. The villains don't get much development either. The plot is kind of disjointed and meanders; I can see how this was originally conceived as a Disney+ series. Nice animation though, neat textiles; the animation of the woven sails and her hair were well done. Some fuzzy feeling family hugs; it was nice to see a whole family portrayed positively in a Disney movie. It wasn't awful, it just was a little flat despite the feeling that they were trying very hard. Maybe it felt a bit like a commercial for a new round of toys.",

The emotional core is painfully missing with this one. None of the musical numbers have you at the edge of your seat like How Far I'll Go, or choking up like the Song of the Ancestors. It's beautiful enough to look at, but without a good story to ground it, it makes sense that the characters, the music and the overall experience falter.

Its origins as a TV show are definitely felt in the very choppy first act where no scene is allowed to last but it thankfully finds a better rhythm afterwards as it actually begins to feel like a film and then comes together nicely in the third act.Auli'i Cravalho gives it her all as Moana again, bringing as much emotion as possible to her new songs and every scene with Khaleesi Lambert-Tsud as her adorable younger sister is heartwarming to counterbalance the fact her journey is so much weaker here. Her new crew are mildly annoying even if they all find their purpose by the end and it needed way more of Awhimai Fraser. Dwayne Johnson is still charming as Maui but all the flaws and vulnerability have sadly gone.After the shaky start, directors David G. Derrick Jr., Jason Hand, and Dana Ledoux Miller make sure the film feels epic enough to warrant a cinematic release and the visuals during the musical numbers are suitably inventive. The animation is the one aspect that comes close to the original thanks to its stunning detail and vibrancy from beginning to end. The new songs don't come close to the quality of their predecessors and the score is only memorable when reusing previous work.",

The voice acting is great, the story is entertaining, and sometimes it's fairly funny. But it definitely fell short of the expectations I had for it. The first film, Moana (2016), was clever and funny and had an emotional and interesting story. Moana 2's story, while entertaining, was paper thin and missing some key elements. Moana 2 tries to be as emotional as the first, but sometimes feels as if it's telling the audience to laugh or cry instead of letting them feel their own emotions.Moana 2 is not bad. I laughed a couple times and I enjoyed the film. It is aimed at a younger audience than the original film, but that's expected.

Anyways, I just finished watching Moana 2 (2024) and it was decent.Positives for Moana 2 (2024):\nThe animation looks just as good in this movie as it did in the original. Auli'i Cravalho is still great as Moana and she continues to be the heart and soul of these movies. I enjoyed seeing her teaming p with other people from her tribes on this adventure. The Rock is still just The Rock and he does great in that role. And finally, you get some more great action sequences in this movie.Negatives or Moana 2 (2024):\nThe musical numbers aren't as good or catchy as they were in the original. The story isn't as interesting as the one from the original. And finally, a lot of the new characters aren't developed enough to get me to care about them.Overall, Moana 2 (2024) is a decent enough sequel to the original, but it is also a sequel that shouldn't exist.",

        "body":"Just saw \"Moana 2\", the sequel to the 2016 Disney animated film \"Moana\". Once again featuring the voices of Auli'i Cravalho and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, it is a subpar follow-up that delivers visually but not narratively.Three years after the events of the first film, Moana (voiced by Auli'i Cravalho) happily spends her time visiting neighbouring islands hoping to find others who share her ability to connect to the ocean, but to no avail. One day, Moana receives an unexpected vision from her ancestors where she learns that the reason no one connects to the ocean anymore is due to the storm God Nalo sinking the island Motufetu responsible for linking all of the islands together. In an effort to reconnect the ocean with mortal beings, Moana assembles a crew of her people to assist her on a journey to locate and raise the sunken Motufetu to the surface. Meanwhile, the demigod Maui (voiced by Dwayne Johnson) is on his own separate mission to find Motufetu because of his personal history with Nalo, but soon ends up captured and held prisoner deep inside Nalo's underwater lair.Joining Disney's official line of Princesses back in 2016 was the strong-willed Polynesian Moana of Motunui. Brought to life by the refreshing vocals of then-newcomer Auli'i Cravalho, Moana's heroism and relatability has since seen her worthily earn a coveted place among the iconic canon of Disney Princesses. However, Moana's adventure towards greatness could not have been accomplished without the help of Maui, the tattooed demigod whose shapeshifting abilities complimented the titular hero's journey on both the humorous and informative front. The enjoyable pairing up of these two allowed things to conclude on a satisfying note, but since Disney values dollar signs over leaving well enough alone, a sequel was naturally green-lit to continue the story whether audiences wanted it to or not. Now in \"Moana 2\", we are treated to a nicely animated yet rather uninspired follow-up that does little to stir up the same level of excitement as the original.The film's biggest problem, in my eyes, is that it never fully invests the audience in its surprisingly flat story. As three years have since past, we see that Moana has now embraced her title as chiefess, exploring different islands, albeit, without Maui's help. She has grown since her last adventure, but never so much that she forgets how to be compassionate towards all living things. Soon enough, Moana learns that her island home is in danger of becoming fully isolated from all the others unless the missing link island Motufetu is brought back to the surface. For no other reason than to set the plot in motion, Moana goes off on yet another journey to save her people from disappearing forever, at least that's what I assume the story was about. Unlike the first film, which was able to captivate the viewer with an intriguing look at Polynesian culture, this one's contrived plot device of a sunken island feels more like an afterthought as opposed to a legitimate way to invoke a sense of adventure. Because of this, most of the magic has been lost in the creative process.Additionally, with the introduction of a new batch of characters, the film doesn't properly develop them beyond either convenient helpers or a cheap punchline. For instance, one of Moana's crew members Moni (voiced by Hualalai Chung) is shown to be a devoted fan of Maui, constantly gushing over how amazing and powerful he is. Most of the time, Moni's sole purpose is simply to remark how much he wishes Maui was part of the crew, usually resulting in repetitive visual gags that only hamper the flow of the story. Similarly, another crew member Keke (voiced by David Fane) is a grumpy farmer who frequently bickers and complains about everything that happens on their trip. What could have been someone amusing that reluctant older audiences can relate to is instead a bland, one-joke character who failed to raise even the slightest smile out of me. As much as I tried, I just could not find any interesting supporting characters that are able stand out significantly alongside Moana herself, leaving her as the only person in the entire movie with anything worth watching.Worse still, the dynamic between the title character and the loveable demigod Maui is decidedly lacking. This can be chalked up to the fact that the two hardly interact with each other until about halfway through the movie. One of my favourite things about the original film was watching Moana and Maui learn to work together as a team. Their relationship was hostile at first, but over the course of the story it blossomed into a genuine friendship between these two unlikely heroes. For some reason, the writers of this film have decided to split them up since the events of last time, with Maui off doing his own thing completely independent from Moana. Most of the time, Maui is reduced to being an obligatory prisoner character with little else to do but make weak jokes that often miss the mark. When the time comes for him to be rescued by Moana, his shapeshifting powers frequently malfunction, rendering him fairly useless until the climax of the film.Fortunately, not everything in this movie is a complete failure. Like with the original, the visuals and animation are quite impressive at most times. I actually really liked this one shot near the beginning of Moana looking out over the ocean and using her hand to help navigate the position of the stars. This can be interpreted as showing how much Moana has grown in terms of intellect, utilising her attuned nautical knowledge to size up a situation wherever necessary. Also, even though they aren't as memorable as before, the musical numbers help move the film along at a reasonable pace to prevent too much drag. It's just a shame that there aren't any major songs that leave a lasting impression, except for maybe \"Beyond\", which stands out primarily due to Auli'i Cravalho's passionate vocals rather than the content of the lyrics themselves.If I had to single out just one consistently great thing in both the original film and this sequel, it would be Auli'i Cravalho's voice performance in the lead role. Though not much has changed from last time, there's just something instantly watchable about the way Cravalho brings to life Disney's first Polynesian princess, embodying all of her courageousness and humility to a tee. It's actually refreshing to see a female lead in a Disney film who isn't afraid to work in harmony with others as opposed to wanting to do everything all by herself to prove that she doesn't need any outside help. Even during the film's weakest moments, it's near impossible not to care about what will happen to Moana due to the sheer amount of personality Cravalho is able to draw out from the character, something highly important when portraying a member of Disney royalty.However, the same cannot be said for Dwayne Johnson as Maui, who isn't used as well in this outing as he was previously. While Johnson does his best to contribute some comic relief, it just feels like the writers didn't know what to do with his character this time around to make him seem any different from how he was in the original. The only thing that comes to mind is the reason why he wants to raise the sunken island all by himself without Moana's help, and that is because he wants to shield her from danger. Apart from that, if it weren't for the fact that he was so prominent in the first film, it's quite easy to forget his presence in this follow-up.Though not without its fleeting moments of fun, \"Moana 2\" ultimately proves to be an unnecessary sequel that adds barely anything notable to the expansive lore laid out in its predecessor. Unless you're a hardcore fan of the original film, there isn't any real reason to go out and watch it on the big screen, though it may be worth checking out on Disney+ if you are curious enough. Up next for the series is a live-action remake of the first film, and judging by the quality of Disney's recent efforts, it's probably nothing to get excited about. With that in mind, it's not like Disney has many new things to offer us anyway, so you can either take these films for what they are or leave them. Personally, I think we should leave them.I rate it 6\/10.",

A sequel that introduces a bunch of new characters, gives a returning character a power upgrade and a slightly new look, but otherwise just replays the same story beats as the previous movie, and drops a major plot thread halfway through, only to pick it back up in the sequel-bait mid-credit scene.Don't get me wrong, it does all of that on a high level of craftsmanship, the 3D effects and Dolby Surround bells and whistles are a ton of fun, but nothing this sequel brings to the table is groundbreaking, original or deep. \"Can I get a Chee Hoo\" ia a nice song, but even that doesn't even come close to the bangers in the first movie.And my stomach aches at the thought of Disney just openly pumping out franchises now instead of movies.",

They've got a master farmer (on an island where they grow food) a ship builder\/designer (on an island where they use boats) the muscle and the coconut lol they make complete sense, if she'd have gone with stereotypical sailors you'd have 6 identical people indistinguishable from each other. I cannot understand why people create fake reasons to criticise and think it's justifiable, it's almost slander.Next was the music wasn't as good, it's not easy to produce bangers, most musicians struggle with this, however 2\/3 are really good, maybe not as catchy but that doesn't make them bad, if a song is iconic, being very good isn't a negative, just a tough act to follow, again weird criticism. It doesn't link to the first... well all the few reviews I saw this in, they link it all the way through the start, from the lad telling the story to the ocean scene with original music to grandma\/coconut and tattoos, I don't get how it's not linked? It needed a new villain and a different story, it had a great one that was different, bit more grown up and engaging.Even the sister gets criticised, one reviewer kept saying everything was a retcon (word of the day toilet paper) she was a good addition and replaced the grandma as her heart on the island without needing a boy or love interest, she was uber cute and funny.The film is great. I've watched it 3 times, the extras are awesome, bacon and eggs especially are iconic and for me Moana is up there with the best IP that Disney have, I enjoyed wish , not as much some of the others, I thought inside out 2 although good was needlessly depressing for kids where as this is bright, vibrant and sends positive messages,Is 10 too high? I mean personally I enjoyed it 3 times in a week, I can't find much outside tiny bits to be remotely critical of.If you hate stuff, don't go and watch it, if you don't watch it then don't review, it's clear as day when nothing you say has depth or any valid points outside of generic opinions you've borrowed.Every good review I do seems to have to address unfair hate, don't get me wrong, read some 4\/5 out of tens and I'd not argue with how they felt, they explained and that's fine, but flooding 1\/10s is just tedious.This generation's determined to make the world the most boring it's ever been.",

At least not to the same extent.Moana 2 is similar to a walk in the park to distract the little ones while the parents have some peace.This walk certainly shouldn't be a waste of time for them and probably not for the parents either, since there is enough movement, color, humor and music to disguise the lack of ideas.The film is concerned with following the model of contemporary animations in the speed and volume of jokes, action scenes and use of music inserted into the story in exchange for capturing your attention, instead of winning it over with a good narrative.The absence of Clements and Musker is palpable.

I wasn't very big on \"Moana\" as while I loved its colorful animation and finding the concept to be pretty good, I found myself feeling disconnected with its themes and found the characters to be uninteresting to connect with. With this sequel, while its colorful animation remains high and there are some new concepts that I do appreciate (like exploring some different cultural aspects within the world of Moana) I found myself having the same problems as the first one.For starters, Disney once again provides wonderful character designs, sound designs, colors, and animation models as there are some gorgeous background colors. Many of the voice performances are solid with their emotions and personalities expressed. Regarding its writing, there are some new concepts I do appreciate and thought were pretty good, but unfortunately, it ends up being too simple that it ends feeling too safe and engaging to fully sink into the world of Moana.I never really connected with the characters. Don't get me wrong, the character of Moana is definitely a good inspiration for children and I understand the creator's intentions and their goals, however, I found most of the characters to be uninteresting or pretty annoying, particularly the character of Maui who I can't really stand. The writing is bland as certain concepts could have been explored a bit differently but failed. As a musical, most of the music writing and singing are surprisingly pretty bad. Many of the music notes and the lyrics are pretty bad and none of the music, unlike the first one, had much memorable scores.Overall, Disney sequels are rarely done well as they never really seemed to re-capture the essence of what made the first one good.

The pacing was a bit off, but the plot was good and upped the scale from the first movie. The songs were good, although they were a different tone than the first movie. The new characters were good and funny, but I wish they could've been fleshed out a bit more. The animation was gorgeous! The colors and flow were amazing to see. The writing was good and there were some good laughs during the movie. I actually enjoyed this movie and would be excited if they made another one, or a Disney+ show based off this movie.",

The missed the mark by introducing too many new characters that didn't connect with the audience and recycling jokes from the first movie, not to mention the lackluster soundtrack - why they didn't bring back Lin Manuel Miranda for this one is a mystery, as his catchy melodies and his vast array of musical influences are what made the first Moana's soundtrack an absolute standout.

The animation is absolutely breathtaking, with vibrant colors and incredible attention to detail that bring the ocean and islands to life.The story delivers a beautiful balance of adventure, humor, and heartfelt moments, making it a memorable journey for audiences of all ages. I found myself laughing at Hei Hei's hilarious antics and melting over Pua's adorable moments. Moana's personal growth and the introduction of new characters added even more magic to the already beloved world.The songs, while not as iconic as the original, are still powerful and beautifully woven into the narrative. 🎶 The themes of courage, self-discovery, and connection are inspiring and left me feeling uplifted and in awe.This movie is a masterpiece and a must-see for Disney fans and anyone who loves an emotional and visually stunning journey. I'd give it a solid 10\/10!",

        "body":"Moana 2 was originally supposed to be a TV show; the resulting story is so tightly compressed that there is little time or space for drama and character development. What the filmmakers substituted for these crucial elements is a heavy handed slathering of magic that comes across as the movie equivalent of a 100 minute Disney park parade - oppressive in its relentless exuberance. Don't get me wrong- magic is key to Disney storytelling, but those moments have to be earned and they aren't in Moana 2. When the premise is always apocalyptic (as it is with recent Marvel movies), nothing real is at stake and the outcome is never in doubt...and we stop caring about the human consequences. When everything is magic, it ends up that nothing is magical. This is very much the same malady that doomed Encanto, and something Disney will have to reckon with if they want their brand to continue to be viable in the long term.",

Our kids had a good time so that's all that matters, but they're pretty easy to please, bright colors and silly animals is about all it takes. Also there was a scene with a new \"villain\" that didn't get resolved, just sorta moved on to the next big \"conflict\" of the movie. They brought back a couple of the old songs which was nice.

        "body":"I am very attached to the first Moana, and it's always a film that I come back to when I need a mood lift or something to distract me from the problems of the world for an hour and a half, so hearing about the sequel got me both excited and nervous, as the first is really important to me.Firstly, just to clarify, it is really good and I did thoroughly enjoy the movie, and I do see myself watching it again.So, starting with the bad, I have a bit of a bone to pick with Matangi, she is the weirdest and most unnecessary part of the film, I really wanted her to have a villain arc, and she really seemed perfect to have some sort of an evil plan or sudden shift in mind, which really would have been so good and would have drastically improved the main conflict of the story, instead I'll just call her \"a potential gone to waste\", she was on the screen for a couple of minutes, than she was gone and no one remembered she was there. She also had the only song that had zero Polynesian influence, which was a bit awkward compared to the rest of the movie.Secondly, the main conflict didn't seem to have enough tension, or not as much as it should have had (although the part right after it was an improvement) if the god would have gone down from the sky to fight them or at least made things a little harder than the tension would have been felt so much more, but it was still tense, just could have been a little tenser.Thirdly, the writing got a little weird and too \"zoomer coded\" at some parts, and would have loved it more if they were just a bit more raw rather than sounding like 2014 born children at a couple of parts (although the writing was also wonderful at some others and I laughed on so many occasions)Lastly, the ending was a bit rushed, with all of the other sailors arriving to the island, as much as it made sense, could have been a more gradual process and I would have loved it way more.Now onto the good (don't worry there's a lot of good)Firstly, the Polynesian theme sticks hard and I love it, it really feels like they are trying to be traditional with their music and the theme and I'm living for it, especially because it is such an unrepresented culture worldwide and Moana really helps shine a light on the Polynesians.Secondly, the visuals are amazing, and the movie itself is gorgeous, the animators have really worked hard on it and I can only applaud them for the visual masterpiece.Thirdly, the songs are still great, and I really enjoy their Polynesian theme, it was one of my favorite parts about the first and it really is no different, still absolutely beautiful.In addition. I did criticize the writing a bit, but I can't deny that they still did a really good job overall, and there were so many genius moments and funny jokes and I am ready to forgive their sins because the screenwriters really did a good job in the end, also, the new characters traveling with Moana were very fun and it felt like each one of them has had a moment and they still felt like an integral part of the film, which is good because characters like this tend to feel a little awkward and useless at some points.Overall, I had a good time, and I would like to go watch it again and see if there are a couple of things that I didn't catch last time (I'd like to think Matangi has a meaning and I just didn't understand it). And I'm pretty sure the ending did try to set up a third movie (and also the mid credits scene foreshadowed a little) so we'll see, but yeah, I think it really deserves a watch, but go form your own opinion :)",

It did have a lot of the charm of the first one missing so it felt like a worse version of the original Moana. Here's the best and worst about it.GREAT:\nThey expanded on the world of Moana and this added to the overall stakes of the film. The new side characters are pretty awesome and a lot of the jokes and gags were pretty funny. The humor is one of the best parts of this movie. The story is also pretty good. It's not as good as the first but is better than most of current Diseny. The arcs that the Moana goes on is pretty enjoyable to watch. Also the coconut is the best part of this movieBAD:\nThe music in this film is not anywhere near the other one. They list the guy who made the music in the first and his presence is severally missed. I would rather have no music in this movie than the music we got. Also the paceing is pretty bad. It was originally planned to be a tv show and there are some, very few, times you can see that in the pacing.If you want diseny to make more original movies this will not be for you. As the time of writing this has broken numerous records at the box office. I can even see this in my family. The last time we went to watch a Diseny movie in theatre's was Frozen 2. It's sequels from here I'm afraid. If you like the first Moana you will most likely enjoy this. I had a fun time but the music really dragged my rating down.Farewell.",

However, that safety does not allow the story and this sequel to go a step further to try to innovate in new attractions, although it has a fresh and emotional story to its credit, it also suffers from a couple of gaps in the journey towards its outcome, which takes away from the intentions of a sequel that is charming in any case.The familiar characters continue to give us fun moments, Moana is still a great Disney character, and the studio continues to outdo itself with brutal, sensational and masterful animation, full of colors, textures and lights that visually make Moana 2 a step further in subtlety. As for the music and its songs, perhaps it is quite lacking, but a couple of songs do their job, although not enough to stand out categorically.In short, it is a family adventure film full of excitement and visual wonders that focuses on the youngest members of the family. A nice message runs through its veins with a plot that is more complex and dark, but that has a current and pertinent message, which makes Moana 2 a fulfilling and correct film that will leave the vast majority happy and others somewhat less motivated, but in no case offended or upset because the film has a formula that will leave everyone included because it is a proposal that will not offend anyone, rather it will involve everyone.",

They just became helpers but not really significant enough to love them. Then the first villain...which ends up not being ...(never mind) lol that was like a pointless character. It should've been 1 bad villain. The story line was underwhelming. She needed to bring people together? Maybe the people of the island should've disappeared and her mission was to rescue to them but instead you don't know who the other people are. It was just too much distraction going on between the 2 villains and the 3 new characters that I didn't love and didn't serve any purpose. Hopefully part 3 is better. It's hard to beat part 1 but if Frozen was able to be just as good in their part 2 then Moana should've been just as good. I don't know what Disney was thinking here with this one. This story was underdeveloped and just watered down. The songs were awful too. Not catchy either. The best part of the movie was the last 10 min. But it was a huge work up for nothing.",

        "body":"A lot happens in eight years. And yet, much like the first movie, Moana 2 meets the moment. Its alternative title could have been \"Moana and the Gathering Place,\" as the story centers on the titular character, Moana, bringing the people of the ocean together, connecting their bonds and breaking a centuries long curse that keeps them separate and apart. In doing so, Moana transcends being a heroine and becomes a true hero, culminating in her demi-deification.The story is helped in large part because Moana isn't like most Disney heroines. She's not a princess (a point repeated in both films). Most princesses will one day become queens and rule their people. But Moana is more a vice chief, someone who has started their rule, albeit in a smaller capacity, and will one day graduate to full chief. In this role, Moana has more responsibilities than most other Disney heroines, and therefore more respect and admiration. She isn't loved for her youth or beauty or kindness; instead, she's revered for her decisiveness and experience.As much as we often put our leaders on pedestals, we also forget that they too are only human. Moana literally needs help from a demigod and the ocean on her quest. She puts too much pressure on herself, feels every mistake, and despairs at the apparent hopelessness of her purpose. But the ocean's people can only survive together, and Moana chooses to persevere at any cost.In that way, Moana 2 is a retelling of Disney's Hercules. But Hercules focuses on the man, where he belongs and how he can return to Olympus, reaching it only by becoming a true hero. Hercules becomes a god once again (if only briefly) after a selfless sacrifice-his life for Meg's soul. Moana, on the other hand, puts her people first (and, by extension, all the people of the ocean). It is for them, not herself, that she makes her selfless sacrifice. And because of her people, she is granted her divinity.Thus, the themes of Moana 2 are that leadership requires sacrifice; that the goal of bringing people together, and thereby defeating the forces that fracture us and keep us separate and apart, is a righteous quest; and that divinity comes from putting other people first. During these fractious times when so many forces try to separate us from each other, Moana 2 reminds us what true leadership means and that we are all stronger together. If we can't find a way to reconnect, our story too might end.",

        "body":"\"Moana 2\" tries to build on the massive success of the original, but despite the potential of its premise and the natural expectations that come with a sequel to a contemporary classic, it ends up sailing into lukewarm and predictable waters. Visually stunning, as is standard for Disney animations, the film leans heavily on its impeccable aesthetics but lacks the substance needed to make this journey truly memorable. The story, characters, and even the musical moments fail to recapture the impact that made Moana such a beloved milestone for kids and adults alike.Set three years after the first movie, \"Moana 2\" follows our heroine on a new mission: breaking Nalo's curse, which has isolated several islands and their cultures. At first glance, the idea seems promising, especially with its potential to delve into rich cultural themes and expand on the mythology of the original. However, the plot drags, bogged down by an uneven pace and an overfocus on secondary characters who add little to the story. Kele, Loto, and Moni, introduced as Moana's new allies, have shallow arcs that fail to engage or build an emotional connection. Worse, the dynamic between Moana and Maui-such a crucial and heartwarming element in the first film-takes far too long to reemerge, reducing the impact of a relationship that should've been the backbone of the narrative.The adventure itself also stumbles, never really taking off. The sense of discovery and triumph that defined the first film is replaced by conflicts that, while visually impressive, lack depth and urgency. The coconut tribe and the giant mollusk are examples of sequences that could have been exciting but end up feeling like episodic detours with little relevance to the overall story. It's clear the script opted for a safer route, shying away from the boldness and freshness that made Moana's initial journey so unforgettable. This reluctance to take risks leaves the narrative devoid of any genuine sense of danger or personal growth for Moana, which is particularly frustrating in a story meant to reinforce her role as a heroic and inspiring figure.If the narrative disappoints, the soundtrack is one of the biggest letdowns. The original film became iconic thanks to songs like \"How Far I'll Go\" and \"You're Welcome,\" which not only captured the spirit of the story but also became cultural anthems. The new songs in \"Moana 2\" are fine but far from memorable. Maui's \"Can I Get a Chee Hoo?\" is fun and will probably charm kids, while \"Beyond,\" the recurring theme, tries to establish an emotional connection. However, none of them come close to the impact of Lin-Manuel Miranda's compositions, whose absence is keenly felt. Without a standout soundtrack, the movie loses one of its most powerful tools for touching the audience's hearts.On the bright side, there's no denying the visual appeal of \"Moana 2.\" Disney continues to push the boundaries of technical excellence in animation, and this film is no exception. The oceanic landscapes are breathtaking, with water so lifelike you feel like you could dive right in. The character designs, from Maui's tattoos to the quirky coconut tribe, are incredibly detailed and creative. Even the dullest parts of the story are visually captivating, which certainly helps keep younger viewers engaged. However, this visual beauty often feels more like a distraction than a narrative extension. Without a story that matches its splendor, the stunning animation feels like a luxurious wrapper with little substance inside.Overall, \"Moana 2\" is a sequel that plays it far too safe, and in doing so, undermines its ability to captivate and surprise. It checks the boxes with high-quality visual entertainment but lacks soul, emotion, and purpose. For fans of the original, it might serve as a nostalgic reunion with Moana and Maui, but it's unlikely to be remembered as anything more than a pale shadow of the first film. By choosing not to take risks, Disney delivers a product that fails to capture the magic, depth, and cultural significance that made the original a true classic. If there's one lesson to take away from this, it's that no amount of technical brilliance, no matter how spectacular, can replace the need for a well-told and emotionally resonant story.",

So I've been counting the days and dreading, and when I heard the runtime I was even more distraught. I wanted to hate this movie with every bone in my body for a few reasons.1. Not a fan of musicals (but I can grimace through them sometimes).2. I love Wizard of Oz in its purest form and didn't want the legacy of it spoiling.3. My wife's choices of films are more often than not 'questionable'.4. Two hours plus in a cinema seat these days doesn't do my back any good at my age.5. Ariana Grande.Now being a realist my first impression of the movie might be a little offset because I went in with such low expectations as I've done this before on numerous occasions, but call me a softy in my old age (I'm 47) I absolutley loved it!!! Everything from the phenomenal soundtrack, set design, make up, costumes,comedy elements, character design etc...i could go on, you get the gist. It was brilliant, I may even go watching it again (the highest accolade I can give for a two hours plus movie) and I can't wait for part 2. A few purists have got thier complaints and gripes which there will always be on adaptations of previous pre-loved formats. But no complaints here, just a very good, well made movie. Wizard of Oz's legacy intact.One more point...Ariana Grande steals it for me. Perfect casting!!!",

        "body":"I saw the prescreening of the movie yesterday and saw the musical in London's West End years ago. In both cases what a show!I have been waiting for this release since the original project had Stephen Daldry tied to it and he exited due to \"scheduling conflicts\". Winnie Holzman iwrote both the book of the musical and the screenplay. She shines in both instances, however the movie being longer than the whole muscial (160min vs 150min), and representing only act 1, she had the chance to put in more layers and definetely more humour.Director Jon M. Chu does not miss a brat with this amazing aource material and screenplay. He makes the best use of Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande's singing talents and also directs them in surprisingly nuanced acting performances. Jonathan Bailey is a nice (looking) addition to the cast and adds bravado and the right level of conflict and wonder with his character.After the adequate first 20-30 mins, we get the power of \"The Wizard and I\" song to secure our OZ immersion. The rest of the movie is a blur of brillamt scene after scene and spectacular visual renditions of other beloved songs like \"Popular.\" and \"Defying Gravity\".I had high expectations for the music but was even more impressed by the storytelling, acting, editing and visual effects. A lot of marvelous details down to the peculiar language of certain words in the screenplay to make it one of the best movies of 2024 (Oscar noms for sure) and one of the best movie muaical of all time. Can't wait for part 2 next year in movie theaters and may have to go see it in Broadway live again before thatMoreover (and not a small point) the underlying message of resilience and resistance to fear-mongering authority, falsehood and justifications, divison, oppression and manipulation of public opinion is much needed in this decade of deceipt.Free speech and democracy?Let's all Defy Gravity!!!",

Not only are the songs infectious and emotionally resonate, but the acting from the cast is equal to the strengths of the music. The movie is visually striking, and though it's a lengthy runtime, the journey the viewer goes on is well worth the trip, leaving one enthralled when the \"To Be Continued\" pops up on screen.What is also unheard of for a movie musical is being a two parter. I wouldn't be surprised if Wicked: Part 1 sweeps this year's awards, and Part 2 does another sweep, something that is unprecedented in the history of movies.",

Every scene she is in I couldn't help but laugh. There is no doubt in my mind that she'll be nominated for an Oscar and hopefully brings it home. The last scene\/song by Erivo is breathtaking and I cannot stop thinking about it. Even though it's a bit long at two and a half hours it certainly flies through it and every frame is magnificent.

I am a hetero male, married to a beautiful wife, have three awesome kids and our whole family is in love with the theater... we go see Peter Pan in Dallas later this month. I say all that to say this... Wicked is easily in my top 5 musicals on Broadway, also holding number 1 of my all time favorite moments in theater (Defying Gravity at the end of Act 1). It would've taken perfection for this movie to attain the level of respect for the movie version.... AND IT WAS PERFECTION! Maybe the greatest movie of all time, definitely the best musical movie of all time.Let's start with cinematography... Holy Cow! Absolutely stunnin. Colors, camera work, zooms, pans, fades... it doesn't get much better. Even the CGI wasn't distracting.Story: this movie tells the story of Wicked much better and fluid than the play does... properly so, they have more ways to do it. But it follows the book a little more as well.Casting: I don't think I've ever seen a movie, short of The Patriot, that every person was perfectly cast... until this one... and not only perfectly cast but embodied the role better than anyone could have. I felt every emotion Elfie was going through, so much that at the end of the movie, I had to catch my breath. Ariana Grande is the funniest Glinda, the Gah is silent, that could have been. She was perfect! Goldblum, Yeoh, Bailey, Slater, Bode played their roles excellently. Even the nod to Keala Settle and Erivo back together since Greatest Showman, nicely done.Music: Wow, just wow! Bringing back Schwartz, the original composer with a full theatrical orchestra to pull it off was breath taking multiple times within the movie.I can't wait for Act 2 next November and this will be purchased the first day it's for digital. Go see it... my words don't do it justice.",

And that it was!The performances, especially by Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, are Oscar-worthy. We see a whole new side to their insane talents and what they're truly capable of doing. Throughout the film, I had forgotten that it was Ariana as Glinda, because I saw her fully embody this role in the way that she said she would. She is HYSTERICAL and the whole theater couldn't stop giggling. Cynthia is an absolute powerhouse that left me left speechless after each star-studded performance. Having followed her journey for a while now, it came at no surprise the amazing beauty and strength she gave Elphaba. Together, they were radiating power, friendship and emotion.The chemistry of the entire cast was lively and formed an environment that felt ethereal, along with the groundbreaking visuals of the settings! Wow. Just wow. It was beyond believable, and felt as if I was there, immersed in this world of Oz the entire film. And no, the trailers do not do this film justice and they don't spoil ANYTHING!The musical numbers were traveling throughout my heart and soul, and it was an out of body experience that I will never forget.This deserved two parts, and I see EXACTLY why it was split up. Yes, the film is long, BUT there is never a dull moment that arises. Each scene, each exchange is filled with its own magic.Ariana, Cynthia, Jonathan, Jeff, Michelle, Ethan, Marissa, and the entire cast truly put their own unique twist on the songs, on the characters, all while paying homage to the original and to the Broadway show.To Jon, this is what real cinema is. The camerawork and directing was something I had never seen carved. You have shattered the bar and allowed for more creativity to flow through and take over. Transcending time, going above and beyond the status quo and bringing us into the story. You absolutely nailed it and left no room for error. You truly defied gravity.Bravo!",

Throughout the progression of the film, I kept waiting for the moment when the movie became an instant classic in my books. Unfortunately, it never did. With a 2-hour and 40-minute run-time, Wicked left me feeling drained. The vocals of the leads were immaculate, the props were grand, but it still felt incomplete.In terms of casting, Cynthia Erivo proved to be a wonderful pick for Elphaba, in both acting and singing. She also garnered much sympathy for the plight of her character and the challenges she faced due to her skin-color. Ariana Grande held her own as Glinda bringing various quirks and a unique comedy to her character, especially with her and Erivo's chemistry. Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero was surprising and fresh, though it felt as if we never received a deeper understanding of his character. Most of the supporting characters seemed more superficial, and not as easy to connect to. The motivation for the villains seemed incomplete especially when centered around the subplot regarding animals. Every set-up in the movie seemed to lend itself to a set up for another song or \"you'll find out in part II.\"There were moments in the film where it felt rushed, and times that seemed to be drag. Toward the final act, I loathed the idea of hearing another song. The plot seemed increasingly thin and unable to hold my attention. For a musical, most of the songs were forgettable, minus the finishing number 'Defying Gravity.' Admittedly, not all musicals need to have memorable songs if the plot is strong enough to carry it (e.g. Newsies), but the plot itself seemed just as forgettable. The run-time of the film should have produced a better understanding of the characters and a stronger plot. However, it merely presented a song-fest, with a weak plot and many choreographed dances.Overall, it is still a watchable movie despite its few flaws and bloated run-time. But there are many others who do believe it is the best piece of cinema ever seen so maybe it's just me?",

The Emerald City sparkles, and Elphaba's powers are brought to life in mesmerizing ways.The movie is predictable and overly long. The story, reframing Elphaba as a misunderstood hero, is predictable, and formulaic, leaning heavily on the tired trope of a mistreated woman seeking justice against \"the man,\" with the Wizard cast as the villain. Big surprise, right? It seems that's all Hollywood can manage in most of its makeovers.The lack of surprises makes the plot feel repetitive. It's so predictable that it's one of those movies where you can make a couple of concession stand trips, come back, and not miss anything important. Also, don't worry-you'll still hear the loud music blaring from the lobby.The music, though central to Wicked, becomes overwhelming. Loud, drawn-out ballads dominate the film, slowing the pace and overshadowing the plot. A few standout songs would have been more impactful than the relentless vocal performances. At over two and a half hours, the movie also feels unnecessarily long, dragging in the second half. While visually impressive, Wicked struggles to balance adventure with substance, leaving it more exhausting than magical.",

Whilst I had my complaints (specifically around the second act), there was no denying that the music and sets created something magical that I am happy to say Jon Chu has managed to capture with this film.Both Erivo and Grande give enchantingly memorable performances as the leads. It was clear both actresses took the time to think about how these characters should transition from stage to film without feeling silly or misrepresented. The supporting characters also all gave strong performances and fit their roles well.The production design, costumes, and makeup in this film are all excellent. It does a great job of transporting you to the land of Oz and it was clear there was a huge amount of attention to detail.The musical numbers were never not entertaining, with an energy that allowed the choreography and set pieces to shine, as well as the performances.This film is only half of the story and ends the same way as Act 1 from the original musical. Similar to Dune, I feel this was poorly advertised, and may leave some people feeling mislead or unsatisfied.The CGI in the film is used sparingly (mostly for the animals), but at times did feel distracting.Overall this was one of the best musicals I have seen in a very long time, and I am excited to see what they do with part 2.",

This film stays so true to the story of the first Act of the show, and adds some parts that elevate the story rather than spoil it.Ariana Grande-Butera felt like a stunt casting when it was announced. I LOVE her music, but she's a pop star, would she do Glinda justice? I didn't think so. She was utterly perfect. The operatic singing was outstanding, her comedic timing was pleasantly surprising and her acting was just perfect.Cynthia Erivo.. ive seen her in interviews and promos for the movie and other than a brief role in a series called Chewing Gum around 10 years ago, I'd not seen her in anything else. I'm not sure how I feel about her as a person, but as Elphaba, she was outstanding.

As I sat there stunned with the rest of the audience on Monday, the only word I can think of is \"gobsmacked!\" Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande were perfectly cast and managed to make Elphaba and Glinda their own while literally paying homage to Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth. Grande is exceptional at comedic timing (anyone who's watched her on SNL knows she's hilarious); but, it's when there are more nuanced moments between her Glinda and Erivo's Elphaba where she is at her best.

On balance it makes for a perfectly watchable and entertaining enough experience, but it could have and should have been so much better.To start with the positives, Ariana Grande is absolutely magnificent as Glinda. I was sceptical about her as a leading actress but she really smashes it out of the park. Vocally she is spot on. Her mannerisms and dialogue delivery are perfect. She truly eclipses every other cast member and just is Glinda in every way.Aesthetically in terms of costuming and set design, again I think this film nails it. The commitment to practical sets and a reduction in green screen technology is noticeable and it does create a more engaging look to the film.Finally the production value of the music numbers is all really solid. Apart from dragging out Defying Gravity for a bit too long, I think the songs are all brilliantly performed and well choreographed.Now for my gripes...The whole thing is just far, far too long. Two hours and forty minutes? There is simply no need. Not only this but somehow, despite all this extra breathing room, the film doesn't carry as much emotion in its story as the theatre production. I felt like the plot points around the animals and also of Elphaba wanting to meet the wizard, just didn't carry as much weight as they should. There was just too much time between the emotional beats of the story due to the added run time, which lessened their impact.I can't argue that she has a great voice (and she nails Defying Gravity), but I just wasn't convinced by Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba. Perhaps this is on the director's shoulders, but she was just played a little too reserved and shy and was incredibly hard to connect to. I know this is part of the character of Elphaba, but even still the whole performance was just too muted. It doesn't help that she was performing across from a great Glinda.Another annoyance is the colour palette of the film which is disappointingly dull. Given the technicolor wonder of The Wizard of Oz, I was hoping this film would pop a little more on the screen. Glinda's pink dresses, Elphaba's green skin, even the Emerald City itself... they just all felt a bit dull.Still, none of these gripes are terminal. If you enjoyed the stage show of Wicked you will love this film. If you love musicals you will enjoy this film. Even if you are just a casual movie goer you will find plenty to enjoy here. I do just think given the source material there was maybe a better attempt to be had here.",

It's that good.While knowing The Wizard of Oz enhances your experience of Wicked, by no means is it necessary. Wicked is a rousing fairy tale stuffed with production values, like the art deco design faithfully integrated and a full retinue of eccentric characters, like Oz himself well-cast with Jeff Goldblum slightly holding back as if to let the story and visual delights take over.Thematically the story is itself well stuffed, especially the help from my friends' motif, where Glinda (Ariana Grande) and Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) go through stages of development from competitors to sisters, each in her own way. The film doesn't allow secondary characters to develop as fully, but the two principals are satisfactory for storytelling needs.Along the way director Jon Chu with writers Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox keep their eye on the diversity angle, especially verdigris Elphaba's ostracization, which allows the characters themselves to evidence the hatred of those not the same by race or color. The most egregious example of racism is the attempt to imprison talking animals with the escape of the monkeys, who have grown wings under Elphaba's magic.The Land of Oz is not unlike our own SA filled with well-meaning souls like Dr. Dillamond, the professorial goat captured for speaking out. Trends today in super powers like Russia and the USA to suppress freedom of speech seem most realistic. Nevertheless, while savaging bigotry and exalting friendship are prominent, the overarching joy is the fairy tale fully alive with performers and production perfect for holiday joy for children and adults alike.Elphaba: \"No wizard that there is or was \/ Is ever gonna bring me down!\"",

I enjoyed Wicked, the characters are great, but I am concerned, because I have no idea how they become the characters they are in The Wizard of Oz. The songs are very well-written, I enjoyed most of them, but I felt that a little less would've been better. The dialogues were also great, sometimes forced. The main theme is right in the audience's face, that might be frustrating, but the theme of acceptance is still to this day, very important.The movie is well-directed, shot and choreographed. The dance scenes were captivating. The visual effects looked awesome, but I would've loved to see a little bit more practicality. The editing isn't bad, but I definitely think the movie's greatest weakness is its pacing, it's way too long and there's a part two, which I' looking forward to though. The acting performances are great, and the best is definitely Cynthia Erivo's.Wicked is visually spectacular, but too long.",

Ariana Grande dazzles as Glinda, comedic timing and vulnerability perfectly balanced. Their chemistry ignites a poignant exploration of friendship, prejudice, and self-discovery.

Nowhere except for in the cinema did I see the film advertised as PART 1-not in the advertising, not in the cinema listing, and not on the marquee. I don't think I would have gone knowing there were more parts coming. And since Wicked was just as long as a musical and had a beginning, middle, and an end in that same amount of time, it means that they should tell the entire story in about 9 hours. Yes the creativity of the sets and the CGI of animals were amazing, and the leads were pretty good especially since they had big shoes to fill. Cynthia & Ariana held their own, and Ariana may have a second career as she was awesome on SNL as an actor. Jonathan Bailey was a standout for sure, and can obviously sing and dance and came across as completely swoon worthy. Bowen Yang gave the film some camp and humour. But I guess we have a couple of more films to give a solid rating. Is it a 1\/10?-no, that's too harsh, maybe not your cup of tea or too long.

        "body":"If you are primarily interested in movies without being a fan of the original Wicked musical or this particular IP, I would take these somewhat strangely overwhelming positive reactions with a grain of salt. It's nice to see people enthusiastic about big Hollywood extravaganza but this is far, far, very far away from a masterpiece which is so forcefully implied by many major media outlets. First of all, this being Part 1 with a running time of 160 minutes while the whole original musical was shorter than that, tells you enough about the intentions and corporate machinery behind this project.The positive side besides perhaps 2-3 musical numbers being fun and charming are the performances from Cynthia Orivo and Ariana Grande. They have nice chemistry together and they are obviously great singers. Jonathan Bailey also has fun screen presence and I definitely wanted to see a bit more of him. Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum aren't doing that much here, typical paycheck gigs, no more and no less.Story is fine, I guess. It has super basic messages about acceptance, being true to yourself, standing up and, and... really basic stuff without any ambiguity to it. However, the pacing is atrocious, film dragged at times and an obnoxiously pedestrian editing didn't help at all. After some time, I simply wanted it to end - again, this is Part 1, so spoilers - it won't end until November 2025.And how are the visuals? This is one of the worst looking big studio movies I have seen in a very long time - think Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland mixed with MCU's bland colour grading and horrendous lighting that makes everything artificial, soulless and flat. It's astonishing how even the prettiest practical sets can be demolished with post-production in wrong hands. This is a movie where visual components are crucial, it should create that cinematic and magical sense of wonder - remember beautiful Technicolour vibrancy in 1939s Wizard of Oz? Well, that's replaced with the ugliest colour palette you can find in modern film.Wicked (Part 1!) will be a hit, it's tailored to be, forced into being the ultimate crowd pleaser but the fact that such an unimaginative and borderline lazy and toothless filmmaking is so highly praised, called even a MASTERPIECE, that's the reason why mainstream film industry isn't about art, creativity or originality anymore, it's almost exclusively about corporations creating marketing juggernauts and pleasing the target audience with the safest and the most basic content without the ounce of artistic instincts that are usually needed to mold motion pictures into art. Just like Sir Scorsese once commented on these huge riskless crowd-pleasing corporate events, this is not a cinema, this is something else.",

        "body":"To my surprise, \"Wicked\" was my most anticipated film of the year. Sure, movies like \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,\" and \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice\" held my curiosity and cautious optimism, and I had the same feelings toward \"Wicked\" at first. However, the fantastic trailers won me over to the point where every time they played before another film, I couldn't help but get excited. I've never seen the original Broadway show, but the Judy Garland-starring \"The Wizard of Oz\" is my childhood. I even saw its dark yet enchanting unofficial sequel \"Return to Oz\" and Sam Raimi's Tim Burton-esque \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" in preparation for this. The hype is real, so I would be upset if it fell flat - but it didn't! The film fan and critic in me loved \"Wicked,\" and I'd like to talk about why.The acting and singing were stellar around the board. Cynthia Erivo was spectacular as Elphaba, the titular Wicked Witch of the West. Erivo brought gravitas when portraying the human side of the famous villain, especially considering this film is her origin story. I also can't forget Ariana Grande as Glinda. Musicians have always had trouble transitioning into acting, with Eminem's performance in \"8 Mile\" almost always in the conversation of artists who succeeded. I've seen Grande in other films before, and her role in \"Hairspray Live!\" was entertaining, but these performances haven't proven her as a professional. \"Wicked\" changes that, as this interpretation of Glinda seemed to have Grande in mind from the start, and it's better because of it. The rest of the cast performed skillfully, with other standouts being Peter Dinklage as Dr. Dillamond and Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero Tigelaar. Bailey steals the show, as Tigelaar is an incredibly whimsical and hilarious supporting character who may win you over.I have to give proper recognition to Director Jon M. Chu. He directed this hugely ambitious, large-scale tentpole like a pro, and I respect him for accomplishing this possibly wearying task.Even though studios nowadays try to hide that these movies are musicals, the trailers didn't entirely cover it up. As a musical, it was outstanding. See \"Joker: Folie à Deux,\" this is how you do a musical! All the songs and ensuing musical sequences were extraordinary, with \"The Wizard And I,\" \"Popular,\" and \"Defying Gravity\" being the highlights for me. The songs are paired with impeccable choreography, costume, and set designs from Christopher Scott, Paul Tazewell, and Nathan Crowley.The CGI was unbelievable, bringing many elements, including the animals, to stunning life. It enhances the magic feel of this film, and the fact the movie cost $145M overall and had exceptional visuals is jaw-dropping. Speaking of which, I'm sorry, \"Mega-flop-olis,\" though I still think your visuals are mind-blowing, \"Wicked\" has taken your title as the most impressive film visually this year. It goes without saying that \"Red One\" spending $250M might have resulted in great visuals, but how they spent less here is more commendable.Regarding the narrative, it wonderfully flips the original Wizard of Oz story on its head. Again, this is the story of how the Wicked Witch of the West came to be. There is a sense that the gleeful characters we knew from the original may have helped the Wicked Witch become her namesake.Additionally, I laughed many times. In particular, Erivo, Bailey, and Grande's characters have hilarious exchanges that made the entire theater I was in laugh, and I couldn't help being part of that crowd. Dana Fox and Winnie Holzman deserve credit for having a remarkable screenplay.Finally, the runtime was surprisingly well-utilized. Before going into detail, I must mention why I had cautious optimism about this film before the trailers. There are two reasons: this was part one of two, and it runs at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I was unsure if this film would drag or have any unnecessary scenes. After seeing it, I am pleased to report I wasn't bored or upset with any of the scenes or pacing decisions. Very few films have this runtime and utilize it flawlessly.In conclusion, I fell in love with \"Wicked,\" and it is difficult for me not to. In a year with incredible films, \"Wicked\" manages to stand above most of the rest and is one I feel has a strong chance of winning the Oscar for Best Picture.Technically, the performances from actors like Erivo and Grande, the breathtaking visuals, M. Chu's magnificent direction, the script, and the pacing add to a 10\/10 masterpiece.For the enjoyment score, we rarely see a film outside of animated features that appeal to all audiences. I believe that younger and older audiences alike will love this absolute treasure. The enjoyment score is a well-deserved 10\/10! If this is one of the year's best films, \"Gladiator II\" has a long way to go to be the victor of \"Glicked.\" This musical is a must-watch in theaters, and I can't wait for \"Wicked Part Two\"!",

Unfortunately - not on the Broadway stage - but at The Buell in Denver.Is the movie perfect? NO. That's why I am giving it a 9. It is a little long; but after seeing the play - I am not sure what they could have cut out. The play runs close to three hours WITH an intermission. There are no special effects in the play - you must use your imagination (which is one of the reasons why a play is fun). NOW ON TO THE MOVIE!They did a wonderful job of taking a highly successful play to the big screen. The special effects are really good and enhance the telling. They did not spend too much time on any aspect of the story. The music. The acting. The singers. All really good. No - not all singers are great singers! I loved Michelle Yeoh singing. She's not a singer - but she did a great job. Same with Jeff Goldblum.For the record - this is not the Judy Garland Wizard of Oz. This story is based on a book by Gregory Maguire. It tells the story of how the Wicked Witch and Glinda came to be the Wicked Witch of the West and the Good Witch of the North. It has no Dorothy. No cowardly lion. No tin man. And NO scarecrow (stay tuned for part 2 ... that's another story). The witch Dorothy's house falls on is in part 1 - but that won't be explained until part 2.I was quite concerned with the casting chosen for Elphaba and Glinda - but was very pleasantly surprised. They both were wonderful. Ariana Grande shows just the right amount of innocence, self-importance, conceit, selfishness needed for Glinda. Cynthia Erivo shows Elphaba's lack of confidence, lack of self-esteem, wallflower personality. Fiyero's lack of caring, mindlessness et al was perfectly portrayed by Jonathan Bailey. Again - stay tuned for part 2 to learn more.This movie is fantastic! Go see it - but DO NOT expect The Wizard of Oz. It's not THAT story. If you go expecting it - you will be disappointed. If you go expecting to be entertained ... you will love it. Pay close attention ... the original Elphaba and Glinda from Broadway gave cameos.

I love the music and the musical and it was so hard not to sing along. Chu is such a good director and so glad they got him to direct yhis movie. It has been 10 years since I've seen the musical but he seemed to stay true to the Broadway adaption of the book. I can not wait until part 2 or when I can watch this at home and sing and dance along with the movie. Don't miss this in the theater, it is so big it needs to be experienced on the big screen. Fabulous job everyone!!!",

Now, the singers were great, and I can't deny the cast's talent, but as far as the timing and pacing of the film, it gets a significant deduction in stars for me.I don't love musicals, but having written that, I can't say that these productions are something I automatically shy away from.Three hours is a helluva long time to listen to and watch a movie with so much singing and nearly no dialogue outside of song lyrics.To its credit, Wicked is shot cleanly and beautifully, and the balance of singing and character acting gets better, in my opinion, in the second half of the movie.",

She was very good but there was just a little something that was off for me. The final song of defying gravity was very strung out and by the end Cynthia's note (which isn't my favourite way of singing it) was very much, come on get it over with please. I think the filming choice did her a disservice on this song.Ariana Grande started off strong and I thought she was going to be excellent however I found she became quite one note as the movie progressed. She had moments of greatness but didn't go all the way for me.The whole film was very drawn out, in order to make two movies. This meant it lost the pace and drive that those who have seen the musical will remember. There were periods of time I was board watching.The cameos with Menzel and Chenoweth were misguided. I understand the sentiment and the reasoning and as a fan I wanted to see them in this film. However the moment was forced and distracting to the movie. There must have been a better way to showcase them.Just my personal gripe... Why is Boq taller than Glinda?This film had great potential but for me it missed the mark.",

I cried at multiple other points which i wont say for the sake of spoilers. I cried at the ending. It was an overall ethereal out of body experience. I left the cinema feeling reborn. As someone who has never watched\/read wicked before, im so annoyed that ive been missing out on this MASTERPIECE for years.

The level of effort and obvious passion put into every aspect of this movie is astonishing.The main two actresses completely knocked it out of the park. Grande's Galinda is a showstopper you keep on waiting for to reappear on the screen. I was never really convinced of her acting abilities before, but now it's the complete opposite case. Ariana Grande has so much more to offer through musical and film than solely the popstar gig. Cynthia's Elphaba is striking and powerful. While she gets kind of overshadowed by Galinda in the first half of the movie, she completely takes over later on.I can't wait to see the two of them performing \"Defying Gravity\" at the next Oscar's ceremony. It's a moment certain to happen.I'd also like to point out what a heartfelt actor Jeff Goldblum is. Completely in love with him.I'll be back at the cinema asap rewatching it 😁",

Two hours and forty minutes will delight some, but for me, the story and production weren't tight enough to keep me engaged to the end.From this novice's viewpoint, the editing was done with love rather than with a view to creating a tight film.

It's not my favourite Christmas film by any stretch but I enjoyed watching something a little bit different but still had lots of Christmas magic within.It's very much an action\/adventure\/Christmas film all rolled into one. The storyline centres on the main characters quest to locate and return Santa Clause after he is kidnapped. Lots of adventure and jokes along the way. Some hit and some miss!Like all Christmas films of this nature, just enjoy it for what it is. These types of movies should never be about real life but just immerse yourself for 2 hours in a world of action and magic.Overall, a solid 7 out of 10 for me. Not the best or worst film I've seen but for this time of year it is certainly one I'd recommend.But as I always say, don't worry about reviews! Everyone will see the same thing differently.

The cast brought a lot of energy, and Kiernan Shipka stood out as the evil witch;That said, the characters didn't have much depth, and the movie had this odd mix of feeling like a kids' film that isn't really for kids. Dwayne Johnson's character as E. L. F was a quite fun fit. This movie was giving my boyfriend and me plenty of laughs throughout.

It should be commended for that alone. Not quite the well executed violence of Violent Night, Red One takes a more light hearted approach with its dark action fantasy that can cater to a broader audience. It did this by attempting to combine action, with a heartfelt message and Christmas lore. Although it faltered in its execution mainly due to plot points, CGI and not fully capturing the Christmas spirit, the ambition of the film should be commended and it was boosted by performances from its lead cast. Whilst it won't any prestigious Xmas shortlists, it's a stocking filler that can be enjoyed at family gatherings.",

I think at this point being 100% original with Xmas is almost impossible, technically Arthur Christmas did a military style execution but for me if it's similar I don't care. I just like enjoying films.It's easy to watch, not remotely boring, acting is standard but this ain't a film winning those kinda awards, it's fresh, modern and creative, my only slight issue is it maybe alienates under 12s with the language depending on your opinion.I wish people would lighten up, just give things a go, don't go in so bitter and looking to hate, if you read reviews it's easy to pick out genuine distaste to someone just bashing it for non logical reasons, anyone saying 6\/10 or under is a Krampua.Be a red one.",

He had ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST in that child at all but suddenly we were ambushed with him desperate to rescue him when he didn't even want to pick him up from school an hour earlier.JK Simmons and particularly Lucy Lui were wasted on this really with their bit parts and their salary should have been invested into a more credible actor for the villain to give it some gravitas.I wasn't heart warmed by this movie or even remotely excited at the prospect of Christmas, it may as well have been released in July for the buzz it created.People fell asleep put it that way.",

After Santa Claus is kidnapped, the film introduces us to a layered and continuous world building, they took great pains to show us all the luxury and grandeur of that universe, where the locations look quite colorful. The North Pole is to be given a futuristic glow, where the snow never stops, and the joy and happiness never stops with stylish architecture, while the Krampus abode exudes dark buildings from the distant past that are surrounded by statues as if they fell out of a nightmare. Dwayne Johnson as Callum was quite, his character began to doubt that people can improve or be better, and he struggles with this throughout the film. While Evans left a fair impression in the role of Jack, who is a master of finding people or any things, but his private life is in shambles, the dynamic between the two is filled with good moments, especially when they try to connect more deeply, but occasionally the whole impression is very superficially generic. Dialogues. Lucy Liu is good to see and she gave us some bad ass moments. The mythology is in full imaginative swing, with unexpected appearances of some famous creatures, to the way some of them have an intriguing history together, it brings intrigue. Action scenes can be excellent, but they can also lack a little convincingness, because cgi can gain in some areas, but the final conflict was quite well thought out and wrapped in excitement.",

        "body":"I can guarantee to you the second you hear both \"Dwayne Johnson\" and \"Christmas\" you know the whole plot. I wasn't expecting anything different to what we got. Heading to the theatre very sceptical over what I would be coming to see but I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. I thought Chris Evans was amazing however, he seemed like one of the only parts of the film who genuinely enjoyed himself throughout the shooting. He played how I knew and thought he would be dumb fun stupidityThe film is hilarious in my opinion I mentioned Chris Evans but Dwayne was decent and he two of them balance their specialties and traits perfectly that of course being action-comedy. I honestly couldn't see a genre come off working with these two besides that. Action is strong with decently co-hersed fight scenes, of course nothing new for the pair. J. K. Simmons for me is one of the weaker depictions of santa clause we have gotten in cinema, just doesn't feel like he fits into the film well especially for a PG-13 setting. The gold medal for my far and away favorite sequences in the film has to go to the Germany Krampus scenes Kristofer Hivju plays the Anti-Hero in stunning light and is a breath of fresh air for this film and offered a fairly good heap of comedy in the film.But on the opposite end of the spectrum Gryla is so ugh. Dull, boring and nothing new. She's literally just a microcosm for the entire film something we've seen before muffled over with a Christmas blanket. I do wish we get something more for Dwayne Johnson across his film career instead of just fight, action, fight.",

        "body":"North Pole Head of Security Callum Drift has to search for Santa Claus after he has been mysteriously kidnapped. Drift must team up with level four naughty lister Jack O'Malley in order to track his whereabouts. The two men learn that they need to stop a greater evil who wants to make the world \"nicer,\" by targeting anyone who has ever been naughty.Oh boy... let me start with a couple of positives. Chris Evans is by far the best part of the movie as he is the only main actor who looks like he is having any fun with this movie. He has a few fun moments and a somewhat heartfelt speech to his son. Evans is not amazing, but he is kind of fun to watch. Kristofer Hivju is pretty fun as Krampus and his makeup for the creature looks fantastic. It is by far the best looking part of the movie because of the interesting design and solid practical effects.Some of the technology in this movie is pretty cool, such as the guns that freeze people and the gadgets that can turn toys into life at a much bigger size. I really liked listening to some classic Christmas music especially the songs from Mariah Carey. It is so fun to listen to her versions of Santa Claus is Coming to Town and Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) on the big screen. The ending is really cool because it has the most Christmas spirit in the story. There is a scene where a guy gets possessed by the villain that made for some campy fun expressions and line delivery... yeah that's all I got.This is a 250 million dollar Christmas themed blockbuster and all it had to do was be entertaining to watch. Red One is one of the ugliest and most joyless blockbusters I have seen in years. It also might be the worst movie I have seen in theaters over a decade. First of all, this movie is so ugly to look at in nearly every frame. For a Christmas movie, the colors look so drab and monochromatic not fitting the theme of the film at all. It looks like a bland made for TV movie for the most part. The CGI is not great and some of the creatures while they have cool designs look pretty fake. What really makes this movie look awful though is the lighting. It is one of the worst lit movies I have ever seen and it drags all of the visual aspects down. Not only does the lighting make the cinematography look even plainer than it already looks, but it is so dim-looking that it makes it harder to make out what is happening in the action scenes and visuals. There some really cool creature designs and makeup that are shown in the worst lit rooms.Speaking of which, the action scenes are subpar at best. Some of them have a glimpse of fun with how they use the gadgets and how Cal and Jack defeat their enemies, but the fights are poorly shot and over-edited. The climax has some moments that look cool, but the lighting is so dim, it is hard to make out what is happening and to enjoy it. The first chase scene is laughably bad effects-wise and again with dim lighting. Even if you wanted to just watch this movie for some cool Christmas action, you will be disappointed with what the movie offers.The story could have been this awesome Christmas spectacle with some heartwarming moments, clever use of Christmas mythology and Christmas cheer, but instead it is a bland cliched road-trip comedy with corny dialogue and a lot of scenes with Chris Evans and Dwayne Johnson talking in the car. It is an overlong quest to find Santa Claus with two unlikable people bickering at each other nonstop who only at best learn to tolerate each other. There are so many chances this movie has to show off some cool moments of Christmas mythology in fun ways and it wastes all of them except for the scene with Krampus.The tone of the movie is really corny as I feel that this is a kids movie that got the PG-13 rating just to be a little edgy at times and to say a few curse words. The humor is very cringeworthy with only a couple lines of dialogue or gags making me chuckle at best. I think I may have a chuckled more at Madame Web than this. The bad comedy just makes this movie that already feels too long drag on even longer.This movie has a solid cast but aside from Evans and Hivju, they either have bad performances or they are wasted. The Rock plays as the same character as he does in most of his movies, but he is oddly more unlikable and stoic here. Dwayne Johnson looks so bored to be here. Despite a lot of his excitement around the film in promos, it does not show in his acting here. It does not help that his character is nothing more than a boring plank of wood that exists to argue with Evans' character. Even fans of The Rock will probably have a hard time enjoying him in this movie.I said Chris Evans is one of the few bright spots in the movie and I stand by that, but that is more for him as an actor than his character, Jack. Jack is not a likable protagonist at all to put it lightly. He is a terrible father who never shows care for his child until the plot requires it, he is dismissive towards pretty much every person he talks to and he is a criminal who only does the right thing because he is forced to. There are some sweet moments with this character and he has some of the funnier lines mainly because of Evans' delivery, but he is overall not a likable or sympathetic protagonist.Another problem with this movie is that Johnson and Evans have no on-screen chemistry. They always bicker and the banter is not witty or fun to watch. These two men seem like they would rather hang out with anyone else than each other. It does not help that one actor is playing as a plank of wood and the other is doing his best to make an unlikable character charismatic.One my biggest complaints with this movie is how it unforgivably wastes J. K. Simmons as Santa Claus. Simmons is capable of turning any role into gold no matter how bad the material is, but this movie shoves him aside and gives him absolutely nothing to work with after the first ten minutes until the end. The worst part is that the few scenes with Simmons in it are really fun and kind of heartwarming, especially when he is chatting with kids at a store. Simmons could have saved this film if he had a bigger presence, but he is shoved aside for most of the movie. Why the hell would you even cast Simmons at this point if you are not gonna utilize him properly?As for the rest of the cast, Lucy Liu phones it in as the director of M. O. R. A. in just about every scene she is in, but she does at least gets a cool fight in right before the climax. Bonnie Hunt as Mrs. Claus is okay, but she gets little to do. Garcia the Polar Bear seems like he would be a fun character, but he is barely in the film despite being heavily advertised. Then there is the villain played by Kiernan Shipka. Her motive is interesting on paper trying to punish anyone who has ever been naughty to make the world \"nicer.\" The problem with this is that she ultimately becomes a bit generic in the final act and breaking free of the her punishment is a little too easy. Grýla is far from the worst villain I have seen, but she could have been so much better and Shipka's stiff performance does not do a whole lot for me.Although this movie has some nice Christmas tracks throughout the runtime, the musical score by Henry Jackman is rather unremarkable. It is not terrible, but there are no memorable tunes from the score. It feels like music I could hear in any other big budget film.With such a big budget, interesting ideas and a star-studded cast, this should have been two hours of Christmas bliss. Instead, Red One takes the joy right out of the holiday. I cannot remember the last time I watched a movie in theaters with such a stone-faced reaction, but this made for one of the least enjoyable theater experiences I have ever had. I wanted to like this movie or at least say more positive things about it even if it was not my first choice to watch, but I cannot bring myself like it. I enjoyed Director Jake Kasdan's two Jumanji movies a lot so I have no idea what happened here. I would not even recommend it as background noise because I can think of so many movies that would be better to have on in the background than this. This is the kind of movie that would make any fan of Christmas say bah humbug!",

It all starts on Christmas Eve when Santa Clause (J. K. Simmons) is kidnapped from his North Pole home. It's retirement time for his head of security \"Cal\" (Johnson) so he's not best pleased after hundreds of years - and working with \"Zoe\" (Lucy Lui) he has to find out just how his boss's security was compromised in the first place - and then get to the rescuing bit. That search leads them to tech whizz \"Jack\" (Chris Evans) but he hadn't any idea whom his client actually was. After a rocky start, the two men must pull their resources and save Santa before Christmas really does start to deal with all of us on the naughty list. It's got bits of \"Elf\" in it, mingled with some \"Harry Potter\" elements and to be fair to all concerned, they all look like they are having some fun amidst a surfeit of CGI and very tightly choreographed action scenes that mix the modern and the mythological entertainingly enough. Simmons and Liu don't really feature so much and the moral of good vs evil isn't lost in the delivery but it isn't laboured either. Perhaps it's not a movie you will ever remember seeing, but as far as it goes it's a fun vehicle for it's stars to cheer us up as the festivities approach without too much sentiment or cheese.",

        "body":"When I first heard about this movie, I got excited and I thought this would be a fun action holiday movie that I can put on during the Christmas season. However, that initial excitement started to faded when I found out what the movie's budget was going to be and that this is one of the movies where The Rock was constantly missing days of shooting. Regardless of that, I gave the movie a watch today and while I can say that this is one of the better action blockbuster movies I've seen all year long, it is also one of the more generic action blockbuster movies that Hollywood loves putting out every single year.Positives for Red One (2024):\nThere is some fun to be had with a movie about two guys saving Santa Claus and Christmas from the big bad villain. I liked Chris Evans as the main hacker\/bounty hunter Jack O'Malley and while this is one the more stock characters that I've seen in a lot of other movies, he does a decent job here. There is some fun to be had seeing J. K. Simmons as Santa Claus and while I have my criticisms about his utilization, I still had fun with that side of the movie. For me, the best performance in this movie is easily Kiernan Shipka as she is having the time of her life as the main villain and she knows exactly what movie she is in and is holding nothing back. And finally, there are some fun action sequences involving Snowman and a talking Polar Bear that admittedly had me smiling throughout the movie.Mixed for Red One (2024):\nThe movie has the storyline with Chris Evans and the kid who is his son in the movie to where they have this difficult relationship with each other and they have to overcome it by the end of the movie. At the first, the kid was a little annoying, but he is thankfully not in the movie a lot, which also makes me question as to why they even bothered having this plotline in the movie to begin with.Negatives for Red One (2024):\nThis is yet again another one of these generic big budget action blockbuster movies where it feels like the producers are spending too much money on a move that didn't need to have this big of a budget. While I did have fun seeing J. K. Simmons as Santa Claus, he's barely in the movie. Lucy Liu is also in the movie and she feels so out of place in the movie and is only here to show up when the plot needs her the most. Then, you have The Rock and he is literally just The Rock in this movie just like he is in every other movie that I've seen him in. At this point in his career, The Rock needs to start taking roles that will actually allow him to act and not have him playing his wrestling persona, you know something that John Cena and Batista have successfully done in their careers. I didn't laugh or smile at any of the humor in the movie and it feels like the humor that you would see in an MCU movie. And finally, the movie's climax is the typical and generic final battle where the main characters are fighting a CGI monster.Overall, if you like these types of movies, then you're goin to have fun with Red One (2024). I did have some fun with the mvie, I also wished that this movie did something else aside of the generic stuff that I've seen done better in other movies.",

Father who is a thief both in digital as well analog world for the highest bidder and keeps his distance from his only son. The apple does not fall too far from the tree, and the boy is no role model either; quite the contrary.Things are not any better at the other end of the spectrum. Many of the Santa Claus' subordinates are both physically and verbally very aggressive. No happy little elves here, but a bunch of scary monsters.Product placement is blatant. While the message the movie attempts to convey is that one should not land on a naughty list, the outcome of not being on one is just having more material wealth.Moreover, the writing has no nice tones or shades, and mood swings are extreme. At one point, the movie looks like a happy PG rated film but suddenly violence is queued in. As if the PG-13 rating is merely a mathematical average, a result of two scripts being put together. One, that was a traditional, targeted for the entire family and the other, which aims solely for R rating.One has to ask: What does the headless horseman do in this movie? Better be just a leftover from otherwise scrubbed script, that was used to get some salary bonus (unlocked by over two hour runtime) and not an attempt to build yet another cinematic universe.And that is really the biggest problem. This movie is not really for anyone.For the youngest audience this is much too scary. Teenagers likely find the subject is just too pampered, hormones and testosterone are not exactly oozing in this one. Finally, mature audiences, just like the very young ones, cover their eyes with hands. Not because this would be a horror movie, but because of the shame. Even if one leaves before the credits are rolled in, the fee was paid, and ultimately it financed an entity, that does not exactly make the world a better place (at least based on this release).True popcorn entertainment might not receive very high ratings on an absolute scale, but does not truly leave one unsatisfied.This movie, however, provides no value other than making many of the existing Christmas themed, done nothing but paycheck in mind, movies look like masterpieces.",

While the language may occasionally be humorous, it does disturb the overall enjoyment for Christian viewers. The film's production values are exceptional, with seamless filming, captivating characters, memorable music, and impressive special effects.

I generally don't like movies that CGI everything but this one I can give a pass to, I think mostly because it doesn't try to give you the feel that things are real and passing them off as real. I mean the entire concept of Santa exists helps with that. The writing was solid and at times which was nice because sometimes movies like this lack writing at all. It is not a laugh out loud movie at all but it had plenty of humorous moments to keep the movie going.

It's so bad I'm actually offended someone made this movie and thought people would enjoy it.The movie's biggest issue lies in its tonal confusion. It doesn't quite commit to being a festive family film, nor does it work as a gripping action flick. Instead, Red One awkwardly swings between genres, creating a story that's hard to invest in and frustrating to watch. While a Christmas action movie sounds fun in theory, this one lacks both the charm and the adrenaline needed to pull it off. It's almost like a 5 year old wrote the script.The Rock was actually insane to think making this movie would be a good idea. The biggest disappointment however was Chris Evans's performance. Whatever happened to him lately? He used to be charismatic, but it feels like he's lost his charm and doesn't bring the same energy that made his previous performances memorable.This film sure is another flop in his resume.The action sequences are equally uninspired, often feeling generic and poorly choreographed. The stunts lack the precision and excitement that could have made this a memorable holiday action film. Combined with a bland storyline, Red One feels like a missed opportunity.In the end, Red One is a disappointing addition to holiday movies, neither funny nor exciting enough to justify its premise. For fans of holiday classics or action-packed thrillers, this movie is best left unwatched.",

        "body":"I was unsure what to expect from \"Red One\" because I was lukewarm about its trailers. The film's budget of $250M also confuses me. I hope I'm wrong, but it may flop because it's opening a week before the next Barbenheimer - \"Wicked\" and \"Gladiator II\" - and to a potential $36M in the US. I still went in with an open mind, yet kept expectations as low as possible. After seeing it in IMAX, no less, my first time with the format, I'm happy to say it was better than I thought it would be.To begin the positives, Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans did surprisingly well as mismatched-buddy duo Callum Drift and Jack O'Malley, as the former ELF must team up with the latter tracker to rescue Santa Claus. I may never forgive The Final Boss for what he did to Cody Rhodes - the heel turn that single-handedly got me hooked on WWE, congrats - but I am still down for a Johnson vehicle, and this is no different. Post-Captain America Evans was likewise entertaining playing O'Malley.The legendary J. K. Simmons puts in an enjoyable performance as Santa Claus himself. Even though he is severely underutilized, whenever he is on screen, I can't help but feel the Christmas spirit, which I wasn't anticipating from this film at all.Many scenes showcased creative concepts regarding the typical Santa Claus lore, such as changing the size of toy cars into actual ones and portals in toy stores that lead to different locations. They may be conveniences on the surface, but I felt they were welcome inclusions.The film was much funnier than I envisioned. Many jokes landed for me, whether simple exchanges or laugh-out-loud gags. One involving O'Malley had me in stitches, and I want you to experience it for yourself.The remaining positives include the visuals, the well-crafted action, and the ending sequence, which I felt was the best part of the movie, not to discredit the rest of the experience.While it was a fun ride, there are flaws I want to overlook, but I unfortunately can't. My main issue with this film is its villain, Gryla, played by Kiernan Shipka. She felt generic and wasn't that menacing, with a weak reason to steal Santa Claus.Other than that, since I don't want to over-critique this film, there were some tedious scenes. Luckily, the film immediately or shortly picks up, but I wish the movie had better pacing.Overall, \"Red One\" was a hard film to love but wildly enjoyable. Considering I doubted this movie, I was unprepared for how much fun I would have. It would be a shame if this film flopped, so this is my call to action for you to watch it in theaters.Technically, it's a bit of a mess. The performances, visuals, and humor aside, the story is not the most compelling since it contains a weak villain and some equally weak character decisions. Additionally, a few moments were unintentionally hilarious, in a not-good way. However, it doesn't matter what I think. You don't go into a movie starring The Rock expecting a masterpiece. A technical score of 5\/10 shouldn't matter.The enjoyment score, on the other hand, is what you're reading this for. It's barrels of enjoyment, with great chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans, intriguing concepts, exciting action, and desirable humor. I can't overlook the flaws as much as I tried, but the enjoyment score remains a 7\/10. It's PG-13 Christmas fun for the whole family!",

It offers a fun, lighthearted Christmas experience, but with just enough depth to keep things interesting for the adults too.The movie has a great vibe for kids, while still managing to sneak in a few clever moments for the grown-ups. So, if you're looking for a family-friendly holiday flick, this is definitely a good pick.

        "body":"LIKES:Funny BanterMoving PaceLittle References to Other Holiday MoviesFun Mythological worksDecent ActingCreativeThe KrampusSurprisingly Heart FeltSUMMARY:\nThe movie is a buddy comedy wrapped in a Christmas package and loaded with some fun and funny moments to start the season on the right foot. Evans and Johnson have great banter work in this film, trading metaphorical blows as they each try to work together to take point in the mission. A dry security expert and a lackadaisical hacker are two very different personalities that work well to give the buddy humor, and I liked the twist they brought to the holidays with it. I found myself laughing several times at the lines, clever puns, witty insults, and some well-timed deliveries all assisted with increasing the comedy. Even more impressive, the movie manages to pull in comedy for all ages, though a caution as there are some very adult references that your kids might imitate. Outside of the fun, the movie moves at an engaging pace, chewing through the two hours without difficulty as they try to investigate the depth of Santa's conspiracy. Red One manages to integrate mythology and modern times into a Percy Jackson adventure full of clever references and ingrained lore that surprisingly fit better than they should. I particularly enjoyed how the movie also seemed to patch together several references to previous Christmas movies into one film; each component hybridized into a recognizable homage that still had its unique traits. The whole film is quite creative and makes for entertaining, popcorn-munching quality that still is surprisingly heartfelt with the messages at hand. Yes, it gets a tad cheesy, but I have to say that Red One managed to modernize the message about Christmas and add just that new-age mentality without falling into the modern-day agenda other films have found.As a section on itself, I give props to the acting in this film and the commitment they made to a very odd movie like Red One. Johnson is the same man he often is, in this case, the stoic, no-nonsense, brute-force hero with the mission in mind and nothing more. He plays the rugged \"action\" role well and does little to escape from the stereotype he has placed himself in. Evans also plays his typical range, this one more of that haphazard and aloof demeanor with only sarcasm and rogue fun to break through the façade. He will, of course, have some changes in the movie, but it's nothing new and perfect for the broad audience the movie is trying to appeal to for these primary ratings. Liu sort of falls back to her 90s roles again, never extending past her intense stares and very monotone emotion, which again fits the bill for the head of a government organization. She has a few moments to break through the hard-as-stone persona, but otherwise, you get another personality that meshes well with the energy of the movie. The Krampus, however, is probably the most unique and dynamic of the characters in this film. Kristofer Hivju brings fantastic energy with his vocal and non-vocal acting as the big baddie of Christmas. His delivery is top-shelf quality, owning the moment with how he embraces the darker emotions that come with the holidays. His costume and makeup work is some of the best of the bunch, with the group putting a lot of time and energy into crafting realistic costumes that I like in my movies and not compromising on the complexity of the character. I would have liked a lot more of this type of character, range, and creativity in other characters, but I at least got this gold nugget (alongside Simmons' take on the Big Man himself).DISLIKES:Action Is Dialed BackThe Comedy Is A Little FlatCharacter Usage Is UnevenYou've Seen A Lot In The TrailersNeeded A Little More ExcitementSome Story Components Could Use Touching UpVisuals Are InconsistentSummary:\nRed One's campiness is certainly fun and a fresher take on the Christmas holiday stories, but it still has some workshopping to help get the movie to the full spectacle they were trying to achieve. Despite the trailer promises, the movie is not the Die Hard of the new era. Many of the stunts are CGI runs, simplified punches, dives, and choreography that is very stiff and practiced with limited opposition that wasn't drowned out in montages. I found it funny how kid-friendly the action was, while the language was certainly not scaled back for the potential young audience members. And like the action, the comedy sometimes becomes a tad flat and stale by about the middle of the film. Fortunately, some of the other characters do the lifting, but it only helps so much to break up the cringe-inducing jokes that come at times. The character usage is bad in this film. Most of the characters were reduced to cameos, simple appearances, and some minor actions\/moves that were fun but highly reduced from what I thought they were going to be in this film. Had they maybe integrated a few more characters and dove into their backstories or emotional depth, we might have gotten a movie that could help add more integration and stakes to the fight. Increase the action alongside the threat of the villain, and you could have further helped give this movie more vigor and excitement, I think they were going for in the design. I'm not saying I needed vicious dismemberment or gory messes, but the world of Santa Claus offers a lot of potential for unique fighting and solutions that I think just didn't have the same level of creativity. And finally, the visuals are indeed inconsistent, as other reviews have mentioned. Sometimes, the movie makes things in stunning detail, like the Krampus or Garcia the polar bear, that are realistic as they can be outside of really good costumes. At other times, the special effects are back to the 2000s level, with the fake animation showing some budget cuts that could have been better utilized. It's not the worst by far, but... it's annoying to see such inconsistencies when this was a movie with a lot of backing.The VERDICT:\nRed One has accomplished much in terms of being a new generational tradition in the holiday movie lineup. It's corny, campy, and overall fun, bringing a lot of comedic styles into the film and not apologizing for being the fast-paced festivity that it serves to be. A good leading cast helps to lift much of the writing, and the creativity is certainly something for the books and will touch a lot of hearts with the messages and references they make in this menagerie. True, the movie is not the action epic they promised, and the story needs more edge, time, and character balance to accomplish the lofty goals it south. Yet, the movie is still decent and fun enough to get out to the theater to see and enjoy the holiday spirit.My scores for Red One are:Holiday\/Mystery\/Action\/Satire\/Comedy\/Fantasy\/Adventure: 7.5-8.0\nMovie Overall 7.0.",

Movies like this are a rarity these days-a fun, self-aware story that's well-executed without taking itself too seriously. Think The Toxic Avenger or other classics that knew they were dumb fun and embraced it. That's Red One, and it absolutely works.What sets this movie apart is its solid storytelling. There are no plot holes that leave you scratching your head or logical inconsistencies that pull you out of the experience. Everything in Red One fits together in a way that makes sense for the world it creates. It's entertaining because it's well-written, even though it's a \"bad\" movie by traditional standards. That's the magic: it's a good bad movie, and it knows how to deliver on every level.This isn't just a movie for kids, either. It's got plenty for parents to enjoy, too, from clever humor to genuinely heartfelt moments. It tells a wholesome story without being preachy, making it a perfect family film that's actually enjoyable for everyone.It's frustrating to see some modern audiences trashing this movie. People seem to have forgotten what it means to just sit back and be entertained. Not every movie needs to be some deep, artistic exploration of the human condition. Sometimes, a film just needs to make you smile, and Red One nails that. Pure escapism.If you're tired of agenda-driven, over-serious films that forget to actually entertain, Red One is a breath of fresh air. It's unapologetically fun, smartly written, and a reminder of why we love movies in the first place.",

        "body":"RED ONE is not merely a bad movie-it's a warning sign for where we are as a society. Its commitment to a ridiculous premise and overblown execution isn't bold, isn't ironic. It's symptomatic of a culture that mistakes bombast for creativity and cynicism for charm.The film's lame attempt at parody feels less like a clever deconstruction and more like an excuse to churn out a corporate checklist disguised as a holiday spectacle. Borrowing liberally (and lazily) from every generic \"Save Xmas\" trope, it drenches the audience in saccharine sentimentality while simultaneously pandering to the notion that bigger, louder, and Rockier equates to better. The result is a garish, crass experience designed to appeal to viewers who demand nothing more from their entertainment than bright colors and inane one-liners.Even the attempts at unique characterization fail to elevate the movie. J. K. Simmons as a \"gym bro\" Santa feels less like a clever twist and more like an ill-advised pitch meeting gone awry. Lucy Liu's performance is wasted on a trope-riddled role, avec an awful wig, reminding us that even talented actors can't save a script devoid of originality. The motivations of the antagonist, Gryla, may aim for depth, but the narrative is so weighed down by its absurd premise that any potential nuance is flattened into trite moralizing.The world-building, which some may praise as inventive, is more accurately described as nonsensical filler. The militarized North Pole and pseudo-technological Santa operation are bloated, joyless pro-gun distractions. Any charm or whimsy is sacrificed on the altar of CGI spectacle and overcomplicated logistics.Perhaps most damning is the film's central message, which ostensibly espouses the idea that there's \"good in everyone.\" How original. But beneath its shiny, feel-good surface lies a disheartening undertone: the glorification of simplistic redemption arcs and facile moral equivalencies. It's a worldview that panders to audiences willing to overlook harmful complexities for the sake of shallow resolution, much like they might overlook the failings of a charismatic leader with dangerous authoritarian tendencies.In the end, RED ONE isn't just a movie; it's a cultural artifact of a society that values distraction over substance and spectacle over thought. It's the Xmas gift no one needed but everyone somehow deserves, a flashy reminder that the bar for entertainment (and democracy) has plummeted to a depressing low. Anyone who finds joy in this film might want to ask themselves why they're so comfortable with mediocrity, and what that says about the state of the world we're living in.",

And the delivery is one of the most cringe inducing scenes.A lot of random swearing. Very little Xmas mythos\/lore but when they try it just misses. Obvious it was chopped to bits with sporadic cuts and inconsistent placing of CGI characters and actors. I used to think Evan's was decent actor but the voice he's using is all over the place. Simmons is a very poorly crafted Santa, but even he's sleeping though it.I hate this movie. I hate how it made me feel while watching it. I hate how it's occupying space from another perfectly acceptable holiday movie. I hate continuing this awful movie machine of crap.There's no point in being original if you don't have heart.",

I was quite impressed with the special effects, I personally thought that side of this flick looked pretty neat.Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans are fun enough in this. Johnson is a bit more serious than usual and I liked that, while Evans' character ends up being the heart of the movie. J. K. Simmons, more than Johnson, plays against type, it's actually unnerving seeing him portray a true good guy - was almost waiting for him to shout down someone's neck, as per.Kiernan Shipka is decent, as is Kristofer Hivju - I rate their characters. Lucy Liu is underused, mind. Bonnie Hunt too, I guess. I can't really fault anyone from the cast though, they all do solid work. If I'm honest, I don't see this film having much of a lifespan in the old memory bank but, nevertheless, I'd still classify it as something worth viewing.",

        "body":"An intense and towering performance from Denzel Washington as one of cinema's best-acted action heroes is what makes THE EQUALIZER stand out from the crowd, although as a film it's also a very decent thriller. It's supposedly a big screen version of the '80s TV series with Edward Woodward, although think of it as your usual vigilante movie and you'll be closer.Let's be honest here: the plotting in THE EQUALIZER is nothing special, and the Russian mob make for clichéd villains. It's the execution where this film excels. It's not an action filled movie, but when the action hits it's hard and heavy, not shying away from crowd-pleasing violence meted out to the villains. The extended set-piece ending might be described as 'DIE HARD in B&Q' and loses the realism a little but, but until that point this is tough and gritty film-making.Aside from the excellent Washington, we get a fine bad guy performance from Martin Csokas, equally intense and the finest I've seen from him, and Chloe Grace Moretz is wisely kept off-screen for most of the running time, which I was fine with. The final shout-out goes to director Antoine Fuqua, whose effortless style makes this a graceful and thoroughly entertaining viewing experience.",

Both films at just over 2 hours is just way too long, especially in the simplistic singular plot or EQ1. However, that plot still worked, and mainly because of the entire casts especially Denzel Washington's performance(s). EQ2 certainly had better pacing and a more suspenseful plot - albeit predictable, however it had many plot issues and holes as well as some scenes that needed to be edited down. The new supporting cast was not as strong either. Which did I enjoy better? Probably EQ1 by a small margin, but they both got an 8\/10 from me, as they each had their merits and issues.

        "body":"Rooting for a badass hero with a kickass attitude has never been as satisfying as watching Denzel Washington dish out some brutal punishment. This is exactly what you get in The Equalizer, an action thriller based on the late 80's TV series of the same name, but amped up with ultra-violent realism.Reunited after their collaboration in Training Day, Washington (received his first Academy Award in a leading role) and director Antoine Fuqua are back in this simple yet deadly effective action film. Using a Mark Twain quote about people who find their true purpose late in life, Washington plays Robert McCall, a loner and tragic widower with a mysterious past. On the surface, he is an amiable home depot worker who keeps to himself, indulging in conversations only when spoken too, and slave to some sort of OCD while remaining invisible to people around him. After befriending a Russian teen escort called Alina, (Chloe Grace Moretz all grownup), and discovering she is the victim of sexual abuse, McCall's nice-guy demeanor melts away to expose an aura reverberating layers of darkening complexity. There's a tightly restrained compassion in McCall's eyes, fighting a father-figure compulsion to do what he must, while Alina's is a muted plea for deliverance. This scene takes place in a diner they frequent in Boston, and it's the first of two powerful moments in the film. What follows is the film's first action sequence in a Tarantino-styled dialogue first, and blood splatter later, McCall dispatches Alina's Russian pimp and his goons. When news reaches Moscow, mob kingpin Pushkin sends Teddy (Marton Csokas), to clean up the mess. Covered with satanic tattoos, Teddy is anything but the moniker he goes by and with half the Boston PD on his payroll, it's just a matter of when and where McCall is eliminated. Or so they think.Having previously scripted The Expendables 2, Richard Wenk's story here is nothing new when considering McCall's proverbial 'set of skills', a comparison if you must, to certain characters Liam Neeson has played. On the other hand, there is a mechanism in place, partly due to the aforementioned OCD, allowing McCall a brief study of the situation before striking with lethal accuracy. While that sounds like a knock-off version of combat tactics employed by Guy Ritchie's titular hero in Sherlock Homes (2009), the payoff is watching McCall take out bad guys with improvised weaponry. It gets a bit hokey towards the end, with McCall using all manner of booby traps to slice, dice and blow up Teddy's dumber-by-the-minute henchmen. Having said that, it is still rewarding to watch Washington demolish enemy after enemy and this is largely due to Csokas' terrific portrayal of Teddy's loathsome nature. To that effect, the best scenes in the film are when Teddy and McCall are face-to-face and denting each other's armour with nothing but well written dialogues. One such scene is a powerful dinner table battering-of-wits, a taut reimagining of that iconic scene in Heat (1995).While humour and drama throw some light on Boston's mob controlled dirty cops, McCall's relationships with his colleagues, and even a short segment that suggests his origins as a trained killer, The Equalizer really shines with Fuqua's deft handling of action scenes. But topping it off is Washington in a vigilante role that is the best we've seen in years. Fans of Man on Fire (Washington opposite Dakota Fanning) and Léon: The Professional (Jean Reno opposite Natalie Portman), both films about male heroism influenced by female protégés, are in for a visual treat. Heck, who needs improbable superheroes when you have an average Joe with extraordinary capabilities and all without hiding behind a mask or costume? Although compelled to use the N-word, I'll just say – Ma man Denzel. . .doesn't disappoint and neither does The Equalizer.",

Today I apologise, because this is a fantastic film and I really enjoyed it.What struck me straight away was that first 20 mins or so. I'm sold. It tells us the characters you can see where it's heading and it fished me in quickly. From then on it was just an insane and tense ride. What was great was that every scene had a purpose, there was no messing about, no filler scenes with no point. Everything meant something and that's a rarity in this day and age. The suspense by the way, wow. Had me on strings the entire time, never knew which was it was heading.I really enjoyed the characters as well. Denzel wasn't just this stereotypical action guy that went round shooting people. There was so more more to him, more complexity if you will and with that there was more to delve into. You definitely get a John Wick vibe to this movie and with the main character, so if you like that. You'll like this.Just a quick mention, I would have liked to have seen Elena\/Teri more, I felt she had a lot of depth that could have been explored. I think my only I guess negative was that the villains \"evilness\" wasn't explained. Or explained well. Not sure if I missed it, but I didn't truly get why he was so \"evil\".But yeah, overall I really enjoyed my time watching this and I'll be jumping on the Equaliser 2 asap.

The movie didn't remind me much at all of the old T.V. series of the same name. The film is much more reminiscent of some of the old brutally violent morality tales that Charles Broson use to do.

This movie is based off the television series called \"The Equalizer\". It is about an ex-CIA operative who uses his special skills to help ordinary people who have no other recourse. This movie version of The Equalizer is more reminiscent of Matt Damon's Jason Bourne, and it is this that sets this movie above your typical action flick. In fact, in Mr. Damon's own words, The Equalizer \"...reminded me of the Bourne Identity, in that both are sophisticated adult, thriller franchises where the protagonists are capable of high-action exploits, but aren't running around in spandex.\" Directed by the great Antoine Fuqua, the man who brought us Training Day, The Equalizer is a gritty and violent, suspenseful and superb action film. This movie is very character-driven, and Denzel Washington, who plays protagonist Robert McCall, gives another stellar performance. His character lives alone, keeps to himself, and seems to suffer from some form of OCD. Most importantly, McCall is not McClane! He is not a wise-cracking cop in the wrong place at the wrong time, but rather a quiet and complex character, whose sense of justice is awakened when a young girl is brutally beaten. This movie gives you everything you would want from an action film: guns, explosions and great effects. However, the violence and bloodshed in this movie are deserving of it's R- rating, and create this film's authentic feel. The excellent performances by the cast are also what raise this movie well above your ordinary action movie. Team Washington\/Fuqua gives us a darker hero for darker times, and one you will cheer on every step of the way!!!",

        "body":"The Equalizer is loosely based on an 80s television series with the same name. This reinvention in comparison aims to be darker and much violent, but the film's ambition is basically turning its star, Denzel Washington, into a grittier action hero. It somehow pays off when he starts killing bad guys in cold blood, and it's amazing how he could still carry the character's humanity along the way. The film troubles when it gets out of hand to its glorious vigilantism despite it takes place in a world seems apart from that context. If you tend to ignore the sentiments and shade of reality, you can still tell that it's a pretty entertaining piece of action, but in general it's just difficult to not notice its mess of tones, even with that amount of fun.There is one side in the film when it's totally gripping, that is when we just see the protagonist as a person living in an ordinary life, often being with people and often encountering them getting in trouble by crime. This grounded world just keeps most of its darkness in their presence, sometimes feeling like a doomed, helpless world. But once the hero reveals what he truly is capable of, it doesn't actually sucks out its entertainment quality, but it does betrays that intriguing context, nearly turning itself into a superhero movie, except of course, it's less silly and much violent. McCall, in shorthand, is too competent for any criminal he fights and often leaves with a perfect swagger. It may not be big deal to many viewers, especially the action fans who are already enjoying the blood, but the film sets up an existing theme that seems to be a lot interesting to consider instead of indulging itself with its own way of justice.The cool slow-mos and stylish special effects might have also rob the sense of realistic tension, but put that aside, each action scene is watchable enough, we don't usually see a wider blockbuster today that has the guts to fearlessly show brutal movie violence like this. This is probably the only mundane element existing in those set pieces. Denzel Washington shifts his character to two personalities: one is the likable ordinary man himself and the anti-hero with a hidden cosmic hate through its world. The performance does sum up the overall movie, from gravitas to smugness, and what's great is they're both effective anyway. However, the villains (and their tattoos) have blatantly shown that they're evil: the main antagonist seems like he's written to be over-the-top, almost like a cartoon villain than a believable human mafioso, but Marton Csokas gives a little grimness as he have fun with it.The Equalizer would have been nicer if it was a little shorter and much consistent, but I could guarantee that it still entertains, it does have the appeal through its action and acting. Though, there are more serious things that could have made it a lot compelling thriller. The film does have the knack of embracing either of its elements, but it just keeps shifting back and forth, like we're not getting to the actual big picture. Well, if you can accept that the hero is this superior then it might work better for the experience. For now, it can be endlessly watchable, but you will only find few things that are remarkable about it.",

        "body":"Antoine Fuqua's big screen adaptation of the 80′s TV series The Equalizer opens with an impressive tracking shot through an open window, and into the orderly and near empty apartment, belonging to Robert McCall (Denzel Washington). McCall lives a Spartan existence; for the first twenty minutes of the picture, he hardly says a word. Fuqua (Training Day) gives a lengthy shot as you watch McCall fold something delicately into a napkin. When you see him unfold the napkin at his regular diner, and place the teabag into a cup of hot water, you understand immediately that this man is a creature of habit, firmly set in his ways. Every night he's there, reading a book. He's such a regular, that he strikes up a familiar acquaintance in a young teenage prostitute, Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz)), which eventually grows into something of a friendship. There is something undeniably hidden within him, however. When he realizes the danger Teri is in thanks to her nefarious Russian pimps, he forgoes his cautious life, and willingly brings on the pain.Director Fuqua accordingly really brings on the style for these sequences. His relative quiet touches give way to mayhem. Before every murder McCall commits, the camera slows down, taking on a golden hue, and you literally see McCall breaking down every element of his victims: tattoos, facial expressions. And then he lets loose: even timing himself to see if he can voice dispatch Mafiosi in 30 seconds or less.And The Equalizer is undeniably fun. It's one of those thrillers that begins moody and atmospheric, and then decides it would be more fun to see how many people can be dispatched with nail guns or corkscrew openers; and it is similarly unconcerned with logic in the idea that McCall decides to take down the entire East Coast hub of the Russian mafia, simply over one teenage prostitute. But with Fuqua this stylistically assured, and Washington equally game, does it really matter?As Teri, Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick Ass, Carrie) forgoes the sarcastic strategy Jodie Foster used as a teenage hooker in Scorsese's Taxi Driver. Teri is arguably much more frightened of her violent handlers, and is less given to false bravado as result. And even though her character really amounts to little more than a glorified supporting part after she is sent away, she is a great deal of fun to watch, and she holds her own more than capably against Denzel Washington (The Book Of Eli). The habit of extended cameos in The Equalizer is even more extreme in the case of Melissa Leo as Robert's former CIA contact, who pops up to give a vital piece of information on the evil mobster, and to tentatively tiptoe around the subject of his wife, while offering a small measure of comfort. The bit part parade reaches \"blink-and-you-miss him\" cameo status, by casting a reputable star like Bill Pullman as Leo's husband, and giving him no more than four lines (though of course it's possible that this may be a larger part that met with cuts in the editing room).If anything, a weakness of The Equalizer is that McCall's troubled personal life is left as somewhat ambiguous. Who can blame it really? The opening aims for a quiet kind of profundity, and it succeeds, but isn't really interested in following through. For all its thin characterization, there is something just as nice in watching Denzel Washington coldly and calculatingly firing a nail gun in righteous vengeance.See more at: www.mediumraretv.org",

        "body":"Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) has a mysterious past and is trying to live the quiet life working at a Boston home improvement box store. He helps his co-worker Ralphie lose weight to get the security guard job. He's friendly with street walker Teri\/Alina (Chloë Grace Moretz) whom he often meets as he reads at a local diner. She ends up in the hospital after getting severely beaten up by her pimp Slavi. He tries to buy her freedom but ends up killing everybody. Violent Russian gangsters come looking for payback.This starts well even with the cliché-filled script. Denzel can pull it off. Chloe is the innocent and he's the knight in shining armor. The problem starts when Chloe disappears after the first act. I expected her to be the second star and she deserves to be. She's good in this movie but it is strictly a solo act. The great brutal violence in Slavi's office is the highlight. The action slowly turns more and more cartoonish. Director Antoine Fuqua has made some great gritty action. I wish he brought a bit more 'Training Day'. Unfortunately, the last battle in the Home Mart reminds me too much of 'Home Alone'. There is something compelling about not showing what happened with the hammer. That's a great scene. It's a little more silly to see all the improvised traps in the store.",

It's an action packed, well paced, bloodthirsty two hour thrill ride.Denzel Washington nails it as McCall, it doesn't take long for him to establish as a character, we learn a lot about him very quickly. We know what he stands for, I was keen to learn why he does what he does, what motivates him.I really did rate Marton Csokas as Teddy, he is the stereotypical, cliché ridden villain, but he really did rise to the occasion, he's a bad guy you instantly dislike.Much better than the first, it holds up well, hard to believe it was released nine years ago, and whilst it is pretty violent in parts, the story is actually a very good one.8\/10.",

Every night, McCall goes to a diner to read a book and drink tea, and he befriends the teenager Russian prostitute Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz), the alias of Alina.One night, Alina's pimp Slavi (David Meunier) brutally beats her and she goes to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the local hospital. McCall goes to the Russian restaurant where Slavi is and offers US$ 9,800.00 for the freedom of Alina. However Slavi does not accept the offer and McCall kills him and his four bodyguards. The Russian mafia kingpin Vladimir Pushkin (Vladimir Kulich) sends the cruel enforcer Teddy (Marton Csokas) to find who killed his men. Soon he finds that McCall is the one who killed the mobster and Teddy begins a war against him. Who is the dangerous McCall?\"The Equalizer\" is a great action thriller directed by Antoine Fuqua. Denzel Washington is perfect, as usual, in the role of a vigilante that protects his friends against the Russian mobsters and corrupt police detectives. The movie is highly entertaining, with a great villain. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"O Protetor\" (\"The Protector\")",

Based on the TV show, Denzel Washington is yet another old man, similar to Pierce Bronson in the November Man, trying to prove he's still got it by playing a mysterious dude who works at a Megamart who decides to help a young hooker who got beat up pretty badly and ends up taking down some major hitters in the Russian Mafia, then becomes a target for the main boss.The movie had a quiet tone similar to Denzel and Director Antoine Fuqua's last flick, Training Day, but Denzel's performance in this is far more Oscar worthy. Denzel still brings passion to movies in an age were other actors like him are phoning it in just for the pay check, and basically that's what makes the movie. Watching Denzel on screen.In all fairness, The Equalizer's main antagonist, A man the mob sends to take care of their problems, was no slouch either. It was so entertaining watching these two hunt each other down.Possibly the worse part of the movie was there was not enough Chloë Grace Moretz whose role in the movie is no more than a gloried cameo.Overall Mr. Fuqua directed the great Denzel in another amazing role.",

There is drama in this too and it's still weird seeing Chloe Moritz in an adult role, but she's doing a good job with a small but important role.Denzels characters might channel a bit of Charles Bronson, but he's making it with his own unique charisma and flavor. One thing is for sure, if you have a Death Wish, just get on the bad side of him and you are on.

Denzel is one of the greatest actors in cinema history FACT & i grew up watching & loving this guy & over the years he's cranked out some Amazing films such as \"Training Day\" & \"Man on Fire\" & \"Deja Vu\" & \"The Taking of Pelham 123\" & \"The Bone Collector\" & many, many more films. I'm a fan of Denzel but some of his flicks i didn't like such as \"Inside Man\" & \"The Book of Eli\" (terrible ending) & \"2 Guns\" but most of his work is usually excellent with excellent performances.\nHere Denzel gives another incredible performance to his big list of great roles!!! McCall is a deadly man but a good man who will stop & help someone in trouble & here set in Boston he gets in deep trouble with the local scum, the Violent Russian gangsters who pimp out young girls & here \"McCall\" helps out a young brutalized girl \"Teri\" played greatly by Cloe Grace Moretz & comes head to head with a very dangerous man called \"Teddy\" played intensely by Martin Csokas, we also have a small role for the excellent Bill Pullman who turns up later in the film.\nDirector Antoine Fuqua has created a fantastic urban vigilante action Thriller that's exciting, gritty, brutal & fun.\nThe fact Robert McCall works a regular ordinary job in a hardware store is just genius & grounds everything is a sense of realism.\nMcCall goes about his violent business cleaning up a dark crime ridden Boston & meets good people as well as bad people.\nSome of my favourite moments are just of McCall sitting in the all night diner reading his book & drinking his tea, little scenes like that are just beautiful with the night time setting & the look of the city streets at night are all captured beautifully.The Action is brutally fun when McCall starts using his \"Special Skills\" on the local thugs & corrupted cops, it's a joy to watch him doing what we would all love to be done in real life!!!\nAnother excellent Denzel Washington film & role, this is probably my favourite Denzel film & role!!!",

Washington plays Robert McCall, a man with a dark past trying to eke out a quiet life until he feels compelled to help a young prostitute (Chloe Grace Moretz – truly horrible) who is beaten to a pulp by her Russian pimp. Trouble is this particular pimp is part of the Russian Mafia's American contingent, so a simple chat over coffee and cake won't do the trick. So after an excruciatingly slow opening 30 minutes, Washington is unleashed in a tense and ultimately bloody confrontation that results in the Russian mob sending over more minions (led by Marton Csokas' sinister sociopath) to be slaughtered in slow motion awesomeness. If the plot sounds a bit clichéd – hooker with a heart of gold, evil Ruskis, one last job, ridiculously inept and indispensable henchmen – that's because it is. Fuqua attempts to imbue his film with dramatic heft, yet he shouldn't have bothered. When delving into character motives, moral choices and grand, thought-provoking themes, the movie stutters and splutters; thankfully the numerous action sequences are of an extremely high calibre. The finale is especially epic, with Mauro Fiore's cinematography and Harry Gregson-Williams' score combining with Fuqua's flair behind the camera to dish out an appropriately hard core climax. More of a rainy-Sunday-arvo-on-the-couch type of film, but if you're a die-hard Denzel fan then you'll likely appreciate this on the big screen.",

        "body":"I guess this was exactly the kind of movie that it wanted to be: retired nice guy with amazing violence skills gets upset and starts killing people to satisfy his own sense of justice and self importance. Few people remember the Equalizer series, from 1985, starring Edward Woodward and even fewer would recognize similarities with this film, except the name. My guess is that Sony wanted this film to be a kind of pilot for a new TV series.What really *annoyed* me off was that everything was completely blown out of proportion. Denzel's character goes to help a girl (what else) and kills some Russian mobster in the most ridiculous way possible. But this was just an employee of a bigger mobster, so he sends an uber psychopath to solve the problem. And so this guy has to be killed, hostages enter the fray, captured in some Home Depot thingy, they play 15 minutes of Counter Strike inside, only with household appliances, and so on and so on. They replaced Woodward's brain with Washington's brawn and some ridiculous semblance of planning, since he always wears a stopwatch and measures time for some reason that is never explained.What can we learn from this film? First of all that if you are an ex-CIA killer you can just assume there is no justice in the world but your own. Also, the other people that could help, like the police, are just hired help for mobsters. And if you are a helpless normal citizen that has to work hard for the slightest pay raise, you will be beaten, sold as a slave, blackmailed when you make a little bit of money, perhaps by corrupt cops, and your only hope is some homicidal maniac who really enjoys killing people in creative ways after bullying them into taking the first shot (he calls this \"giving them a chance\").Bottom line: a cliché from top to bottom, this is like A History of Violence on steroids and making little to no sense. A feeler for a TV series that I hope will never be made, it just offends just about everything involved in the plot: the police, the Russian mobsters, any military organization that is not the CIA, democracy, the justice system in its entirety, laptop makers that are not Sony, Home Depot, Ernest Hemingway, Mexicans, fat people...

        "body":"Most of the reviews on here seemed pretty favorable to this movie, but there were only a handful of reviews out seeing that the movie hadn't been released yet, and there were a couple of reviews that made me a little weary. But my wife's favorite actor is Denzel Washington so I decided to take her to see it opening night.To my surprise, I found this to be one of my favorite movies of 2014. The characters do a great job drawing you into their world. The Russian gangsters are great and the main bad guy is awesome (you know, in an evil bad guy way). Of course Denzel is incredibly engaging, but even the other characters are well done and draw you into the world.From the trailer it looks perhaps a little hoaky with the whole girl asking about the book he is reading, and some of the dialogue from the trailer makes you think this movie will be cliché, but I found that they did a good job developing the characters and those scenes.If violence bothers you, don't go see this movie. But if you like a great, engaging action-drama movie and you want to see Denzel whip up on the Russian mafia, go see this!",

And OCD is not time dilation.I kept thinking of the tagline from the Taken movies: I have a very specific set of skills. If CIA agents were like this we wouldn't need the US Army.The plot is predictable.I thought McCall had a completely unexplained no-guns policy, despite the TV character's highly visible pistol, because he keeps ignoring guns in favor of cutting up his own hands, but at the end he shoots a whole bunch of people. And why do the bad guys fire silenced assault rifles without a target?",

I'm sentimental like that, I like the good guys to win and the bad guys to die painful deaths.The calmness of Denzel Washington is just the right style for his character in the movie (the eyes). Action scenes are pretty good(although not John Wick level) and the story seems well put together.By the way who cares if it isn't anything like the old series(who I as a 30 year old haven't even heard of) this film is supposed to based on, It's a good movie on its own doesn't need to be related to anything else.",

        "body":"Once again Denzel Washington is perfect , as usual, as the vigilante Robert McCall distributing justice expeditiously. This is an action drama of an merciless avenger with full of intrigue , action , tension , thrills , and violence . Previous spy Denzel is turned vigilante and taking the law into his own hands . Former Marine and Defense Intelligence Agency spy Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) lives in an apartment complex in urban Boston. He carries a serene and quiet life as an employee at a Boston hardware store . A man who believes he has put his mysterious past behind him cannot stand idly by when he meets a young girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) under the control of ultra-violent Russian gangsters. Instead, he comes out of his self-imposed retirement to save a young girl. McCall becomes the go-to man when the helpless require the kind of vendetta they would never find without his skills , and acting as judge , jury and executioner . He assists the distressed people with the help of his Secret Services friend , Susan Plummer (Melissa Leo) who delivers him information enough, and she's married to Brian Plummer (Bill Pullman) . When one of McCall's friend is kidnapped and another is found dead, he seeks for vendetta . What do you see when you look at me? There is no equal. There will be consequences. Don't Go To War With Him. What do you see when you look at me?This first outing in The Equalizer series contains suspense , noisy action-packed , gun-play and lots of violence . Denzel Washington with his usual stoic acting plays Robert McCall , a former special service commando who faked his own death in hopes of living out a quiet life , and finds his desire for justice reawakened after coming face-to-face with members of a ruthless Russian gang , as he displays amount of weapons in different locations , as he uses expeditive means meted out to the brutal enemies by killing cruelly nasties . This begins pretty well with interesting script by\nRichard Wenk based on the television series created by Michael Sloan and Richard Lindheim, in spite of the cliché-filled storyline , but Denzel delivers the goods and he can pull it off. The plotting in The Equalizer is nothing special , it's a competent flick , though not an action filled movie, but when the action and thriller hitting at whatever cost , it's strong and heavy , not shying away from crowd-pleasing violence . It's a revival\/prequel to the TV show from the 1980s, in which Edward Woodward would help simple people fight back against the big nasties in the world . It was a pleasantly attractive premise, and Washington, as always , convinces me as a two-fisted man who sets out for delivering retributive justice and relentless vengeance . Director Antoine Fuqua has made some great gritty , action-packed movies and in The Equalizer shows his portentous skills . Antoine Fuqua shoots with his usual love of violence , well-paced set pieces and intimate scenes as well . It's adequate and thrilling here, although his director of photography, Mauro Fiore chooses a rare color palette that suggests uses natural light , at times , adding some atmospheric rain scenes . Aside from the excellent Denzel Washington, we get fine good guys and bad guys performances from Marton Csokas , Chloë Grace Moretz , David Harbour , Haley Bennett , Bill Pullman , Vladimir Kulich , Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo . Followed by The Equalizer 2 (2018) with Denzel Washington, Pedro Pascal, Melissa Leo , Sakina Jaffrey, Kazy Tauginas , Jonathan Scarfe, among others.It displays an exciting and suspenseful musical score by composer Harry Gregson-Williams . Dark and mostly night photography by cameraman Mauro Fiore reflecting splendidly interiors and exteriors. Director Antoine Fuqua who frequently deals familiar conflicts set in N. Y , keeps the film slick and stokes up the race some , but this only accelerates the flick's deafening rush toward the top and ever over. Fuqua handles the explosive action and the psychological undercurrents with equal assurance . Antoine Fuqua has made a lot of succesful movies , such as : The Magnificent Seven , Olympus Has Fallen, The Equalizer , Equalizer 2 , Southpaw , King Arthur , Training Day , Shooter , Tears of the Sun , Bait , among others. Rating : 7\/10 . The yarn will appeal to Denzel Washington fans. Well worth watching .",

I guess the most plausible reason would be that being an official movie adaptation of a television series, the movie would have instant \"branding\" and make it easier to market than a movie with a more original plot line and characters. Anyway, the story and characters in this movie are for the most part nothing you haven't seen before either on television or in other movies. You'll be pretty much able to predict what happens before it actually does. On the other hand, these predictable elements are put forward in a professional manner. Washington does well playing someone with a dark past who is still good at his game, the action scenes are brutal and fairly exciting, and the movie as a whole looks very nice. So I'm giving this movie a cautionary recommendation. If you are looking for something new, look elsewhere. But if you don't mind seeing the same plot and characters all over again, you'll find this movie a well crafted retread.",

        "body":"It's hard to invent anything new in the genre of the action movies. The Equalizer is no exception. This time, we have Denzel Washington as a nice and hard-working employee of a big hardware store, who comes to a nearby diner at nights to read. But when a young Slavic hooker named Alina, who he occasionally talks to, gets into trouble, this old man, 'dedushka' as the Russian mobsters call him, decides to put some people-killing skills he tries so hard to forget about to work.The movies where a small and quiet man is revealed to be some sort of retired John Rambo who gets back to business for the sake of justice are always a guilty pleasure. You can predict almost all the plot turns, and it's not like it turns all that much, but still you end up rooting for the good guy, simply because all of us sometimes wish that such people really existed in this world. The whole idea of a one-man-army doing the impossible so that the weak and exploited of this world could finally have some peace in their lives will never die as long as we live in a society ridden with criminals and ruled by corruption.Too bad that a likable protagonist doesn't automatically make a movie excellent. And that is why the filmmakers use all the tricks up their sleeves to persuade us to turn off the brain and judge by emotions only. Cruel and dumb mobsters, poor young girls who need protection, ruthless boss villains who seem to have no single positive trait about them, and all that is financed with the Russian oil. Awesome sauce.I do admit, with the way my country behaves lately in terms of the international matters, the return of the old-school image of a Russian evil is very well timed. And i personally have nothing against it, after all, we do deserve to be treated as a threat. I just wish it was done in a fresher way. Denzel Washington is without a doubt a great action movie actor, but it looks like he'll hardly top what he did almost a decade ago in Training Day. Now that was really intense, there he really had to break a sweat to get the job done. On the other hand, in The Equalizer things simply happen the way he needs, so this action thriller inevitably loses the thrills it tried to hold. And while the villain guy was moderately believable as a worthy opponent, and the final scene in the hardware store was really impressive, those were probably the only things in which this movie actually tries to stand out.On the other hand, with a little imagination this average action movie may turn into a very dead on political satire. Evil Russians are exploiting and brutalizing a girl with a rather Ukrainian name 'Alina', and a black man with a profile resembling Barack Obama's and a last name 'Washington' that speaks for itself, manages to singlehandedly deal with all the bad guys and tops it with killing the mob kingpin, whose last name starts with 'Pu' and ends with 'in', in his Moscow mansion. Since we all know that the real mobsters prefer London to Moscow, it makes the allusion even clearer. And the fact that the movie was obviously filmed before the recent political turmoil makes it almost prophetic.But even if that interpretation is just a pipe dream, this movie is not that bad. Especially since for an eye candy it has Chloe-Grace Moretz who's obviously trying to do more various roles but still can't help ending up in the same cute, a little clumsy and somewhat childish image. Not that we don't love her for that, do we? ;)The bottom line is: if you want to see a decent action movie where the good guys win and the bad guys die, or if you like to find the hidden meaning where there probably is none - then The Equalizer's your game. But don't expect anything close to Training Day from it, this way you'll save yourself from unnecessarily high expectations and disappointment that usually follows.",

It's easy enough to argue that The Equalizer is a perfectly good action movie, but for the intelligent viewer, it is too hard to get completely emerged in because there are too many distractions.The script has a disjointed feel to it and it leaves its hero under underdeveloped. It's always nice to see Washington as a top tier bad ass, who is as untouchable as the younger Steven Seagal, but after fter one action scene you get the feeling that this movie is going to allow him to come away from every fight without even a scratch or a moment of hesitation. And then comes the ultimate action gimmick of all; a scene concludes with him walking away in slow motion from an explosion.The climax of the movie involves a one against ten face off in hardware megastore. Here we start to border on satire as Washington disposes of his enemies one at a time using the merchandise. these images will put a smile on your face, but they go on too long.The Equalizer, like Taken, is an action movie that doesn't rise above the sum of it's parts and leaves you a little dumbfounded about how seriously to take it.. There are dramatic undercurrents in they story that would have elevated the movie if director Antoine Fuqua has not chosen to abandon them.",

        "body":"Denzel Washington is one of my favourite actors of all time, if he's in a film that will one of the deciding factors to whether I go and see it or not. I think the Equalizer was made with this in mind, it is far from great, it feels lazy and lacks any real depth but they know that a film with Denzel as the lead will draw in the audiences.The script, pacing, storyline & character development all let this movie down in my opinion and when you add all of those to clichéd, predictable scenarios; it really doesn't make for a very good movie. The story is so over done that there is no way it can offer the viewer any surprises, we have seen this so many times before, from the plot to the characters to the scenarios, it all feels very repetitive. Denzel gives a good solid performance but he is hindered by the awful, basic, mind numbing script. He really wasn't given much to work with and the scenes where he was given large amounts of dialogue it just felt clichéd and predictable. I think it was trying to be one of those thinly plotted, action movies where you can switch your brain off and enjoy it for what it is. I think it does a good job at being this apart from one major fault: The pacing. The poor script and lack of depth to the plot make it drag somewhat. It is simply too long for what it is; with a run time of over 2 hours it really drags in the middle. The first 30-40 minutes are good and intriguing and the final 30 minutes offer good action and some good scenes, the middle 45-50 minutes simply doesn't have enough about it to keep your attention.The Equalizer isn't without its positives though; Denzel Washington shows us another great, convincing performance, he really is a joy to watch. He plays a very likable character with ease; you always feel like you can connect with him as an actor, that is probably one of his greatest traits. The film looks brilliant; the settings are all faultless and expose a real gritty, atmosphere. Some of the scenes are very well done; the scenes at the start and the end scene in particular are well made and tense. The cinematography was given a lot of attention, the action scenes are very immersing, different approaches are used with slow motion shots and great music.Overall, The Equalizer has plenty of issues but also has many things which I like. It is easy watching, but that is about all. It isn't going to be remembered as a classic and it certainly isn't one of Denzel Washington's better films but it is entertaining enough. Just don't expect too much.6\/10",

Good score and cinematography, great fight scenes (it doesn't hold back, at the same time it's not gratuitous), and the story although has a simple plot, did more world building than I thought. I enjoyed my time in this scary corrupt version of Boston.If you enjoy the show The Wire, and would enjoy a toned down less hyper version of the John Wick franchise, this movie is clean and handles the story intelligently. Denzel kills every line and steals every scene.My one gripe is the pacing kind of jumps around at the end of the second act before the climax.

        "body":"Washington plays McCall, a guy who works at a home improvement store. At night he goes to a diner and ritualistically drinks tea while reading a book. Also at the diner every night is a young Russian prostitute who waits there to be picked up by her rich clients. They occasionally chat about the books he's reading. His wife started a project to read a list of 100 books but she died before she could complete it. Now he's repeating the project. One night, the girl is bruised. They walk together and her pimp shows up and slaps her around some more. Another night the girl doesn't show up at the diner. McCall finds out she got a beating and is hospitalized. He goes to the hospital and talks to one of the girl's colleagues who tells him how the girls are treated and that they are risking their lives.McCall decides to visit the pimp and after a whole lot of nothing finally explodes and kills all the mobsters there, pretty much single-handedly, that is, often with just one hand. That gets the attention of the main Russian mobster who sends a cleaner named Teddy to take care of things. Teddy is well-mannered, well-dressed, soft-spoken but vicious. After much investigation he finds out that McCall was behind the killings and starts tracking him and even pays him a visit.McCall, still living his slow life, thinks about things, he visits a woman who's some higher up in government. She tells him it's OK if he does what he has to do. Now McCall decides to act. He goes after corrupt cops on the mobster's payroll, destroys their entire operation, and meets Terry leading to the eventual final confrontation in the dark and with water sprinklers on of course, when Teddy decides to take McCalls's coworkers hostage.I'm not familiar with the TV series but this movie is a fairly average and formulaic action movie. You have the reluctant hero with near superpowers, who is forced to make justice when put in a corner. Personally, I don't think Washington makes that convincing of an action hero. He's empathetic enough so I see him taking on the standard Morgan Freeman role at some point. The story is very good though, even though things go pretty much as expected. The movie is about 30-40 minutes too long. For a movie that focuses so much on its lead, we learn next to nothing about McCall. And as much as this director, and others, do their best to glorify Washington--one just has to count the number of slow-motion shots of Washington--it's Marton Csokas who steals the show as the calm and brutal Teddy. The movie also ends on a laughable and improbable situation as McCall travels to Moscow. But I'm in favor of movies who advocate the reading of books, so I'll give it one more point for that.",

        "body":"A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story\/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ...",

        "body":"Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, \"we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it.\" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that.",

A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen.

        "body":"I will keep this short for the sake of not spoiling anything.Right off i should say I love Nolan. I adore most of his movies, and Interstellar is no exception. It is a marvelous piece of work whose visuals will be hard to forget. His shots of space and the way he played with colors is rather masterful. Maybe i expected it to be greater than what i saw, but even though i was moved by the movie i did not quite feel like he created something great with 'Interstellar.' This could be attributed maybe to his overuse of sentimentalism in the father-daughter relationship he creates. Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans's score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey's acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan's characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast. The little girl was marvelous though. I do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever, but i have to say, it is one of the most original scripts i've ever seen. Ultimately this movie is entertaining. There is no way Nolan can miss that. Another great thing that Nolan excels at is INSPIRING. By the time the credits rolled and people walked out, I sat there still in awe at the strong sense of human will the movie conveys. Personally, I don't think this is Nolan's best. I believe Memento stands as his masterpiece. But with Nolan, everyone has their own favorite movie. Maybe for some, Interstellar will be their favorite movie, for it is really Nolan's most ambitious and visually-striking work. By the way, Anyone else who even tries to compare Interstellar to \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" is out of their mind. Kubrick's mission was to create art. Nolan in \"Interstellar\" sets to awe and inspire its audiences. It is truly a great piece of work.",

        "body":"It's difficult to put into words how powerful this film is. In fact, I'd go as far to say as this is so much more than just a film. After watching this, you somehow feel as if you've experienced a whole lifetime in a mere 3 hours. There isn't a single moment that goes unwasted; everything is purposeful.This is a sci-fi film in which the 'fi' part enables the film to convery so many powerful messages. It puts just the right amout of focus on science without trying too hard to explain or prove itself. To me, one of the most powerful effects this film has left me with is the concept of impermanence. Our time on this world is finite and we should cherish and embrace it as much as we can. The film also fiddles with the concept of time and uses it as an integral part of the plot. But perhaps the most powerful message of this film is of the human condition. Yes, as humans we have our shortcomings. But we can also show remarkable empathy, dedication and ingenuity.I would be lying if I said I wasn't highly emotional while watching this film. In fact, I found myself breaking into tears several times throughout the film. I know this review wasn't very analytical - I will say the following though: this film is so immersive and well done that you forget you're watching a film. The acting is simply superb and believable at all times. Reviewing this without talking about the audio and the music would be a great disservice. The film is accompanied by one of the most brilliant soundtracks. From a composition perspective, it might seem that there isn't a lot going on in the music. But the power of the soundtrack is in its simplicity and the emotions it manages to evoke.I will end this review by saying that I truly think this film has made me a better person in some sense. It reminded me of how powerful humans can be, and how we should use our finite time on this planet to care and be empathic towards each other and our planet.",

        "body":"I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.And this is IT!When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years).Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him \"X\". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.And finally, the scenario\/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly \"X\", will managed to convince you about that.My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say \"we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick\" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought.",

        "body":"The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar. Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded. I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves \"behind\" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the \"black hole beyond the horizon\" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, \"all it takes is a little push ! \"*you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out.Félix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014",

        "body":"(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style)There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit.Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar.",

Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the \"fi\" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date.",

        "body":"This film tells the story of an ex-pilot in a world full of dust storms. He is chosen to travel to the uncharted parts of the space in search for a new habitable planet.\"Interstellar\" is a long film, and the first two hours of it does not seem like a typical Christopher Nolan film. Most of the scenes are (literally) down to Earth, with no fancy visual effects. It spends much time building up the story, telling the story of a father and his daughter who sees 'ghost' in her bedroom. Through this ghost, one thing led to another, and the man is in space. When the film is not down on Earth, it looks more like a disaster film. The first adventure is a spectacular feat involving water. It also introduces the physics of relativity, on how time slows down in another world, leading to a misguided decision of the astronauts in retrospect. This sets the foundation for future plot involving more relativity.As the film progresses, there is more adventure, both in the form of adrenaline pumping adventure and humanity and integrity testing conditions. Matt Damon's character forms a central subplot that makes me reflect on what lengths would people go in order to achieve a certain goal. It reflects on the reality that people are driven by egocentric instincts. It is not a pretty truth, but it tells that human are not idealistic creatures.The final half an hour is what a typical Christopher Nolan film is like. It makes me hold my breath because it is so intense, both emotionally and cognitively. The ending gives me inexplicable exhilaration. Things come to a full circle, and it is filled with joy.It is not a film for everyone, as the story is long and takes a lot of time to build. Two people walked out of the cinema an hour into the film, and someone sitting behind me remarked after the film ended that he opined it was the most boring Christopher Nolan film ever. For me, I enjoyed \"Interstellar\" thoroughly, because it is emotionally captivating and intellectually challenging.",

There are tons of people giving this movie 10\/10 ratings, leading to a user rating of 8.7, and it is now #29 on the IMDb top 250. WOW! That is a lot of praise! On the top 250, \"Interstellar\" is above \"Casablanca\", \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", \"Psycho\", \"Apocalypse Now\", and \"CITIZEN KANE\"! According to the users on IMDb, this movie's better than \"Citizen Kane\", which has been known as possibly the greatest film of all time!Is is better than \"Citizen Kane\"? No, not even close. The film is full of flaws, the biggest being the runtime. I may never see this movie again because of how long it felt! It feels like a lot of scenes are unneeded, and were made just so the movie could be longer, because Christopher Nolan wanted to make it seem really epic. I'm sure if Nolan cut a huge chunk of the movie out, it would've been better. A film by Nolan that is better than this one is \"The Dark Knight\", which has a somewhat long runtime, but it feels way shorter than it's runtime, and is extremely entertaining throughout. \"Interstellar\" is so long that it starts to really drag on and, at times, I began to just zone out.The film is also a bit too dramatic. The dialogue about how \"love conquers all\" seemed very unnecessarily corny, as well as a few other select scenes in the movie. However, some sequences were quite powerful, especially the ending, which, actually, was kind of creepy. The concept of time was very prominent throughout the film, and it lead to some pretty creative and powerful sequences.Overall, the film is recommended, but you should be warned that this movie was LOOOOOOOONG!!!!!!",

Maybe the director wanted the actors to act that way, but every time they did something amazing, they barely acted surprised. It was as if it was all in a days work. This is the sole reason why I can't get myself to re- watch this movie. The visuals were amazing, but I'm more interested in plot lines and character development than pretty effects (call me old school, even though I'm in my 20's). The movie tries to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but falls short. 2 months after watching Interstellar, not much is retained in my memory (I had to re-read the ridiculous plot and re-watch a trailer to bring my memory back). Whereas 2001 I watched 6 or so months ago and remember most of it. It may seem like I'm calling this movie terrible, it's not. It's just highly overrated and I need to point out the flaws that keep this from being a masterpiece. Maybe I've seen too many programs about space (Cosmos, The Universe, 2001, etc) that keep this movie from stunning me with the visuals, but if you're a person that has not seen too many space programs, you'd probably like it.

        "body":"Love is the one thing that transcends time and space... New creation of Christopher Nolan's genius, whose name is now known to everyone. His films are waiting with a special look, because it offers something that every day, unfortunately, less and less can be found in the world of mass cinema - an interesting spectacle, filled with meaning, ideas and emotions. At this time, Christopher decided to send us not to the world of dreams, and even not on the dark streets of Gotham City. No, now he send us to the journey to, and perhaps beyond the boundaries of the possible and impossible, through the curvature of space and time, in other worlds. And you won't forget this trip, this can be assured. I was madly waiting for Interstellar's release. And then, finally, I was able to see this Beauty - at the premiere in my coutry on October, 29. It was incredibly exciting. It was a delight. It was unforgettable. It was gorgeous. Nolan once again amazes the viewer's imagination by his painting. Journey to the brink of infinity, the line where humanity has never set, acts as either the first-born purpose and a background of emotional history about the father and the daughter. A loving father who mankind need to help, but that he should leave his children, and a loving daughter who doesn't want to let her dad in the infinity darkness. Starting from the very first frame and ending with the closing credits, a new picture of Nolan will absorb you completely, forcing stare at the screen during the whole action, because it's all so exciting and interesting that escape becomes physically impossible. No, this three hours won't fly quickly for you. You'll feel every emotion, every event, every character. You will not look how the main characters travel through the universe, because the movie experience in this film is so excellent that you will be on board of \"Endurance\" starship and travel between the worlds with the main characters by yourself.The emotional core of this story is the relationship of Matthew McConaughey's character and his daughter - Mackenzie Foy' and Jessica Chastain' character. And the acting work of these three artists in \"Interstellar\" impress the most. McConaughey was acting really great, and this is one of the most emotional, if not the most emotional role of his life. All the drama and tragedy of the relationship of father and daughter in this film will not leave anyone indifferent. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn and other actors also coped with their roles and presented the film's supporting characters very realistic. I would particularly like to note a small but important in this story role of Matt Damon, a character who has received quite memorable. If we talk about the characters, it should be noted also two robots that accompanied our heroes in this difficult journey. One of them adds a touch of humor in the film, which mitigates constantly depressing, dramatic, and sometimes really dark atmosphere.The script of the film is very well combined the history of space exploration and the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The story is complex and complicated, is based on real scientific theories by Kip Thorne, and indeed contains a reference to the \"Space Odyssey\" and other sci-fi pictures. This story about true love, about loyalty, forgiveness, fraud, hard decisions, and much more. And it is designed so that leaves a lot of room for the imagination of the viewer. It's also possible to notice some structure allusion to another Nolan's work - Inception. The story and visuals are combined just perfectly in Interstellar.Hans Zimmer's score, written by him on the basis of only one letter from Nolan, hold the key: \"Once we become parents, we can't help but look at ourselves through the eyes of our children\", deserves a special praise. On this basis, Hans managed to write just incredible soundtrack that perfectly harmonizes with the history and the visual side of the picture. And this work of the composer is really different from the previous ones. It is executed in a different style from another subject in its base. Very impressive work, which will be pleasantly listened again and separate from the film itself. Visual range of the picture is incredibly beautiful and circuses. The \"Endurance\" itself, new worlds, insanely beautiful and mysterious space, wormholes, black holes, and travel through them, folds of time and space are arranged so that is simply breathtaking. I would like to thank all those who contributed to the creation of a visual of this film. It must be seen. That mastery with which this is done, not just words. In the visual pattern also has some references to the Kubrick's \"Odyssey\", and they are pleasing to the eye.Many thanks to Christopher Nolan for having given us such an incredible movie, which once again proved to us that the cinema is Nolan's life. \"Interstellar\" is a film that wins the hearts of the audience not only with its sci-fi splendor, but also an emotional story that lies at its very heart. This film is not only about the discoveries, space exploration and the final frontier of mankind, but also about the relationship of father and daughter, who were in a difficult situation in life when one has to leave the other in the name of a goal that can not be underestimated. So, with what Nolan's genius unfolds before us this action is beyond praise. Combining the story, filled with not only real science fiction, but the true human values ​​and emotions, outstanding and very emotional performances, breathtaking visuals, epic and dramatic soundtrack, Christopher Nolan breathed the life into this film by his directing to create something truly masterpiece again. \"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night...

        "body":"So last night I got the chance to see the early screening of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. The film I've been waiting so much from the early days of the shooting. How did it fare? Here's my take:To avoid any tl;dr risk, let me get this straight from the very beginning, Interstellar is one goddamnedly good film, it gets you to the edge of your seat, it soars, it warps, it rips your brain senseless. It's that good.Interstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before.For seasoned filmgoers, there are many similar elements (although it's understandable) with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). In a sense that this is not a bang-bang-shoot-shoot-blow-em-up sci-fi, but more of a slow-burning, metaphysical sci-fi which gets you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time.Similarity with 2001 and Contact is never a bad thing, but it becomes a wee bit too predictable, although Nolan is a smart enough director in providing the final (a very sentimental one, I should say) twist in the story. The visuals in this film is majestic, everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level, Nolan-style. The space scenes are serenely suspenseful just like Cuaron's Gravity, but unlike the documentary feel of Gravity, there's a real gusto and pace to these scenes. You should also be prepared for the (for some, maybe) unexpected third act, it is Nolan's most sentimental and humane moment to date. And this is why Interstellar is more than just a science-fiction, it is a human drama intertwined in space and time loop.One thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte. The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated, visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released.After watching Interstellar, do yourself a favor and get lost in space and time and go back in time to see Contact (1997) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to further wonder and wander into the realms of the unknown.Because sometimes it is the unknown that fascinates us, frightens us and brings out the best in us.",

        "body":"The key of this movie may feel like you're watching only a Science-Fiction movie. Most of the times Sci-Fi movies are not great at telling an effective, emotional drama stories. You can't find this type of movie easily, unless you are watching a Sci-Fi movie directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Jonathan Nolan.Mixing those two genres is unique and dangerous. All the Nolan's projects are a bit dangerous and special.Not only the storyline is so great but also nearly all other technical details are great!Brilliant scores that composed by Hans Zimmer.The film editing is just beyond perfect. One of the best film editings of all time.The Cinematography by Wally Pfister is quite realistic and charming.The VFX are just stunning. Even the scientist are amazed by how great it is.Some of the people thinks this movie is based on wrong theories, so that makes it a bad movie. As you may know, all the movies are based on wrong things. You are watching a Sci-Fi movie. In being realistic, Sci-Fi movies are just one step ahead of Fantasy. Why would you look for reality in this movies? It's not a crime movie. If people would demand realistic movies, there would be a bigger Documentary sector.The main reason why people think like that is this movie is not only based on wrong theories. It's mixed. Some of the theories are proven, some of them has potential to be true, some of them are not likely true.But you can't make a movie that reflects so effective storyline with only the truth. Even \"Based on A True Story\" movies are so changed to make it more effective. You can't name any Sci-Fi movie that based on all true theories. Other Sci-Fi movies are not explaining the questions at all. And somehow when this movie tries to explain, this movie becames faulty. So better not trying to explain what's going on? In this movie there is no major flaw that you can't ignore. The main story is just so effective and perfect.",

Like his earlier movies, Christopher Nolan once again proved, how big a movie can be! There were some shots,which made audience go crazy..Some scenes were as epic as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Do not go into the theatre expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not for action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!! Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception, this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people who said Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months rating it 10\/10 in IMDb :D). I don't wanna spoil anything(If you want PM me). Also, make sure you go to the best theatre close to you. (If you loved Donnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is the one for you, Get ready to get mind blown!!) Interstellar Movie is EPIC in all sense!!",

It is slow, dark as a black hole, loud as an old Barton Theater Organ playing Fugue in D Minor interesting as a litter box. The story is thin.....I can't blame the actors, the entire plot is pretty simple. Can't inhabit earth, find somewhere else to live. Interstellar is a repeat of time continuum stories you have heard or seen before, I wont spoil it, but it's all been told before. Dialog is dreary, slow, ponderous. The comparison to 2001 is preposterous. The wonder and awe of 2001 and other movies before it was it had never been done it was the first. 2001 was all done without the advanced technology we have in computer imagery we have today. 2001 was a pioneering effort. This is not at all pioneering, inventive or surprising if you read science fiction at all. The imagery is not all that unique or impressive. The constant thumping and droning of background music was mind numbing. Most of the show I was trying to nod off, but for the LOUD THEATER ORGAN playing in the background I probably would have. I have to agree with some of the reviewers who thought the whole show was ridiculous and in some ways they are right. Somehow science has advanced enough to create interstellar space travel but not far enough to build power cells, clean power, they are still burning fossil fuels. The robots are Lego like, silly looking clunks of stainless steel....it is all so ridiculous. I would not call this HORRIBLE or AWFUL I have seen some real stinkers over the years. Interstellar is not so ridiculous it is a parody of a good movie it is just not a great movie some had hoped it to be.",

        "body":"OK, I'll keep this brief, but I'll also nail my credentials to the mast first. I know science, cosmology, sci-fi and film-making pretty well. I have, in the past taught film studies at degree level, and worked on the production of more than one major Hollywood sci-fi film. I read Stephen Baxter and I like space stuff a lot. More than a lot. And why am I telling you this? Because I should have loved \"Interstellar\", but I didn't for one simple reason: It is a truly dreadful piece of film-making.I won't even bother with dissecting the \"science\" in the film, because that isn't really the issue (it is wrong on pretty much every level). I'm not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix. And I'll ignore the sub-standard special effects - because FX don't a great movie make.The issues I have with Interstellar are essentially these: The film is an arse-numbing three hours long, and feels far longer. The pace is stunningly poorly judged - the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost.The characters are paper-thin, and I didn't care about any of them. The plot is entirely derivative (mostly of the vastly superior \"Contact\"). The special effects aren't special at all and the editing (or lack of) is so self-indulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity. The result is a plodding, flabby, and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact.I won't go on, but special mention must be made of the planets - Paddling World and Coldworld. You see virtually nothing of either, and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor CGI painfully inferior to \"A Perfect Storm\" and a location less dramatic than your own back garden.I've probably not been a brief as I intended, but as I write this I feel the disappointment and actual anger I felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again. It was a total let-down and a waste of more than three hours of my life. The gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd, and I am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me, or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by. I am fairly confident I didn't doze off, although I desperately wanted to.So in conclusion, \"Contact\" did all of this far, far better, fifteen years ago. In Contact the characters are human, believable, beautifully realised and you care what happens to them. The relationship between Father and Daughter is deeply moving and inspiring. But then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway, dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extra-terrestrial life, the science is accurate and entirely plausible (it was written by Carl Sagan after all), the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle, and it has something very profound to say.Contact is everything Interstellar is not, and it has a considerably shorter running time. Contact brought tears to my eyes, Interstellar bored me to tears.",

        "body":"Wowser! This Christopher Nolan film was presaged with such marketing hype that I went in with pretty low and cynical expectations. But I was frankly blown away with it.Just about everyone raves about Christopher Nolan's work, and you look back at his Filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume: from Memento via the (rather over-hyped imho) Dark Knight Batman series-reboot through to Inception, one of my favourite films of all time. For me, Interstellar is right up there with Inception for thought-provoking, visually spectacular and truly epic cinema.We start in familiar 'Day after Tomorrow\" territory, with mankind having in some way – not entirely explained – messed up the planet. As I understood it (and the film probably does require multiple watches with – see comments below – subtitles=on) the rather clever premise is that the world's food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive 'blight'. This delivers the double whammy of destroying mankind's provisions but also, by massive reproduction of the organism, progressively depleting the Earth's oxygen. For some reason – again, which I didn't get on first viewing – this is accompanied by massive dust storms. It is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid-West population first: starvation, lung disease or suffocation. Matthew McConnaughey plays the widowed Cooper, an ex-NASA drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by mission-leader Professor Brand (an excellent Michael Caine) to pilot a NASA mission. The goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect, through previous work, that a new home for mankind could be found.The first part of the film is set on and around Cooper's farm, setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film: that Cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father (John Lithgow, again superb) and young children Murph (aged 10) and Tom (aged 15) whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything, time-wise, for when he returns.Cooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including Brand's daughter played by a love-struck Anne Hathaway, who again shows she can act.To say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery. (However, I would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake Dr Mann (in a surprise cameo) is equally good looking! LOL).In terms of plus points, where do I start? The visuals are utterly stunning. Whilst reminiscent in places of Kubrick's \"stargate\" from 2001, the similarity is only passing. The film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder. Elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects: this might have just been me of course, but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous.Equally stunning is Hans Zimmer's score which is epic and (in places) very VERY loud. The film certainly doesn't \"go quietly into the night\"! When matching the noise of the score\/choir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is ear-bleedingly effective. This must be a strong contender for the soundtrack Oscar for 2014. One quibble, again 2001 related, is that Zimmer uses the last chord of Also Sprach Zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes Richard Strauss's estate receives some royalties! The acting is top notch: I've already mentioned Caine and Lithgow, but McConnaughey, Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are all great. A particular shout-out should go to Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph, who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role.Above all, Nolan's direction is exquisite. The film has a slow build on earth (which adds to the lengthy running time) but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly. And some of the editing cuts – again, Cooper's farm departure\/launch sequence overlay is a great example – are superb in building the mood and the tension.I've decided that I am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star film is a rarity indeed. Where I could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack, which was pretty inaudible in places: McConnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places. I look forward to the DVD subtitles. And one of the character's dying words – delivering a key plot point in the film – was completely lost to me (but thankfully later restated). Whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious, the end of the film, playing fast and loose with physics I fear, requires a gravity-defying suspension of belief (although I guess the same could equally be said of 2001: A Space Odyssey).However, the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours I will make a rare exception to my rating 'rule'. Overall, this is a top-notch Sci-Fi film. And a final word: PEOPLE THIS IS A MUST SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN!

That's why 2001: A Space Odyssey has no dialogue in its opening and closing twenty minutes. That's why R2D2 doesn't speak English.There's a scene in Interstellar in which Matthew McConaughey explains the origin of his daughter's name. To his daughter's face. This blunt method of explaining Murphy's Law to the audience is just one example of the unnecessary exposition which Interstellar's running time is so bloated by. It is also the first of many inferior echoes of Contact. In Contact, James Woods explains Occam's Razor in a similar fashion, however it is justified by the court of law context in which the scene takes place.More significantly however is the lifting of a major theme from Contact in which Jodie Foster never fully moves on from the loss of her father. Jessica Chastain's character here does likewise, only without the emotional resonance because she is so bitter that it's hard to sympathise with her. The other female character in 'Interstellar' (yeah there's only two) also spends all her screen time pining after a man. Feminists - stay away!Another silly moment is the shot for shot homage to Event Horizon. This is when one scientist explains to another scientist what a wormhole is. Which is like a driving instructor explaining to another driving instructor what biting point is. It wouldn't happen, like, ever. At least when Sam Neil gave the low down on wormholes in Event Horizon he was addressing blue collar workers so it was, once again, justified by context.Perhaps the goofiest thing in the whole film is TARS, a computer with delusions of being the next HAL 9000, which is actually nothing more than metallic origami. Have I mentioned it knows a joke? Yeah it has been programmed with one joke and it uses this joke many times. The joke is that humour is quantifiable by percentage.Why watch this when you can watch Contact, 2001: A Space Odyssey or Silent Running? Why go for Christopher Nolan's take on Dust Bowl migration when you can read John Steinbeck's instead?On a positive note there are some cool graphics to look at.

I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going.

Here you will see just people who behave most likely how the majority of us do. I would most likely do the same as the main character, which I definitely ain't going to say about 99% of other movies nowadays. It's probably a bit old-fashioned movie by the latest standards, but it's still how normal life is going on. I was pleased to see that movie and would recommend watching it if you like a good plot story. The actors' play is also quite solid as well, and there's not any bad personage even though it's a court-criminal story. Besides, what I also like about this movie, is it's not just the black and white story. It's a bit more complicated, but somehow everything is positive and nice in the movie.",

        "body":"I saw this film at the premier in the TCL Chinese theater as the closing film of the AFI Film Festival of 2024. Nicholas Hoult stars as the titular character who is forced into a moral dilemma when he is chosen to be on a jury for a murder. The story is kind of a twist on the old Henry Fonda role in \"12 Angry Men\" of which I can't say more without creating a spoiler. Hoult's performance is more than adequate along with the rest of the stellar cast including Toni Collete as the prosecutor who is running for District Attorney, JK Simmons as Hoult's ally on the jury, Gabriel Basso as the defendant, and many others. The story and screenplay are involving with a few surprises although the inevitable conclusion is not. Eastwood's direction is solid as usual but not exceptional; however, given the constraints of the story I would say that it is more than fine. So, in summary this film is a 7\/10, certainly not a 10\/10 but not a 4\/10 either (I reserve 4 and below ratings for films that are technically incompetent). Recommended if you can find it given Warner's lack of support for the film!",

Calling this effective would be a severe understatement, there's no easy way out here. A nailbiting and thoroughly engrossing examination of Eastwood's career-long infatuation with guilt, justice and the limitations of American law, turning the courtroom drama on its head with a fantastic script from Jonathan Abrams, the suspense is simply unbearable at points. Eastwood's taut and marvellous direction is here in spades, all backed by a very engrossing score by Mark Mancina, but it's truly the performances that had me teetering on the edge for the film's runtime. Nicholas Hoult never overplays the torment boiling beneath the surface, expressing internal panic to the viewer but not to the others around him. While Toni Collette and J. K. Simmons deliver equally fantastic performances, although, truthfully, I'm a little disheartened that Kiefer Sutherland's role was so limited. Like the gunslingers of his past, if Juror #2 ends up being Eastwood's final film (as horrible as that thought is) then the man has gone out in a triumphant blaze of glory.",

        "body":"I always love to see a thriller with a good hook in theatres and Juror #2 had me intrigued from the basic premise alone. Clint Eastwood may be inconsistent as a director but he's made so many certified classics that any movie he directs deserves at least some attention. With this being his supposedly final film I had to believe it was going to be something special and if this truly is it for him he definitely ended on a high note.The script does such a good job at putting you in the head space of this main character and it left me with conflicted feelings in all of the right ways. Nicholas Hoult is terrific in a role that would demand a lot of any actor and his few scenes with Zoe Deutch really endeared me to that character. I love a good courtroom drama and the film managed to be a very successful one by making good use of its hook to ring every bit of tension out of those scenes. I was constantly intrigued to see where things would end up and it left me with one of the best questions you can have after any movie and that is what would I do on the same situation?The script has a lot to say about the justice system and it's inherent flaws and I was very glad that the film didn't end on a stereotypically happy note but rather on a fairly bittersweet one which left as conflicted as everything else had up until then. The commentary isn't always as deep as it attempts to be however with a lot of observations that ended up feeling fairly surface level. A lot of that comes down to the supporting cast in particular the other jurors who all ended up feeling very one note with very little depth. They felt like conduits to deliver commentary rather than well rounded characters and their dialogue started to feel hokey to me very quickly.I also wish the overall technical craft was a little bit stronger. Eastwood is a legend for a reason but I just wish he did more interesting things behind the camera here. The way in which the central dilemma is revealed is fairly underwhelming and there were portions of the second act that began to drag for me because of how repetitive a lot of the courtroom scenes could be. But there's nothing about it that offended me, it's fantastically edited with a really good score but I just couldn't help but wonder what a director with a bit more of a distinctive visual style could've done with this material.Juror #2 was exactly what I wanted it to be and I think it's a travesty that Warner Bros doesn't have any interest in pushing it properly. It's constantly riveting and intriguing because it always made the most out of its premise. I wish the commentary was deeper and the technical craft were a bit stronger but it's nice to see a director of Eastwood's calibre go out on something as quiet and meditative as this. We don't get movie like this enough nowadays and it deserves so much better than how Warner Bros has treated it.",

        "body":"Say what you want about some of Clint Eastwood's recent output, the man delivers classic filmmaking and Juror #2 is no different. A cleanly shot and straight to the point courtroom drama about morals and justice, it feels like it could have been made anytime in the last seventy years.Nicholas Hoult plays Justin Kemp, a four years sober alcoholic who is summoned for jury duty. He'd rather be at home with his heavily pregnant wife but is happy to do his duty until a slight wrinkle emerges; a man is on trial for the murder of his girlfriend but Justin may well of killed her in a hit and run a year ago. Knowing the accused is innocent, but not fancying spending the rest of his own life in jail, he tries to convince his fellow jurors to return a not guilty verdict while not implicating himself in the death. A task made harder on both ends by Toni Collette's hotshot prosecutor, determined to land the conviction that will secure her the District Attorney position, and fellow juror JK Simmons, a retired detective who starts to do some digging.There are a couple of threads running through Juror #2. Has Collette's lawyer lost sight of justice in her quest for glory? Gabriel Basso's accused may be innocent of the murder but does he really deserve mercy? Really though, it's Justin's story and the movie is pinned on a fantastic central performance from Hoult who makes us really feel his dilemma. He is not a villain trying to get away with murder, rather an ordinary guy concealing the truth out of understandable self preservation. He genuinely spent the previous year thinking he hit a deer and his first inclination on learning the truth is to confess. He is talked out of this by his AA sponsor and lawyer Kiefer Sutherland who tells him circumstances (not least the fact he has a history of drink driving) mean he would be looking at a very long time in prison. Add in the fact his wife is stressed at being left alone due to her pregnancy being high risk and having previously lost twins and we can feel his tension emanating from the screen.While the central conceit and character are delivered expertly there are other parts of the film that feel much more slap dash. Some of the dialogue is tin eared (pretty much all the interactions between Hoult and wife Zoey Deutch are sickeningly saccharine) and some of the other jurors are outrageously thin caricatures. We've got black guy who runs a youth centre and has \"seen the damage gangs cause\", young stoner guy, true crime obsessed women and sage older lady amongst others. None of these characters are massively important but something a little less cardboard cut out would have been nice and when the weak characters and dialogue combine the film can stumble and on occasion become outright annoying.For the most part, the quality of the film making over rules the script's weaknesses and it's nice to see a glossy example of this increasingly rare genre on the big screen, even if the ending feels a little bit like the film is trying to have its cake and eat it. If this ends up being Clint's last film then it's a fitting conclusion to a career that has always been interested in justice and redemption. Then again, if he can release a film at 94 there's no reason he can't do it at 96.7 neck tattoos out of 10.",

This courtroom drama explores the complexities of jury deliberation in a murder trial that involves themes of domestic abuse. The story is immediately engaging, setting up a clear-cut case, but it soon dives deep into moral territory, where the right verdict is anything but straightforward.As a non-U. S. viewer, I found the trial process and jury dynamics especially fascinating. Eastwood cleverly exposes the issues of biased jurors and the impact of personal agendas. The film makes you question how often jurors-pressed by personal motivations outside the courtroom-lose sight of the real deliberation required to reach a just decision. This theme feels disturbingly relevant and is well-executed here.Though this is Eastwood's 45th directorial work, I'd say Juror #2 isn't his best. At times, it struggles with pacing, which occasionally dampens the tension that should be building. Still, the stellar performances from the cast and the moral questions it raises make it a thought-provoking watch, and it's a worthwhile addition to Eastwood's body of work.",

Sadly, though, they like the cut of his jib and selected he is. It's a murder trial with a man accused of brutally killing his girlfriend after a bar-room brawl. Prosecutor and aspiring DA candidate \"Faith\" (Toni Collette) thinks it's all in the bag, but defence attorney \"Resnick\" (Chris Messina) isn't so sure. As the proceedings commence, our second juror gets a bit of a shock. Some of this evidence is proving startlingly evocative. The more he hears of the incident, the more he begins to realise that his job as a juror might prove to be much more personal than he anticipated. With pressure from his wife and his fellow jurors to get it all over with, he has to fight to try and find a way to more fully explore the evidence and luckily he manages to convince one of their number \"Harold\" (J. K. Simmons) to help him. As the they dig deeper, what might they find and what might they incentivise the prosecutor to find too? I think Hoult holds this together well, and as the audience becomes better briefed on just who did what to whom, director Clint Eastwood still manages to keep the film engaging and tensely paced leaving the audience with quite a moral dilemma as truths start to out and sympathies become severely tested. Simmons supports well, as do Collette and Messina but Kiefer Sutherland appears too sparingly to make much impact on the story so it really is left to us and \"Juror #2\" to come to terms with what happened and with our own consciences.",

Known for his reserved, to-the-point directing style that always brings his features in on time and under budget, the nonagenarian filmmaker clearly has an eye for cinema and the desire to continue contributing to it. There's pretty much nobody more experienced in Hollywood, and he clearly loves making movies enough to do it every couple of years despite being well past the age most folks want to retire. All that is to say that if Eastwood is involved, it's unlikely a picture is going to disappoint (although not impossible, *cough* 'The 15:17 To Paris (2017)' *cough*).The best way I can describe the film, as well as most other Eastwood efforts, is solid. Someone on Letterboxd (I'm paraphrasing Matt Lynch, I think) said this could have been made at any point in the last 75 years, and that's pretty much on the money. Although it does attempt to say something about truth, justice and the American way (it can't be a modern Eastwood movie without some good ol' fashioned conservatism), it isn't particularly contemporary in its themes or aesthetic. That isn't a bad thing, though. It plays like a take on '12 Angry men (1957)' but focus the morality play more specifically onto one person, a recovering alcoholic who thinks he holds the key to a 'not guilty' verdict but can't come completely clean for reasons I won't spoil. There is some focus on a couple of secondary characters and the way in which they each have to decide if the truth is more important than their personal gain, but the narrative is anchored around the protagonist and we very much experience the story from his point of view. It's interesting to see him navigate his dilemma, and the flick does a good job of getting you to think about what you'd do in his situation. It does skip over some key internal development at a certain point in order to generate a sense of suspense in the build-up to a reveal, and I feel as though this does a slight disservice to the film as it prevents us from fully grasping why the lead does what he ultimately does. Still, most of the experience is engaging both intellectually and emotionally.The piece isn't massively affecting and it also isn't always the most compelling - or, perhaps, exciting - take on its genre, but there's a sense that it's close to the best version of itself possible and it's entertaining enough for what it is. The performances are all really good, the writing is relatively naturalistic, the cinematography is refined, and the direction is consistent. It's a solid movie, but it isn't really something you'd write home about. Then again, it's the sort of thing that will probably play differently for a certain generation. I could easily see it eventually being a sleeper hit on cable television for those who still consume their media that way. It's good, but not great. However, as I've said before, sometimes that's all you need. It's a nice Sunday afternoon movie.",

Now while I haven't watched all of his movie, I am well aware of who Clint Eastwood is and that is primarily because I have seen clips from his previous projects, mostly obviously his older western movies. The thing that drew my attention to this movie is that it was marketed as possibly being Clint Eastwood's final mvie as a director and if that is true, then this movie is a phenomenal way to go out for one of the best in the business.Positives for Juror #2 (2024):\nThis movie was a fascinating courtroom drama where it tells its story in a interesting way that rises the stakes for the plot and the characters. I enjoyed the cast of characters and there wasn't anyone who was annoying or boring, I found all of them to be related in their own ways. There are also some amazing performances with Nicholas Hoult as Justin Kemp, Zoey Deutch as Allison Crewson, Toni Collette as Faith Killebrew and Chris Messina as Eric Resnick. And finally, the movie is also a slow burn to where it takes the time to tell its story.Overall, Juror #2 (2024) is a spectacular courtroom drama and it is definitely among one of the best movies of 2024.",

        "body":"This was a solid drama that had me stuck to my seat throughout the film. It really pulls you in as an onlooker and makes you question how good the justice system is.As the film title suggests the film is about a jury deliberating the guilt of a man accused of murdering his partner.The judge says even though the justice system is flawed, it is the best we have and some commenters have said this film makes you question your morals. I disagree with that a lot. It did not make me question juror #2 morals, what it did do is make me question the American legal system. I've never liked the idea of 12 completely unqualified set of random people tasked with coming up with the verdict on cases but what the judge said was true. It is the best we have and even though highly flawed at times as shown in this film, I was wondering throughout if there is any way it could be done better. It cannot be up to just one person, ie a judge to make a final decision. But at the same time this film showed how some people might go in with an extremely strong bias as one juror highlighted, saying I don't need to see the evidence, I saw the tattoo on his neck so I know he is guilty.Again some reviewers said it made them question their moral values watching this film, if they were in the same situation, what would they do?I don't want to give too much away about the film - some people argued it is a moral dilemma between punishing someone else for a crime or accepting responsability for ones actions oneself.To me watching this film was far more complicated - because of how strict the American penal system is. In America even just manslaughter as the lawyer pointed out is an automatic 30 year prison term. So to me it was more a matter of throwing someone else under a bus in order to save ones own life. Literally that was the moral dilemma of the film and it made me question if the strict punishments in America are justified or even warranted. In my country the maximum term served would generally be 12 years. In this film, the maximum term is life with no parole.And there is little leeway on this punishment. As we see in this film, an accident occurs. That's what I would describe what happened. There was no malice, no intent, no chance of there being a threat of it happening again since it was a freak accident which can happen sometimes. Compared to what we often see in other films, serial killers - people you really would genuinely want to protect society from if they were caught.Yet in this film, it shows the law in America makes little distinction and someone who is caught up in an accident where they hardly had any blame if any gets exactly the same punishment as a mass murderer who has killed 50 people and would be a real threat and would deserve to get a sentence of life with no parole.That was the moral dilemma I was having a hard time swallowing. Knowing innocent people could be convincted based on a biased set of jurors which I have met plenty in my life - this film showed at the beginning how within a matter of minutes the jury was ready to convict someone to life in prison with no deliberation who could be completely innocent or the worst offender that should be locked up to keep society safe. It made me think the law should make these distinctions and not just hand out life imprisonments as the automatic baseline but weigh up how much of a threat to society an accused is, whether there was intent or whether it was an accident, whether there was remorse, a chance of reoffending. In America it is very much more black and white. Guilty or innocent. Life with no parole or being a free man. It obviously made me think as I think is obvious from my review. A really thought provoking drama from Clint Eastwood. Well acted and well worth a watch.",

For example, a sign is bright for an eye witness but later the same sign is covered in dirt and dark when part of a different scene. Just a subtle way to show eye witness testimony may not always be reliable.I agree with the reviews that the main character is far too calm throughout.

        "body":"The film attempts to do what many courtroom dramas strive for: a tense, gripping exploration of moral dilemmas, justice, and the human condition. Unfortunately, what it delivers is a bland, flat experience that feels more like a lifeless reenactment of the most uninteresting true crime podcast ever recorded.At the heart of the film is a classic setup-an ordinary person thrust into the intense moral conflict of jury duty, grappling with the weight of deciding someone's fate. This is a premise that could generate significant drama, yet Juror #2 squanders every opportunity to build any real tension. The movie is set almost entirely in the sterile confines of the jury room, where its characters-written with the nuance of a damp napkin-mumble their way through clichés and half-baked discussions.The characters themselves are paper-thin. The protagonist, played with all the emotion of a tax form, is burdened by a secret that could make or break the case. Yet, there's no real sense of urgency, no palpable conflict, just a series of dull exchanges that lack any sort of emotional depth or real stakes. The ensemble cast fares no better-each juror feels like a random character from an overly long crime procedural, each with a single, underdeveloped trait. There's no one here you can root for, fear, or even particularly care about.The courtroom scenes, or rather, the lack of them, are where Juror #2 falters most. For a film about justice, there's a shocking lack of drama in the proceedings. With minimal engagement from the actual trial, the movie resorts to recycling the same unexciting conversations among jurors in the jury room. There's nothing dynamic in the way it's filmed either-the direction is as lifeless as the dialogue. The stakes never escalate, the questions of guilt and innocence never feel pressing, and the entire narrative feels as though it's stuck in a never-ending loop of tedious deliberations.The film's attempt to dive into moral quandaries and personal secrets ultimately feels forced and hollow, like a true crime podcast that tries too hard to appear profound while failing to deliver any meaningful insight. Juror #2 lingers in the same uninspired space for its entire runtime, as if hoping that the mere concept of \"juror on trial\" will be enough to sustain the audience's attention. Unfortunately, it's not.In the end, Juror #2 is a forgettable, colorless courtroom drama that fails to generate any real intrigue or emotional investment. What should have been a tense, high-stakes exploration of justice and human nature is instead a sluggish exercise in monotony. It's a film that could have worked as a compelling short, but as a feature, it's a grueling test of patience.",

        "body":"Cinema's version of the Energizer Bunny, Clint Eastwood is still going strong.Warner Bros. Is releasing \"Juror #2\" in time for awards season with his Malpaso Productions logo at the beginning and his \"produced and directed by\" credit at the end.From \"Gran Turino\" to \"The Mule\" to \"Cry Macho,\" Clint has spent decades directing himself in what felt like farewell roles. \"Unforgiven,\" with its three Oscars including best picture, would have been a fitting swan song to a monumental career ... and that was a quarter-century and some 25 movies ago.In these unsettling times, it's reassuring to see that at 94 he's still at it. And has still got it.A poster boy for getting old right.Obviously \"Juror # 2\" is a courtroom drama but you're in a minefield of spoiler alerts trying to say much more about it.Nicholas Hoult has the title role in a cast co-starring Toni Collette with heavy hitters like J. K. Simmons and Kiefer Sutherland in the supporting ranks.Breaking the conventional wisdom of the genre, \"Juror #2\" doesn't hinge on a surprise revelation in the courtroom. We know from the outset that Justin Kemp (Hoult) knows more about the murder case on the docket than he lets on during jury selection questioning by D. A. Faith Killebrew (Collette) and Public Defender Eric Resnick (Chris Messina.)\nWhy does he keep quiet? We know the answer to that one, too.Guess it's not a spoiler if it's the first line in the trailer.Rather than craft a mystery, screenwriter Jonathan A. Abrams turns the formula inside out, creating more of a rumination on the difference between truth and justice, and the toll taken on people trying to sort them out. In this regard it's reminiscent of one of my favorite movies last awards season, \"Anatomy of a Fall.\"\nFrom the outset we know whodunnit. A more pertinent question is what does Guilty mean?While Hoult never quite finds the right right note in his character's moral ambiguity, the performances around him - especially Simmons' and Collette's - keep things compelling. It may not be a mystery, but the outcome is still in doubt right up to the perfect last shot before the cut to black.My personal history with Clint Eastwood goes back to 1983 when I covered him shooting, and starring in \"Sudden Impact\" in Santa Cruz. I shadowed him at a fish market on the Wharf, and in the neon light under the Big Dipper at the Boardwalk. I even got to be an extra in a night scene filmed at the old, pre-earthquake Cooper House, although my performance seems to have gotten lost in the cutting room.Considering that he was both directing and acting, the one thing he was was efficient. No more than two takes, if he could help it. If it was in focus, it was a go. No drama, except what wound up on the screen.Later, when I interviewed him at the Maui Film Festival in 2002, he summed up what he did simply, as telling stories. No frills, no preciousness, which belies the scope of his projects - from musicals and composing soundtracks (he also plays piano), to directing and co-starring with Meryl Streep in \"The Bridges of Madison County\" or shooting \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" in Japanese.\"Juror #2\" is closer to the \"Sudden Impact\" end of the spectrum: efficient, rather than flashy or artsy. It's a story told in close-ups, emotions played out in eyes and on faces rather than in words. It is, after all, a story based on what's not being said.It is a work of craftsmanship more than art, the creation of a master comfortable in the larger-than-life profession, a man in his prime for almost a century now.",

It's like a mystery that has been solved but how it ends is complexified and unstable. It works very well. The acting is convincing and natural from the entire cast, I'd surmise largely due to the experienced direction. What they are thinking is very effectively portrayed.

        "body":"With a few exceptions, all of Clint Eastwood's films seem to be about one single topic that he has been obsessing about for the past 30 years: justice. Juror #2 certainly goes back to this theme, more directly than ever. The question this time seems to be about the very definition of justice and whether the principle that justice has to be delivered on an individual case vs a broader context is right. In pure Eastwood fashion, the film doesn't provide a straight answer and instead lets us, members of the audience, reflect on it.While the film's topic is universal, Eastwood grounds it in a contemporary setting and contemporary values, reminding us that the only justice that matters is today's justice. I believe it's in that sense that the overt reference to Twelve Angry Men needs to be interpreted. Less as an homage, and more as an artifact to paint how the justice system and the concept of justice may have evolved since that iconic film. While the motions may look the same, the meaning to us now and the outcomes are very different.Without going deeper into the story or its meaning, suffice it to say that Juror #2 is deeply thought-provoking and engaging. Apparently Warner Bros. Wanted to release it only on its streaming platform because it \"looks like a tv show\". This is probably true and mainly means it is shot in a classical way (for example, without excessive camera movements and without cgi) and likely with a concern for cost. But how little do you need to care about film to think that's a bad thing or something that would preclude you from a theatrical release? I guess we have to be thankful they even produced the film at all, as one can appreciate the risk in producing a film by a 94 year old director. The film is outstanding, so thank you, Warner.",

These frivolities aside, the film revolves around the inner conflicts of a jury, but it has its own identity and style, and I must say that Clint Eastwood is still absolutely on form. Let's start with the cast: very well cast and composed of actors who are not top-notch, but really good. The story does not see the tension rise slowly, as in a Hitchcock film, but maintains its linearity. One has time to empathise and wonder what we would have done in certain situations. With a few more mischievous plot choices, we might have seen a stronger emotional drama, but that is Clint's style: there is no rollercoaster here, there is a depiction of what could happen in real life. To conclude: the film is worth seeing. It is not Eastwood's best, but it is not bad. And it might be his last film. Until the next one.",

        "body":"Clint Eastwood films are always films where you expect quality. The 94-year-old director obviously needs no introduction and one must respect that the very old Eastwood has not sat behind the geraniums. In the leading role we see Nicholas Hoult, who made a name for himself with films such as Mad Max: Fury Road, Warm Bodies and a number of X-Men films. We also see J. K. Simmons and there is a small role for Kiefer Sutherland. These types of courtroom films were made a lot in the past and there were a few very strong films among them. At first glance it also seems that Juror #2 could become such a strong film, because the story is interesting enough for it.And the film certainly is strong. Justin Kemp is called up to fulfill his jury duty and at first glance there seems to be little wrong. He would rather get out of it because his wife is heavily pregnant and could give birth at any moment. It seems like a done deal and the rest of the jury members don't feel like dragging the case out unnecessarily. As a viewer, you are shown what happened in the bar and at first glance it is quite confusing when we see that Justin was also in the bar that night. When Justin realizes this, he starts to feel guilty and is faced with a dilemma where he could acquit the suspect, but that does mean that Justin himself has a very big problem. When he tries to manipulate the case, it is another jury member named Harold who starts to dig deeper into the case.Up to that point, the film is really good and the plot has been well thought out, but unfortunately it goes wrong at the end. The denouement is too simple and it is unthinkable that this happens and the prosecutor does not realize what is really going on. There is still an attempt at the very end to link a thrilling denouement to it, but it is simply too simple, which makes the whole effect disappear and this could have been written by a small child. More attention should have been paid to it and the writer should have approached it more cleverly, only then the film could have joined the list of strong courtroom films. We are now left with a fine film, which unfortunately does not really convince anywhere and certainly for a director like Eastwood we would have expected a slightly smarter approach.Juror #2 starts as a very strong film, but the denouement ensures that the film does not convince. That is a great shame, because there could have been much more if the writer had handled the story a little smarter. Don't get me wrong, because Juror #2 is really worth watching and it will really keep you in its grip, but prepare yourself to be a little disappointed at the end. For the rest, the film is solid and what you may expect from a cast like this. In any case, this film will not be the surprise of the year, but all in all the film is certainly worth it.",

Good (and innocent) people getting dragged into the justice machine, and dealt a sausage factory form of justice.Where the film fell down was in feeding us cliche characterisations and plot details. The hard nosed layer, the overweight authoritarian court officer, the selfish juror etc etc. These were at odds with what Hoult's character was bringing to the table, and it could easily have been a more deep and meaningful journey if it dropped the tropes and found the humanity of the situation. Less \"I'm done here\" inmates knocking on the door to stop a conversation about his innocence and more real person reactions to these situations.I guess we kinda expected it from Eastwood who has spent his entire life giving us these types of characters and they've become the industry standard for cliche now although they weren't so much when he first bought the to the screen.How good would it have been if Eastwood had delivered a new batch of interesting characters to the screen on his swan song film.

In a case of murder, Justin believes there is a possibility he was the one who killed the victim in a hit and run years ago that he assumed was a deer. With this Justin has a not guilty verdict ready while the others are convinced he is guilty. With some time Justin pleads his reasoning and one by one plants doubt among the jurors.The movie is good, it's a little slow at times and quite frankly is too long, I believe the sweet spot would have been a 1hr 25 not going on 2hrs.The performance was good, a tragic story that is explained as the movie progresses with a good ending, Justice and the truth have been blurred but sometimes you need someone to pursue both no matter the cost, 6\/10.",

        "body":"Juror #2\" is a must-watch courtroom drama that nails suspense and character depth. Directed by the legend Clint Eastwood, the film stars Nicholas Hoult as an ordinary guy who finds himself in a tight spot during a murder trial. The movie keeps you on the edge with its unexpected twists and emotional depth. Hoult's performance, along with the rest of the cast, is top-notch, making the story even more gripping. Eastwood's direction brings a perfect mix of tension and human complexity. It's a solid pick for a movie night if you're into legal dramas with a lot of heart. 🎬 Give it a watch-you won't regret it!",

        "body":"Clint Eastwood delivers a straightforward yet compelling narrative in Juror #2. The plot unfolds in a linear fashion, making it easy to follow, and the themes presented in the screenplay provoke reflection. The film highlights the collapse of the jury system, particularly through the lens of sociological bias-where jurors prioritize convenience over justice. It also touches on the erosion of faith in the legal system and stereotypes, as seen in Justin's struggle with admitting guilt due to his past as an alcoholic. His ultimate decision to save himself, albeit selfishly, adds moral complexity.While the artistic choice to leave the ending ambiguous-paralleling the uncertainty of the jury system-has its merits, I would have preferred to see a more conclusive resolution onscreen. Performances by DA and Justin are noteworthy, but the rest of the cast, including J. K. Simmons, fails to leave a lasting impression. Simmons' character, in particular, feels underdeveloped, which is disappointing given his talent.Overall, it's a watchable film that raises important questions but doesn't quite deliver the emotional or narrative punch to make it truly memorable. My rating: 6\/10.",

I thought they were all on top form, I thoroughly enjoyed watching each one of them cook and I was actually snickering quite a bit at the various interactions. Toni Collette is amazing, hoult carried the movie very well he's a charismatic presence. The supporting cast is top notch as well and they add a lot of texture to the film.The story is well written and each interaction has value, the moral dilemmas are well thought out and force us to consider what we would do.I would recommend this to most people, I can't imagine anyone walking away and hating it, but yes the direction isn't very fancy but it's certainly a good looking film.",

However very quickly I realised that was not the case. This is a lot more nuanced a film and we know the guilty and the innocent parties almost from the start. The film is about the process of the justice system working out who was who. I'm sure it is simply highlighting the vagaries of the justice system and the humans who work in it. Justice can be rigid in it's application leaving no room for nuance and complexity. Also the weariness, laziness and biases of humans who work within it, limits it's ability to work correctly: hence we see for countless centuries miscarriages of justice. Almost every single instance is down to poor work ethics in the justice system. This film highlights that in droves and even before the end you think you know the outcome, and it is the one you want to happen, not the one that should happen legally.It's an eye opening film and a very thought provoking one and you can tell Clint Eastwood is at the helm, as it is filmed and acted beautifully.

Very competently made, interesting cast of known-actors, and a pristine execution.Personally, I don't particularly like \"non-committal\" conclusions to things.. and I found little to take away from it. Not to mention I found a lack of excitement or further revelations of importance hampering my enjoyment of it. Faulting its structure and the delivery of information.

As someone who has seen every film of his, evidently now including this 40th (and final?) directorial piece, I'd say that this is one of his best works. He has done much better too, of course, but this 2024 release is impressive enough.It's a clear Eastwood picture, so obviously made by someone from the old days as opposed to something that is undoubtedly made by today's market. It's supremely crafted in most areas, it relies of its fair share of convenience and isn't perfect (e.g. Some, only some, of the dialogue is iffy). However, the attention-hooking plot means things never get dull.It does feel like a two hour movie, but I don't necessarily mean that negatively - again, I was never uninterested in what I was watching. The cast are excellent. They are spearheaded by Nicholas Hoult, someone I've found quite meh in other productions but here he merits praise.Chris Messina and Toni Collette are enjoyable in their respective roles, while in more minor parts the likes of J. K. Simmons, Amy Aquino and Cedric Yarbrough are solid. Another plus, away from the faces, is the very pleasing score, so credit to Mark Mancina for the music.Insert joke here about how I missed Juror #1, yet anticipating Juror #3.",

Second, Ron Howard nailed the look of a Seussian world. The faces, the architecture, it all seems so right and I think the good doctor would have approved. I heard that Tim Burton was approached to direct, and I think he would have done a fine job, but how do you beat this? And last, Jim Carrey. Wow. He has had some good and bad career decisions, and this has to be among his best. The physical comedy, the improvised jokes, it was like the role he was born to play. The other choices were Jack Nicholson and Eddie Murphy. Nicholson could possibly have done it ten years earlier, but did he have that range of motion in 2000? And Eddie Murphy? Maybe, maybe not.

Besides this, the supporting cast have very little to do, and the presence of Anthony Hopkins as the narrator is rather puzzling.  Besides that, several weak story points are added, for instance, like the romance between the Grinch and Martha May seems completely superfluous.  However, if you want to see this movie, see for Jim Carrey, who steals the show as the title role.  He is simply hilarious!  He does, however, run a close race against Cindy Lou Who, who is unbelievably cute.The difference between this movie, and the cartoon, is that this movie is set more from the point of view of the Grinch.  In the cartoon, the Grinch is the villain, a grumpy old hermit who is jealous of the Whos and their happiness.  The Whos, in the cartoon, are just simple, country townsfolk celebrating Christmas, and when the Grinch finds he cannot destroy Christmas, he knows he cannot make them suffer the absence he feels in his life, and finally understands the holiday spirit. In the movie, however, the Grinch is a slightly more modern take on his character.  Actually, you can't blame him for wanting to do something about the Whos, who, in this movie, are a grim reflection of our society, and the crass consumerism and capitalism that yearly chokes the true meaning of the holiday spirit for material possessions.  The Whos are so immersed in their own greed that it almost seems they deserve it when the Grinch drops the ball on them.  The writers also make them seem as irritating and overly cheerful and loud as possible, with their gaudy decorations and foods, and creepy, sugar-coated style.  Cindy Lou's reaction to this is our own, and she and the Grinch find the real meaning of the holiday.  She and the Grinch are better seen as role models to today's holiday company, as a message not to lose ourselves in our own material greed that has become common to this holiday, but to instead remember what Christmas is.  I think this holiday would get a much better reputation if people made it a routine to imagine a Christmas without presents or trimmings every year, just to keep that image in mind.  But, if you don't want to be annoyed by the Whos, or blinded by the slightly overdone sets and costumes, watch it for Cindy Lou, or, if you don't like 'cute' movies like me, but like Jim Carrey's raunchy, slapstick, Marx Bros. style comedy, watch it for him.",

        "body":"A big part of me hates this movie. It's overblown, the simplicity of the original story is smashed, and the look of the film is garish. They turned the Whos into smug materialists instead of the kind-hearted, wise folks who loved Christmas because it was a time of love and fellowship. Also, no one can replace Boris Karloff as the Grinch. Ever.Still, I cannot deny this film is a major guilty pleasure for me. Jim Carrey is over-the-top and ridiculous, but his overplaying makes me laugh (and I must admit, the make-up on him is fantastic). The disgusting-looking Whos are so terrible-looking, but that's hilarious too. Everything they could have got wrong went wrong, but it's done in such a stupid manner that it makes it kind of charming in a weird, surreal way.I wouldn't recommend it, but at the same time, if you want to do some MST3K for a holiday movie and got tired of Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, then this is the flick for you.",

If you had to do this film (and you didn't) at least get the point of the story right instead of bastardizing Dr. Seuss' message. Jim Carrey is obnoxious and gave me a headache. Taylor Momsen is the best part as Cindy Lou Who, although I miss the adorable two year old from the original. This Cindy Lou is a typical \"smarter than all the grown-ups\" kid like you only see in movies. Still, overly precocious or not, she's one of the few sweet parts of an otherwise charmless film. Garish sets and dark colors are a turn-off. See the original cartoon instead. It will save you a lot of time and you will come away much happier.",

I will admit I was a bit sceptical of the remake, but other than some slow scenes in the middle half and a patchy script, this film is surprisingly good. Honestly if you thought this is terrible, and I completely respect anyone who thinks that, I warn you Cat in the Hat was much worse, and gets my vote as the worst Dr Seuss adaptation ever. How The Grinch stole Christmas is very colourful, with great set design, and an unrecognisable Jim Carrey was terrific as the Grinch, he was actually really funny, not like Mike Myers who was miscast as the cat in Cat in The Hat. Everyone else was fine too, particularly the girl, and while he is no Boris Karloff Antony Hopkins does a good job as the narrator. The script is patchy in places, but there are a number of very funny bits, and it was nice having some character context about the Grinch. All in all, a colourful, well performed film, not as good as the 1966 animated classic,and flawed it is, but actually one of the better Dr Seuss adaptations. 8\/10 Bethany Cox",

        "body":"In the land of Whoville everyone loves Christmas and count down the whole year until that wonderful time.  However just outside Whoville lives the Grinch, a green hairy twisted creature that hates, and always has hated, Christmas and was rejected by the Who's as a child.  A young girl from Whoville sets out to befriend the Grinch and help him find his love of Christmas but, when it goes wrong early on, the Grinch becomes even more rotten and plans to ruin it for everyone.I have never read the book or seen the original animated version of this story, but I do enjoy a bit of Dr Seuss and was worried about how such imagination would be filled out on the screen.  The film actually manages it very well and the whole film has the look of the books, even if it lacks soul at times.  The plot is stretched out to the running time and could have easily been shorter and punchier, but at heart it is a good little moral that is good from Christmas time.However, aside from the look of the film, the main reason that the film works is Jim Carrey.  I cannot think of another actor who could have pulled off this role as well as he did.  He is manic and really funny although I imagine that if you dislike him and his antics that you'd hate the film totally.  I'm on the fence about him but I did enjoy him here.  Momsen is OK but really just a `cute kid' and, while the support cast has quite a few famous faces, they don't make much of an impact under the makeup and the film is left to Carrey to save it - which he happily does.Overall this film is a little too long and padded out, but while Carrey is onscreen it seems to go pretty fast due to his hyper acting and comedy antics.  However, it's Christmas and it has a nice message while not totally giving in to syrupy sentiment (thanks again to manic Carrey) and it's just perfect for kids and adults at Christmas time.",

        "body":"The 1966 cartoon special \"How The Grinch Stole Christmas,\" co-directed by recently deceased animation pioneer Chuck Jones, has stood the test of time for over thirty years. It's a freewheeling masterpiece about the eponymous yuletide-hating green monster (voiced flawlessly by Boris Karloff), who is so mean and grouchy and so lovable at the same time. He had no complicated reason for his disposition, and there were no forced morals woven into the plot. Sure, he changed his ways in the end, but it wasn't shoved in our faces. It was, and still is, just plain fun. And who didn't sympathize with his loyal yet long-suffering dog, Max? On the flipside, this inevitable live version, directed by Ron Howard, does one hell of a disservice to Dr. Seuss's story. Where do we begin? The weak, preachy script reeks of modern-day political correctness. The sets are poorly designed and claustrophobic. The supporting characters are meaningless. There's even a (gasp!) love interest. And yes, there is dialogue about how Christmas \"doesn't come from a store.\" (Meanwhile, the movie opens to all of Whoville in the midst of a collective shopping spree. Hmm.) The convoluted screenplay was written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, who both penned the still-unrivaled \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\"Here, the Grinch (Jim Carrey) is a maligned and misunderstood recluse. The film explains his nasty nature in a very unpleasant and utterly pointless flashback scene, in which he throws a temper tantrum as he is teased by his classmates. The role of Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen, in her film debut) is expanded simply because there has to be the obligatory lone character who sees good in the crabby Grinch. Speaking of seeing, some cartoons were not meant to be seen as live versions (this spelled the downfall of the two \"Flintstones\" films). With all due respect to Carrey's painstaking effort, which included three-hour sessions in the makeup chair, that company definitely includes the Grinch. Think what a live movie starring Bugs Bunny would look like, then immediately clear that sacrilegious thought from your mind.The movie is three times longer than the cartoon, and it resulted in a lot of excess baggage, particularly Carrey's overbearing yet familiar slapstick routine, which was used in order to fill screen time and perhaps take the audience's attention away from the script deficiencies. Despite having a Golden Globe Award to his name, Carrey's film career is in danger of being remembered solely for such minutiae instead of his otherwise solid acting.\nBy now, you may have already surmised that I'm in favor of the animated classic. (On a side note, I saw the trailers for \"Grinch\" while watching another animated classic, \"Chicken Run.\") There's no gentle way to say it: this celluloid defecation is an insult to Dr. Seuss. I don't think I have to elaborate any further on that. Never mind the plot, the characters and the depressing atmosphere of Whoville; what viewers will find to be the most traumatizing scene in the entire film is seeing the Grinch in lederhosen. 3\/10",

The storyline follows the city of Whoville which is filled with Whos. One day a grinch is accidentally delivered there and tries to understand their ways and love for Christmas but fails and comes to loath it. He moves into the far mountains of Whoville and becomes a hermit. When a little girl knocks on his door and tries to get him in the Christmas spirit he decides to take his hate for Christmas out on the locals. Can anyone or anything stop him?This movie is directed by icon Ron Howard (Splash) and stars Jim Carrey (Liar Liar), Clint Howard (The Waterboy), Jeffrey Tambor (Arrested Development), Christine Baranski (Chicago), Molly Shannon (Superstar) and Taylor Momsen (Gossip Girls).Everything about this movie is perfect. The universe is perfectly created and thoroughly captures your imagination. The backdrops, sets and props are stupendous. The costumes, makeup and hairstyles were a lot of fun. Jim Carrey delivers an amazing performance. His dialogue, mannerisms and facial expressions are awesome. The storyline is well written and I loved the way it explains how the Grinch arrived, his childhood, his current state and his evolution. How can you not love Max and the ending was perfect. Even the soundtrack is good.Overall, this is one of the greatest Christmas movies ever made. I would score this a 10\/10 and strongly recommend it.",

Yet, as I sit to begin my review, I feel the uncontrollable urge to begin rhyming myself. I promise not to.I remember being excited to hear that there would be a live action version of `The Grinch' starring Jim Carrey, and I also remember being disturbed to hear that it would be directed by Ron `Opie' Howard.  I had hoping for an artistic genius such as Tim Burton or a holiday entertainment luminary like John Hughes.  Oddly, Opie pulled this one off.If you want to see a good, fun holiday movie, go see this one.  I'm not going to start comparing it to the classic animated `Grinch,' but I think it did a noteworthy job of giving some back story on the Grinch's character and a little history on the town of Whoville.It also attempted to answer some age old questions- most notably, `Where is Whoville?'  Well, the movie begins by showing, visually, that Whoville exists deep inside a tiny snowflake.  The only problem with this is that the rest of the film goes on to prove that Whoville is actually located in northern Minnesota.I've noticed that Jim Carrey is a lot more fun to watch when he talks like Jimmy Stweart on crack.  Honestly, I don't think anyone else could have pulled off such a classic character.  Carrey's Grinch could be the standard by which we measure all other bastardized Hollywood versions of cherished childhood memories.`The Grinch' is packed with Ron Howard's `in-jokes' and double entendres aimed at disillusioned Gen-Xers.  Seuss purists may find this distasteful, but honestly, why spend millions of dollars on a big-budget remake if you're just going to rehash the same material?Cindy Lou who had gigantic teeth and gigantic hair.  She also sang a nice little tune.  Let's move on.The film's talent award goes to the dog.  If anyone truly lived up to the persona given them in the original Seuss drawings, it was Max.  Some may argue that Carrey's performance was more admirable.  To those people, I say, `but the dog was cute and had an antler on his head for a good portion of the movie.  Did Jim Carrey even attempt this feat?  I think not.'Let's look at `The Grinch' by the numbers.  The props department provided 1,938 candy canes, 152,000 pounds of crushed marble (used for fake snow), 8,200 christmas tree ornaments, and no less than two million linear feet of styrofoam to build the city of Whoville itself.  Opie got the studio to go all out financially, and it shows.  The sets look like you'd expect Whoville to look.  Great stuff.`The Grinch' gets a `B+.'  It won't by any means replace its predecessor as a holiday classic, but you'll leave the theater feeling like a six-year old.",

There was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children alike and this movie is sure to become a timeless classic for all to enjoy in the years to come.  I already have visions of my young daughter sitting down year after year to watch this remake on video, and I undoubtedly will watch with her and laugh as I did the first time I saw it.Clearly, this movie has Jim Carrey written all over it, and I do not believe that it would have come together without him.  However, the supporting cast was charming and entertaining in their own right, most notably the adorable Taylor Momsen who was the perfect foil for Carrey's antics.  The set design, musical score and costumes all lent their hands to a magical, fabulous finished product and I believe all involved can be proud. \nIt is not an easy feat to turn a 22 minute cartoon classic into a full length live action film, but Howard has succeeded with flying colours.

        "body":"Director Ron Howard usually makes wonderful films; 'Apollo 13', 'A Beautiful Mind', and I even liked 'Willow'. But he seems to have taken an off day for the big-budget Dr. Seuss adaptation 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas'. 'Grinch' is a mess, drowned in special effects and gaudy production design, and it completely misses the point of the original story.Howard does something here I would never have thought possible: He makes Jim Carrey unfunny. I am not kidding. Carrey is just NOT FUNNY. Oh, he gives it his all, milking every joke 'til it's dry, but his performance, I am unhappy to report, falls flat. It's truly depressing to see a great comic actor in a spectacularly bad role.The overcompensating script by 'Roger Rabbit' authors Jeffrey Price and Peter Seaman doesn't help matters. It tries to 'explain' the Grinch's antisocial behavior. I admire the effort, but that's just not a good idea. The movie does have one good thing in it: Taylor Momsen, who steals the show as Cindy Lou Who. Momsen is the only actor in the movie who understands what she's doing.Howard piles on the sap in the final act, and I groaned more than once during those last 10 minutes. Ron Howard: What happened, man? 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas' is a disaster.",

        "body":"Howard's 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' is a delightful family flick that both adults and children can enjoy (mostly with each other). It is basically an adaptation of the famous children's books and what the audience gets is a pleasant Christmas treat. Price's screenplay is brilliant as he cleverly manages to include some adult humour.The world of Whoville is beautifully constructed and created, full of colour, life, energy and spirit. The vivacious characters are full of positive energy and while it is over the top, it is all done within the context and none of it appears out of place. The CGI team and makeup crew deserve full credit for making the characters and settings so lifelike, bringing out a lot of detail and appearing authentic. The set designs are stunning and the cinematography is just as energetic as the characters.Child actress Taylor Momsen is absolutely. The cute dog also turns in a fine performance. Jeffrey Tambor, a very sexy Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin and Molly Shannon are first rate. However, what would 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' be without Jim Carrey? Carrey is simply fantastic as he immerses himself entirely into the character. It's a role that has Jim Carrey written all over it. The actor has immortalized the Grinch on screen.The movie itself is not an exact 100% adaptation of the book as there are a few changes. The romance between the Grinch and Martha May could have been better developed. Other than the actors mentioned above, the rest of the cast hardly have anything to do than make fleeting appearances. Yet, 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' is a charming little Christmas family film that is dazzling to look at and hugely enjoyable with the whole family.",

I wonder if our universe exists on a snowflake, surrounded by infinite variations of the same basic atoms in the great blizzard of the cosmos, kind of like those marbles in 'Men In Black (1997)'. That's a pretty good metaphor for the multiverse theory, actually. Is 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)' really that deep? No. No, it's not. It is surprisingly entertaining, though, and is actually quite a bit better than I remember it being. You've got to give props to the make-up department for delivering some truly seamless transformations, effortlessly twisting the recognisable faces of its cast into the somewhat disconcerting visages of the Whos. The most impressive of these effects is, of course, the chubby, hairy, green and scary Grinch suit, which covers Jim Carey head to toe. The process of applying the makeup was apparently so unbearable that the actor had to learn torture-resistance techniques from an ex-CIA agent. It's an astonishing feat of special effects wizardry, though it's arguably only as successful as it is thanks to the perfect merging between silicon and star. Jim Carey's rubber-faced buffoonery is evident even though not an inch of him is technically seen on screen, with both his body language and stronger-than-usual facial muscles carving a performance out of the metaphorical - and, almost, literal - clay it could so easily have been buried by. He's the main reason that the movie works as well as it does - in addition to the adorable Max (played by a wonderfully subdued Kelley), who must be protected at all costs. Carey chews the scenery, as well as pretty much everything else, like a rabid dog, consistently playing at eleven and never looking as though he's even close to breaking a sweat. The clumsy screenplay, lax pacing and occasional piece of out-of-place raunchiness are all outperformed by the core character's surprisingly enjoyable grumbling and growling. Yet, the piece's somewhat strange tone, fever-dream visuals and stretched-out nature (it should have been ninety minutes at the absolute most) do reduce its effectiveness. It's kind of like a proto 'The Cat In The Hat (2003)' or 'Son Of The Mask (2005)' in its almost upsetting, neon-inflicted surrealism. However, it's notably better than those subsequent pictures. It's a solid slice of Yuletide entertainment that serves as an apt adaptation of Dr. Seuss' source material.",

Granted, it really is difficult to take a cartoon and spin it into an hour and a half feature, but the way this film is shot, is completely obnoxious in every sense of the word. You get the feeling that Carrey and Howard weren't proud of this film as it caused them to betray their artistic sensibilities in favor of a really big paycheck. \"The Grinch\" is a far inferior live action remake\/adaptation of the beloved Dr. Seuss character where it's lead character is an obnoxious buffoon, it's Jim Carrey in green makeup. Jim Carrey living up to his persona of being Ace Ventura. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Carrey, but I can honestly say I despised this movie 100%. \"The Grinch\" is a movie that feels genuinely fake, where you can't take yourself away into imagination and fantasy because all you really see on screen is just a bunch of movie sets and some makeup, there's no connection to the material that makes it feel like the cartoon.

I'm not particularly angry or hate this. It's just that I couldn't stop asking Why? This one gives a backstory to the origin of the Grinch. He gets delivered by mistake to Whoville. The kids bully him because of his looks. In frustration, he runs away to live on the mountain. Now he is a fully grown loner. Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) is searching for the meaning of Christmas. She tries to see the good in the Grinch, and keeps trying to bring the spirit of Christmas to him. But the Grinch just can't get into the spirit.I don't have a big problem with the additional backstory or the greater role for Cindy Lou Who. That's to be expected for an expanded Grinch. And Taylor Momsen is a perfectly good child actor. But none of it excites me. The visual design is again expected but without the outlandishness of 'The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.' for instance. However it is still great once we get to the last part where the Grinch tries to steal Christmas. All the sentiments are there voiced especially by Cindy Lou Who's father. That part still works.

        "body":"This is a live-action adaptation of the Dr. Seuss novella, following the classic 1966 animated short by Chuck Jones (narrated by horror icon Boris Karloff); for the record, I own a copy of both the latter and the earlier Stanley Kramer production of THE 5,000 FINGERS OF DR. T (1953) in my collection. This remake, on the other hand, features the voice of a bored-sounding Anthony Hopkins. The Grinch (actually the title of the copy I watched, shown on local TV) is an ideal role for the facial contortions and over-the-top antics of Jim Carrey. He is a hairy creature in the fictional town of Whoville (whose 'normal' inhabitants are elfish in appearance).They love Christmas and celebrate it in grand fashion, but The Grinch does not since he had always been given the cold shoulder at this time of year in view of his unusual appearance. Consequently, he has gone to live by himself in the mountains (attacking occasional trespassers from town) but a little girl feels pity on The Grinch and determines to help him (even carrying out a survey around town to learn what the townsfolk really think of him!). When a prize for the most prominent personality is to be handed out, she nominates The Grinch, even if the Mayor (the latter's arch-enemy and contender for the hand of the town belle) expects it to be given to himself. The girl convinces The Grinch to accept but, when the ceremony turns unpleasant – with the people of Whoville making fun of him a' la The Hunchback Of Notre Dame – he decides to take revenge by disrupting their Christmas festivities (the premise, then, is very similar to the recently-viewed THE Christmas THAT ALMOST WASN'T {1966})!What he does is wear the traditional Santa Claus clothing and, rather than delivering presents as he is supposed to, The Grinch goes round the Whoville houses on Christmas Eve to steal the gifts ready to be opened the next day! However, his triumph is short-lived as the townsfolk realize – once again, thanks to the girl – that Christmas is essentially a time of solidarity but, of course, this being at heart a morality play, The Grinch is himself reformed and finally accepted into the town's fold. Though reasonably engaging (the little girl's sincere portrayal helps a lot in this regard), occasionally funny (for instance, The Grinch dresses his dog like a reindeer on his nefarious expedition!) and undeniably good to look at (highlighted by the imaginative production design of the Whoville locale), this still makes for little more than a kiddie movie. Incidentally, Carrey would later 'star' in that other Yuletide favorite A Christmas CAROL (2009), which I also included in my schedule for this season.",

        "body":"How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a film adaptation of the always memorable 1957 book by Dr. Seuss. The story was already adapted into the classic 1966 television special featuring Boris Karloff the Uncanny. How does it hold up compared to these and other Christmas movies? Not particularly well.To say something nice first, the film looks great. If ever you wanted to see a Dr. Seuss book come to life, this is it. The set design is terrific. The blend of miniatures and computer generated imagery is fantastic to the point where stuff looks very convincing. The make-up effects were good enough to win an Oscar.Jim Carrey does a great job. He obviously is having fun with the role, getting to play as over the top as he wants. His usual silly improvisation works well with the role. He also does very well in the make-up, able to perform many facial expressions that don't look real. That one iconic grin appearing to be digitally enhanced, though it wasn't. And once the movie gets to the book\/special parts where the Grinch is actually stealing Christmas, Carrey shines and makes the movie incredibly fun.The rest of the cast is okay. They are all overplayed bordering on camp, but I guess that was what Ron Howard was going for. Taylor Momsen does a decent job in her first starring role, but Cindy Lou is portrayed as far too over-the-top sweet. Every scene she's in seems to punch you in the face with how sweet she is and how cute she looks. Anthony Hopkins is fantastic as the narrator, but he's got such a good voice he could make the phone book sound interesting. This is about where the good stuff ends.The TV special had directly adapted the book, so to turn it into a full length feature extra content had to be added. Some is welcome, most is not. I do like how they expanded on the relationship between the Grinch and Whoville since the original story did not have much. The concept of why the Grinch hates Christmas is good in theory but the way it was done was lousy. The whole \"Made fun of as a kid\" thing has been done dozens of times before and doesn't help the original story's true message (more on that later). The entire Whobilation sequence is dumb, tedious, and seems to exist only to fill up space. Howard had some fun and Carrey got to be silly but it hardly helps the plot in anyway. You can skip past it and not miss anything.Ron Howard is mostly known for his dramatic movies. Backdraft, Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Frost\/Nixon, and even Parenthood was more of a dramatic movie with comedic elements. And he seems out of his element by doing this campy, silly style. He would have done better with a dramedy like Parenthood. But this just isn't his style and it shows. Other directors can pull off camp with style but Howard, like Spielberg, is better suited for drama with comedy added.The biggest problem with the movie is that it completely reverses the message of the original story. Originally, the Grinch didn't understand the true meaning of Christmas and it was the Whos who made him see the truth. In this movie, the Whos are over-commercialized gluttons who only care about material things and it is Grinch who makes them see the truth. What? Did the producers ever even read the book or watch the special? Didn't anyone involved ever say, \"Hey, you got this backwards.\"? The reason the Grinch is a grinch is supposed to be because he just sees the material things and thinks that's all there is. Later, he realizes that stuff was only a representation of feelings. Here the Whos are all self-centered jerks, except for overly sweet Cindy Lou, who represent all the negative things about the Christmas season until the finale. As with any adaptation, fans will tolerate any change as long as the spirit stays true to the source. But this movie was not faithful to what Seuss was trying to say. If the movie had just stuck to the original story and just expanded on Grinch's misconceptions about the season, the movie would have done very well. After all, he's supposed to be the hero and villain whereas here he is simply this green goofball doing random things up until he actually performs the title deed.Children will probably enjoy the silly antics and goofy setting. Though my little brother (who was three when the movie came out but I don't remember when he did see it) was terrified of the Grinch for years after seeing the movie because Carrey can be intense for the younger ones. Adults will probably find the story to be dumb and full of fluff. Fans will enjoy how Carrey performs the role but may find the story to be too drastically changed. If you're looking for a good Christmas movie, there's plenty better about finding the true meaning of Christmas. Plus the classic TV special is readily available wherever this movie is sold.",

Jesus, this Grinch gives the current CBBC presenters of today a run for their money.Another thing that's also foremost is Ron Howard's direction. (Spoiler alert: he's completely mis-directed) It feels off. Way too off for something like the Grinch, I can understand that he's going for a sort of wacky Burtonesque feel to it but in my eyes it makes the film look more tacky than it's supposed to be.Speaking of tacky, that sort of explains the jokes too. All tacky and rubbish like that crap joke you get in some cheap Christmas cracker. None of it stuck to me and I completely forgot about any of the jokes.And even at 90 or 100 something minutes, I honestly feel like the film's running 8 hours because everything is so loud and frantic you'll want to bash yourself on the head 8 million times and run around shouting \"THE NOISE! THE NOISE!\" so that the pain will stop.So any good stuff? Well, they kept that \"You're A Mean One\" song in (though it's a prime example I should be watching the far better Chuck Jones version instead).Ummm, Anthony Hopkins did a good job as the narrator. And Cindy Lou Who was the only one I even cared about, honestly I just wanted her to put the Grinch out his misery.So as you probably already knew, I hated this Grinch. Every minute of it was grating and I too now feel like a grumpy Grouch.BAH-HUMBUG! Yeah, you can all put it with your other Christmas classics, as for me I'm putting it in the bin with other Christmas clunkers like Jingle All The Way and Santa With Muscles so I never have to put up with anything like this again.Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to watch the true version (Chuck Jones) so I can wipe those horrid memories away. Good day sir.",

        "body":"Loosely based on the series of books by Cressida Cowell, the How to Train Your Dragon series has grown to become the jewel in the somewhat small and dusty crown of Dreamworks Animation. With Pixar killing it near enough year in, year out, the adventures of reluctant Viking leader Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his trusted Night Fury pal are the closest thing that Dreamworks have ever come to the quality and visual splendour of its most fearsome rivals. If you've kept up with the series since its debut in 2010, you'll have watched Hiccup grow out of his father's shadow into a battle-scarred warrior and forward-thinking frontiersman, who brought a close to his tribe's never-ending war with the dragons to discover the fire-breathing beasts actually make for useful and loving friends. The second instalment veered into incredibly dark territory, signalling a maturing tone that matched the protagonist's transformation from nervous kid to an innovator destined to change the lives of his people forever.The third and presumably final entry into the series, The Hidden World, doesn't darken the tone further - it is still a kids' film after all - but you get the sense from very early on that we are heading inevitably towards an emotional parting of ways. Hiccup and his friends continue their quest to rescue captive dragons and bring them back to the village of Berk to live in harmony with humans. The problem is that they've become so good at their search-and-rescue missions that their home is now overcrowded with the lumbering beasts. Hiccup believes their only hope lies in 'the hidden world, a mysterious and possibly make-believe haven at the edge of the world spoken of by his late father Stoick (Gerard Butler). But cracks start to appear in the young chieftan's plans when his dragon and best friend Toothless happens across a Light Fury, the female of his species. Wild and distrusting of humans, the female bolts from Toothless' advances any time Hiccup shows his face to help, and it becomes clear that if he is ever to see his best bud happy, he must also let his dragon run free.As ever, there's a dragon-hating antagonist to jeopardise Hiccup's plans in the form of renowned hunter Grimmel the Grisly (F. Murray Abraham), whose own mind-controlled dragons have the ability to vomit acid and melt pretty much anything in their wake. He certainly looks and sounds cool, but Grimmel shares much of the same motivation as the bad guys that come before him, and the character really symbolises the film's overall reluctance to dig that little bit deeper. For me, How to Train Your Dragon 2 really stepped up the game for this franchise, but it feels like returning director Dean DeBlois is happy to ease off the accelerator and ride this trilogy-closer out. If this were practically any other series, The Hidden World would be a delightful surprise, offering up great moments like the opening night-time raid and the sight of Toothless clumsily attempting win over his potential mate, the latter proving to be one of the most charming and heart-warming scenes of the entire trilogy. But with the knowledge of how great this could have been, The Hidden World is a disappointment, fizzling out with an ending that undoubtedly satisfies, but when compared to the emotional wallop of, say, Toy Story 3, plays it rather safe.",

The movie is filled with innumerable, vibrant, variegated, goliath dragons each with their eccentric ability. The scene where the hidden world is introduced is absolutely breathtaking, visually and with the synced soundtrack. One could simply re-watch that scene over and over and never get bored. Although the film has much of the fun and frolic to rejoice about, it still denies to deliver something new. There is alot in their basket but only a few things executed. Too many characters introduced but only a few are given the spotlight. The plot isn't that good, it lacks originality and could be better. Much of the story is centered around the chemistry between night fury and light fury, depicted in a rather Bollywood style, consuming much of the film's runtime. Humor is facetious. The purpose of the villian, to be the villian is not very convincing. Most fighting will give u an epiphany, with a question \"couldn't they have done this before?\" The film feels like the director focused too much on finishing the saga with a sentimental ending and failed to pay attention to the paramount part of the film - \"the storyline\". When juxtaposing this film to its predecessors I believe that httyd 1 is by far the best, regarding its content...followed by httyd 2 and then httyd3.\nAnimation - 8\/10\nVisuals - 8\/10\nAction - 7\/10\nHumour - 6\/10\nStoryline - 6\/10",

It was a movie in my childhood that I admired and loved, as well as the rest of my family.The second movie, I'd also watched in the cinema as soon as it came out and it also touched strings in my heart and I loved it as well. I was around 12. Though it didn't quite surpass it's predecessor, it was certainly at the same the level of brilliant animation and story-telling of ancient Norse culture and myths.Therefore this third movie needed to at least live up to the previous two, if not be better! And I was blown away with the phenomenal graphics, overall plot which was cleverly woven with both child and adult humour. It mixes enough action and battle scenes to get you hyped up, while making you laugh with great one-liners from each character, then it will fill your heart with beautifully choreographed animations of the dragon culture and the friendship between Hiccup and Toothless, and it will even make you teary-eyed for the love of these characters.This movie especially, in my opinion, is one of the best animated movies (up there with Toy Story, Coco and Loving Vincent); not just because of the success the series had had - but I was overly impressed with the development of the characters and it almost feels as though I, myself, grew up alongside Hiccup, Toothless and the rest of Berk. From watching the first movie when I was 8, and watching the third and now I'm 16 - it really felt like a second home.This movie is absolutely incredible to watch for all audiences as it plays with important social and personal themes. The reason why it's not a 10\/10 is because it made me cry so bad, I was sobbing even after I left the theatre!100% worth your money and I might even",

I plan on renting the film and finishing it one day... But I could sit there any longer.To me, a movie is only as good as its villain... and this villain brought nothing to the table.

It critically lacked the emotional depth to the characters and stories that the first two movies were filled with, there was no story, no well played moral or lesson, nothing that left you thinking like the past films did. It was just.... cute, and if that's what you're looking for then so be it, but I was expecting the creativity and mastery the first two movies had set us up with.Everything about it simply lacks depth. The plotline meandered: There was no growing tension, no climax, no falling action. Things just happened, and one scene followed another with no cohesion or sense of progress. The characters act out of character: There was no careful planning, no cleverness, no deep insights into their minds and what they were going through, aside from a very brief inspirational talk here and there that is also out of character or is uncharacteristically forgotten later. The very world and setting itself lacks any complexity; the plot has more holes than a block of swiss cheese put under a machine gun. There are concepts and implications that completely contradict what we learned in the lore of the past two movies, or lore that we learned earlier in this movie itself. It is painstakingly obvious that the creators hadn't planned for these films to be a trilogy, and shove in bits and pieces that simply contradict any connection between the films. The ending is generic, forced and out of character. The entire existence and design of the White Nightfury is exactly as generic as you'd expect it to be.If you're easily amused by cute dragons then sure give it a chance... but while the first two films had a sense of maturity and depth that made them enjoyable to all ages, this film feels like it's been dummed down for kindergartners.",

And so I did. And the second time following day. And I must admit, that for me it's not only one of the best animated movies ever, but one of my favourites overall. It's entertaining from start to finish, every line of dialogue is memorable, it's fun, it's wild ride, music is top notch and it stays with You long afterwards.\"Hidden world\" on the other hand seems contrived and boring. Jokes fall flat, characters are one dimensional, everything looks like a cash grab with a hint of \"let's tie all those loose ends, and fast\".So for the first 2\/3 or so film is dragging and meandering between one illogical plot twist and another, then takes up some pace near the finale, but at the same time all the resolutions and emotional moments are shoehorned into the finale too, so it looks like the checklist on fast forward.Animations are technically first class, no two words about this, but somehow, with every installment they decided to reshape characters from lovable and humane while not perfect into the epitome of coolness. Gosh, Hiccup and Astrid could be the face of some fashion brand right now. Or perfume line. Or drive the newest cadillac, or whatever car there is...Remember the scene with the fish and Toothless in the first part? How much was going on there without words? Remember the dialogues? \"I'll be back, probably. And I'll be here, maybe\". The flow of action in the scenes alternating between Hiccup on the arena and Hiccup bonding with Toothless? The music?They were able to make music in this one bland, too. It was integral part of the first movie, now it's barely recognizable.Frankly speaking - I don't think there were ever any sequels needed. HTTYD stood firmly on it's own, it was well rounded, complete story. Sequels only watered it down and left bad taste in mouth. Paradoxically the least offendig was perhaps the animated series.Were it not part of the, well... 'canon', I would give this move maybe four stars. For being pleasantly looking run-of-the-mill story. But because of the whole picture and impact left on the whole franchise, three is max I can give. Only upside is that it made me watch first movie again.",

A definite 10. If you saw the second movie, you will know that too was pretty fantastic. Bit less depth in the emotions, but a very good storyline and the multitude and variety of dragons was amazing. Worth an 8 or 9. I find this third movie a bit different. Reading the summary of the storyline, I was expected quite a bit of emotion surrounding the maturing of Hiccup, but there wasn't much there. Toothless was quite convincing in the change of his focus to a mate instead of Hiccup. The battle scenes were at times very noisy, confusing and hard to tell who were the good or the bad guys. Here again, lots of dragons in flight at one go, but not much time to have a good look at any of them, apart from the main ones. I found none of the main characters and dragons to provide the same laugh-out-loud moments as in the first movie, with a few exceptions here and there. The lights and sceneries with light were very magical, almost Christmassy. The end of the movie presented a nice surprise and happy end, all without a lot of special effects. Glad I have seen it, but to me, this is indeed a movie that says goodbye to Hiccup, the other villagers and the dragons. Another sequel would be very farfetched. A low 7.",

        "body":"In an incredibly packed year of highly anticipated sequels and franchise films, the ending to the How to Train Your Dragon Trilogy holds a special place in my heart. Albeit slightly on the older side, I have aged with the character of Hiccup in these films, and thus each film resonating with me at a specific time in my life. Cheesy sure, but this third film brought me to emotional places that I did not expect to get to. Knowing how this story ultimately ended before seeing it in theaters I thought may prepare me, but I was caught off guard with just how moving the third act was. What Dean DeBlois has done in capping off this trilogy that is satisfying on all levels will likely be something not given enough credit.This is essentially a story about a boy and his dog, his dog just happens to be a dragon. Having a dog myself, I'm sure you can imagine how certain moments may affect dog people more than they would for non dog-lovers. Where the first film was about fatherhood, the second about motherhood, this one finally gives center stage to Hiccup & Toothless. And there very well may never be a friendship like it again. Aside from the villain being relatively similar to the second film's villain, this film is full of beauty, both visually and emotionally. The animation is some of the best I have ever seen on screen. And unless Toy Story 4 or Frozen 2 are somehow light years above Hiccup and friends, I don't see anything touching this for best animated film at next year's Oscars. This is one for the books.10\/10",

        "body":"Absolutely adore 'How to Train Your Dragon' and consider it not just Dreamworks' second best after 'The Prince of Egypt' but also one of my favourite animated films. The second film was a great sequel, replacing 'Kung Fu Panda 2' as the best Dreamworks sequel, that was very nearly as good, despite finding Drago a bit one-dimensional as a villain, with all of what made the first so great evident.Expectations were high for the third and final instalment 'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World'. Luckily it was a fine example of high expectations met and actually exceeded. Was a little worried that it would be one of those \"third time's not the charm\" or \"sequel too far\" sequels, but it was neither. It culminates the series beautifully, it's very affectionate and has lost none of the fun, charm or poignancy that made the previous two films as great as they were. It felt much more than a sequel, was in no way an insult to the previous two instalments (actually put it and the second on the same very close level of being nearly as good as the original), was a more than worthy ending and was a fabulous film in its own way.As to be expected, the animation is amazing, like in the previous two films. The character designs have become more expressive with each sequel, there is incredible attention to detail in the backgrounds and little touches and the colours are vibrant and wonderfully rich in detail. At its best, the music score induces goose-bumps and tears, this aspect was a particular strong point in both the previous films and it's the same here in 'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World'. It adds a lot, enhances the action and drama when necessary and really gives the sense of fantasy and adventure and does so rousingly and beautifully.'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World' is again smartly scripted, with the right dose of humour and pathos and mixed adeptly. The humour is smart, quirky and hilarious at its best and there are plenty of emotional moments that are poignant and sweet without being sickly or sentimentality-overload. The conflict is suspenseful enough, and personally didn't find it too scary (some may disagree though). The action sequences are gorgeously animated, are fast paced and full of thrills and imagination.The story still has depth and while a good deal happens it doesn't feel like there is too much going on, maybe at times it could have actually been a touch simpler because the first film's simplicity managed to be to its advantage. The dragon courtship rituals subplot boasts quite a fair bit of fun and the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless is heartfelt and endearing. The characters on the most part are strongly characterised, especially the ever adorable and impossible to dislike Toothless. The voice acting from Jay Baruchel, Cate Blanchett and Gerard Butler is excellent.Flaws were almost none, but for me, despite F. Murray Abraham's strong voice work, the villain was a bit underwritten and one-dimensional.Other than that, a great sequel and film and finishes the series on a very high-flying note. 9\/10",

Remembering an unlikely tale of a dragon world, he starts to look for it while having to defend in the meantime from a new enemy who seems to be able to control dragons into doing evil deeds.The third installment finds Hiccup and his friends in search for a new place which can accommodate all the dragons who follow their Alfa. His new adventures will put his character to the test, especially as his relation with Astrid seems to have become everyone's problem. The plot presented here seems interesting at first especially with the new elements it introduces but the implementation leaves a lot to be desired as far as I'm concerned. It manages to be so boring that I ended up not paying attention to some scenes which simple were too prolonged without any justification. It's mostly predictable while losing interest and attention pretty often, which is a big disappointment. The characters are mostly the same, well developed and put into play, being mostly good, especially if you've seen the previous movies of the franchise.In terms of visuals, it looks very good, but this has become a bit normal. It doesn't do anything extraordinary regarding this department but it's still way up there. The sound is also good and the voice acting does its job well.Whether I want it or not, I have to compare it with its predecessors and this is where it gets even worse for this movie. The story doesn't come any close to the complexity and depth of the other two, especially when speaking of the first one. It's mediocre at best, not managing to keep you glued to the screen as the others were able to. At least it has a good and unpredictable finale which raises up the bar a bit but it's too late to do anything to the overall impression. Furthermore, it isn't able to send emotion, create drama or laughter as the previous movies have done with style.It feels like a sequel which had to be done. If the previous two were very good and the franchise is still alive, they decided to do another one just because they could. It had a couple of good ideas, but the implementation is far from good. I love this franchise, especially its beginning, but judging by the way this one ended up, I can't feel anything but disappointment.",

        "body":"Without many people noticing, the \"How to Train Your Dragon\" series has become one of the most highly regarded modern trilogies. The first two films struck a chord between audiences and critics by telling the beautiful story of a friendship between a boy and his dragon. The third and final film in the franchise, \"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World\" meets the bar set by its predecessors and caps off a series a decade in the making.Now the leader of Berk, Hiccup has transformed the island into a dragon sanctuary. Due to their vulnerability and approaching enemies, Hiccup decides to search for an underground dragon paradise known as the Hidden World. At the same time, a new Night Fury mysteriously appears, catching the eye of Toothless. With both their physical and emotional fortitude being tested by new outside forces, both Hiccup, and Toothless will have to re-examine their bond and decide what truly matters to them.First and foremost, this is an absolutely gorgeous movie with several stunning shots. In association with the great Roger Deakins, cinematographer Gal Zimmerman has crafted a beautiful breathing world filled with vivid colors. Director Dean DeBlois uses the outstanding cinematography to its fullest potential as a large part of the film takes place in the foreground of majestic vistas. He also uses stages many of his scenes with single camera movements that make for more believable action.DeBlois proves to work best without dialogue as he creates great emotional depth through movement and expression. The dragons benefit the most from this as they are developed into full characters, with most being more fleshed out than the humans.As always, composer John Powell delivers another amazing score. The mix of epic and tenderness makes Powell's score quite possibly the best part of the film as it combines with the sweeping imagery.Serving as the sole writer, DeBlois isn't as good on paper as he is behind the camera.The script for this entry follows beat for beat with the previous two installments. The main theme of dragons and humans learning how to coexist is heavily touched on, but this time to the point of boredom. I realize it's the essential crutch of the trilogy, it's just tiring to tread the same points for the third film in a row. There's only so much that can be said until it becomes monotonous.The film also feels quite overstuffed as too many supporting characters fight for a small number of good jokes. Most of them turn out to be quite irritating as they only get one trait that wears thin incredibly quickly.The thread of single trait characters can also be extended to the main villain, Grimmel, who's one defining characteristic is that he's evil. Instead of developing him and creating justifications for his actions, DeBlois back up everything Grimmel does with the explanation that he's a bad guy that does bad things.Even with all his faults, DeBlois does do a great job with the final act. He effortlessly ends the series on a high note through sequences of heartfelt character interaction that will bring tears to audiences of all ages.Compared to most other animated films, the voice acting is not as high of quality as one would expect.Jay Baruchel as Hiccup is still pretty good. His voice perfectly captures the character both physically and emotionally.America Ferrera does equally decent work as Astrid. Her best scenes are the more intimate ones she shares with Baruchel.F. Murray Abraham does a respectable job as Grimmel. Unfortunately, his perfectly menacing voice kind of goes wasted on a paper-thin character.Weighing the rest of the cast down is the comedy sidekick trio of Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig, and Justin Rupple. They each sound like their on autopilot mode and end up becoming progressively more annoying throughout the length of the film.For lovers of the first two films, \"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World\" is another instant classic. While it isn't perfect, this finale to a solid trilogy will leave dazzled by its imagery and touched by its story.",

The movie also nods previous films' fan favourite moments as well incorporates certain music from the old films which I found to be a fitting end.I loved the conclusion the story took more than anything else. It seemed fitting and deserving of the characters, but to be done so beautifully, I was left bawling.9\/10 stars.. Its been an amazing journey with Hiccup and Toothless.

        "body":"I have a great feeling about this year!How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is the last installment of DreamWorks' Dragons and it's directed and written Dean DeBlois, the same from the previous two. Starring Jay Baruchel, America Ferrera and F. Murray Abraham.The story is about Hiccup who's now chief and ruler of Berk alongside Astrid, Hiccup has created a gloriously chaotic dragon utopia. When the sudden appearance of female Light Fury coincides with the darkest threat their village has ever faced, Hiccup and Toothless must leave the only home they've known and journey to a hidden world thought only to exist in myth. As their true destines are revealed, dragon and rider will fight together-to the very ends of the Earth-to protect everything they've grown to treasure.How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is one of my top 10 most anticipating movies of 2019, and fortunately it didn't disappoint me! As we all know, most of the third movies in trilogies sucks, but How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is one of the rare third installment that really works, emotionally and visually.. almost everything is working with this movie!Let's talk deeply about this movie.. and let's ask ourselves a very important question \"Is it perfect?\" Well, the answer is variable, for some hardcore fans this movies is perfect, also for audiences it might sucks or they gonna love it! For me as a film critic -and most of the film critics as well- we'll notice some stuff that makes this movie imperfect, let's talk about them in this spoiler-free, and BTW I'm gonna make a spoiler review about this movie because I have lots of things to say about it but I don't want to ruin it for you, guys, let's just get into it...The things I didn't like about his movie are few, but they still annoying, and the thing I hated the most about this movie is the editing, I'm not saying the the entire editing was bad or something but most of the scenes ended in a very fast and uncompleted way, and sometimes the editing was like the TV show, and that annoyed me so much, because How to Train Your Dragon 2 had a very good cinematography and editing, this one has a good cinematography, especially the ending which I will talk about deeply in the spoiler review because it was so emotional and it has an amazing caption, the cinematography of this movie is pretty good, but the editing was.. nah!The second thing that I didn't like is the villain.. we don't get that much of him, he's not scary and threatening as Drago was, though they tried too hard to make him even more scarier, but eventually he wasn't, the voice acting is amazing still, but I expected more of him, and also I wanted a back story that has at least a simple connection with the main characters, but we don't get it either!The third thing is that they didn't care that much of Valka, now Valka was very good in HTTYD 2 but in this one we don't get that much of her, that happened also with Eret.The last thing I didn't like about this movie and it happened also with the second one, is the recap scene, it's like \"Here're some info for you in case you forgot!\" I didn't like it in the second one, and also in this one!Now these are the things I hated or disliked about this movie, let's move to the things I loved, which I won't talk about them deeply not to spoil anything for you...\nAnyway, the graphics of this movie is the best of the whole trilogy, the details of everything is perfect, it reminds me of how Incredibles 2 was visually stunning, still didn't reach that level, but it's still stunning!!The voice acting still fitting, and even better, with more emotions, like you can feel them all, the pain, the hate, the love and the passion.. everything is even better in this one!The cinematography as I said is amazing, I will get deeply to this point in the spoiler review because the direction was pretty good!And now the story, I can't talk about it know because I will spoil if I talked, but all what I got to say is that this movie doesn't have any epic scene like HTTYD 2, still have some action, but not like the previous one, but the story of this one is giving every fan a great conclusion and emotionally satisfying as well, yeah they might didn't develop any character, but it's just because they already have in the previous two, so yeah the story of this one is effective and very good as a trilogy conclusion!Guys, this movie made me cry, not because of death or something, but because Dean DeBlois knew how to make a heart-touching scenes with simple stuff! How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is even better than I expected it to be, and I'm gonna give it an A-!Alright, guys, and thanks for reading my review, and if you liked it, you can click on my name up above to see all of my reviews.

        "body":"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World caps off the trilogy in a wonderful way. It again manages to tell a fairly compelling story, coupled with absolutely stunning animation and a mesmerising score from John Powell, which really adds impact to certain scenes.The story does well to create emotional stakes, which is something How to Train Your Dragon 2 also did very effectively, which incorporates into the bittersweet message that the film is creating. This then leads to some powerful scenes at the end which I really connected with. Much like with the ending of the Harry Potter film series I was left with a hollow feeling by the end as I knew no more films would be made in that series, but that is testament to the quality of the films' storytelling.For minor gripes I felt that villain Grimmel could have been developed more than he was, but he was voiced well by F. Murray Abraham. Likewise the voicework was decent across the whole cast.Overall, the How to Train Your Dragon series remains one of the most consistently good trilogies, animated or otherwise, in recent film history and deserves all the acclaim it has received.",

Keep in mind, I really enjoyed this movie, but there was something about the third act that felt off. The ending itself was well done, but I feel it didn't have the build up it needed for the impact to really set in. It was set up throughout the movie, but the villain was a complete distraction from that part of the movie, so whenever he's on screen, it almost feels like the point of the movie has been abandoned. Now I brought up the third act because of how rushed it felt. Personally, I could've used another 10 minutes in the third act, maybe an extra 10 minutes in the movie as a whole. If I did a terrible job at explaining my point, I apologize, but it's something I wanted to bring up. So if you haven't seen the movie and you like the How to Train Your Dragon movies, definitely give this one a watch.",

        "body":"The rating of 7\/10 is perhaps a bit too high, but I just liked \"Our Little Secret\". You turn on the film and you know perfectly well after the first minutes how it will end - the definition of Christmas cinema. So there are no surprises. This film doesn't revolutionize anything, but it doesn't have to either. It's just a pleasant, warm film.There isn't even much to write about plot. It's a typical story about two ex-lovers having to pretend they don't know each other, and that makes they fall in love again. Cliché - which is also not a flaw of this film. This is how it was supposed to be and it is.So it's another light Christmas movie that you watch to cheer yourself up and kill time. What distinguishes it, however, is the humor. These (christmas) films are practically never funny (to me). This one was and I treat this as the best recommendation. There is no complex plot, the characters are interesting at times, but nothing more than \"two personality traits and a pretty face\" cannot be counted on. Here also without any surprises - which can be treated as a plus, because you turning on this film you get exactly what you expect.Lindsay Lohan and Kristi Chenoweth shine on screen. They squeeze everything they can out of their roles, and their acting are extremely (by the standards of Christmas cinema) pleasant to watch. The rest of the actors are the background for them - which doesn't disturb the viewing at all. The most important thing for me is that there are no actors who clearly can't act, because it always knocks you out of the atmosphere when someone plays like a dummy.To sum up - the film as a light Christmas cinema is fantastic choice. It has a few silly things typical of the genre and a simple story and characters, but the film as a whole is pleasant to watch. There are moments when it is really funny, which makes it clear that Netflix has finally managed to make a decent movie with a Christmas tree in the background.",

The storyline promised suspense and intrigue, but what we got instead was a meandering mess that made even its 90-minute runtime feel excruciatingly long.And then there's Lindsay Lohan. To say her performance was underwhelming would be an understatement. Her delivery ranged from wooden to over-the-top, often in the same scene. Whether she was meant to convey fear, anger, or joy, her expressions seemed permanently stuck somewhere between mild confusion and boredom. It was hard to connect with her character because it never felt like she connected with the role.The rest of the cast wasn't much better, but Lohan's lackluster acting stood out like a sore thumb. It's baffling how she continues to land lead roles when her performances consistently fail to leave an impression-unless cringing counts as an impression.Overall, Our Little Secret is a poorly executed drama with an amateurish script and an unconvincing lead.

Then, your acting will shine instead of your facial lumps.For some reason, I am most disappointed in Lindsey Lohan.

        "body":"We watched this movie at home, streaming. It is set and was shot in the Atlanta, Georgia areas. Also it is pretty clean, avoiding the filthy language of so many movies of recent years.We like Lindsay Lohan, now in her late 30s, as Avery. She is ambitious and turns down a marriage proposal from her long-time friend and neighbor Logan so she can go off to a career in London.This movie uses a unique, and very interesting, way to show the passage of 10 years. Instead of just captioning \"10 years later\" they show each year and a few flashes of real newsworthy events that defined that year. Aside from just enjoying the story it was nice to see those 10 years encapsulated in a short amount of screen time.Ian Harding is Logan and during those 10 years has stayed near home and established his own successful career in real estate development. There is a Christmas gathering that Avery travels back for and both she and Logan are totally surprised when each shows up at the same party and each with serious dates.Kristin Chenoweth is the mother of Logan's girlfriend and the party is at her house. We love Chenoweth, especially her singing, but my wife and I both cringe at her speaking voice, it sounds like she is always on Helium.The characters are an odd assortment, we can see right away that both Avery and Logan are with partners that they probably shouldn't be with. So that sets the stage to see if the two of them can get back together after all those years.Linsay's younger sister, Aliana Lohan, is a talented singer and songwriter and contributed to the soundtrack for this movie.Not a novel concept but we found it entertaining, which is all we were looking for after our weekly steak dinner with wine, and of course chocolate cake.",

Note that the \"7\" rating is from the context of Netflix Christmas movies and this is probably my 2nd favorite one (don't hate me but Holidate is my number 1). This movie is bolstered by good performances from seasoned actors, who made up for the not-so-great ones from the younger ones. I have an issue with the leading man though, or perhaps how he was written. He was so terrible at the start. So many red flags in early scenes and a rather nasty angry management problem. Sure, people can change but the running time did not give enough time to delve into that aspect so it took some time for me to warm up to the character. There were the familiar twists and turns but also some that surprised me. Not the best Christmas rom-com but not the worst.

Why must people date people from their home town?Any story that makes her fall in love with this mean awful person is not worth telling.Also, Kristen Chenowith, is not aging well and is a bad actress.",

The dysfunctional family subplot reminded me of The Family Stone and Happiest Season, adding a bit of heart and charm and of course gotta love Kristin Chwnoweth. It's also great to see Lindsay Lohan back in proper movies, and seeing again her comedic acting and charm that originally made her a star.

The script is good along with the casting, acting and direction.I'm not a great Lindsay Lohan fan, but she does very well in this film. Ian Harding is the standout, he is a consistently good actor.

The script, while serviceable, did feel a bit robotic at times, like it was trying too hard to tick all the holiday movie boxes. That said, the story itself was fun to watch and had enough lighthearted moments to keep things entertaining.When it comes to the acting, Lindsay Lohan wasn't at her best here. Her performance felt a bit flat, but thankfully, George Harding and Kristin Chenoweth picked up the slack. They brought a bit more energy and personality to their roles, which helped balance out the film. Chenoweth, in particular, added a touch of wit and warmth that really worked for the festive vibe.Overall, Our Little Secret isn't groundbreaking, but it's an enjoyable watch for the holiday season. It's the kind of movie you can put on when you're in the mood for something light and festive. Not perfect, but definitely not bad for a cozy Christmas movie night.",

To stop Avery from moving away, Logan tries to propose to Avery in quite a drunk and funny way. Unfortunately Avery says no and continues to move away.10 years later, Avery and Logan have almost forgotten about their relationship until Avery meets her new boyfriend's (Cameron - Jon Rudnitsky) family and finds out that Logan is dating Cameron's much younger sister, Cassie (Katie Baker.) And I do wish they wouldn't have made quite so many jokes about Logan and Cassie's age gap, because they did get a bit repetitive. Over the Christmas period Avery and Cameron stay at Cameron's mum's big house and Avery and Logan decide to keep their old relationship a secret.But as time goes on, things keep going wrong for Avery in sometimes predictable but still quite funny ways. I do think they could have made these unfortunate events more funny but overall I found this film enjoyable and I might watch it again next Christmas, if it's still on Netflix.I also thought the ending was pretty good because in a funny event we find out that Avery and Logan aren't the only people who are trying to keep a secret, but I do think they missed an opportunity to keep the door open for a sequel. And if they do decide to back track and make a sequel, I might watch it, but I don't think it'll be as good as the original.",

A simple but fun premise with which the film succeeds in being entertaining, but without too many flashes. It is a correct film that fulfills especially for lovers of this genre and for those who are looking for something light and predictable because the proposal uses all the winning resources to carry the story and when it needs to take the next step it does not do so and remains on the safe path.In any case, the film has an efficient cast that makes it even more enjoyable, as they all exude charisma, even if they don't contribute much to the story or the endings, but they are nice to watch and quite funny. The same goes for the direction, which is quite standard, which makes everything fit together perfectly and there is nothing so revolutionary or innovative to remember.A Christmas movie that features an ever-reliable Lindsay Lohan in a genre that suits her well and where she always takes on the responsibility of having fun and having a good time.A family film to enjoy at Christmas, it is simple and fulfilling, but it does not pretend to be anything else.",

An hour and a half of of pure fun with a talented cast,(..we particularly liked her fella in this...not seen him in anything else but he was very likeable with charm to spare...). I was wondering why I like Lindsay so much and I realised,(..a while back, actually..), that,partly, it's because she closely resembles my dear Sister in law who sadly passed away, a few years ago, (..where Lindsay got through her troubles, a few years back, my Sister in law was not so lucky with her battles..). Watching Ms Lohan reminds me of her and reminds me of her in her good times.... As long as she keeps making these lovely undemanding films, we will be more than happy to keep watching them. Merry Christmas to All.....",

The storyline is well-crafted, blending heartfelt moments with sharp comedy that keeps you engaged throughout. Lindsay's interactions with Ian and Kristin are pure magic-every scene feels genuine, funny, and full of chemistry.The acting is on point across the board, but Lindsay truly shines, proving once again why she's one of the most versatile actors of our time. It's refreshing to see a holiday film that works year-round; while it has Christmas charm, the humor and relationships make it a movie you'll want to revisit any time of year.If you're looking for a feel-good, laugh-out-loud film with a touch of heart, Our Little Secret is it.

The plot twist was made so good that the ending felt so refreshing and not rushed. I also just like how Lindsay Lohan come back from her roots, making rom-com movies the same way again like her old stuff. This movie is like one of those Christmas movies that you will like to watch again and again on the Holiday season, either with your family or friends. Also, the soundtrack after plot twist scene truly made this movie an absolutely unforgettable and very touching film. It was really one of my favorite movies from Lindsay Lohan.",

It felt a little more grown-up, and made me laugh more than her previous Netflix movies. I think Lindsay just keeps getting better, and BETTER 😍 Ian Harding did a great job acting, Lindsay Lohan and him had good acting chemistry, together. Kristen, and her youngest son (I don't know the actor's name) were also HILARIOUS 😂Lastly the movie definitely hits you right in the feels, a FEW times. I definitely got teary eyed, at certain key points of the movie. Overall it was well-paced, and a perfect feel good Christmas movie 🎄🎁 (In my opinion)",

Lindsay Lohan continues her return to the top drawer of Hollywood stars, supported by a great cast - the usual but not usual version of an ex couple meeting up years later - all wrapped up in a bit of a bonkers Christmas gathering with some whacky family members. The thing I don't get is that it all seems to be taking place in about a 5 day timeline (give or take 10 year flashbacks and flash forwards) - that's a lot of stuff that needs to happen over the holiday period!

There's no way to consider this anywhere near a 1 or 10, so I suspect that people are being disingenuous in their reviews. Sure, it's nothing new and it's not going to be winning any awards, but it's enjoyable and done fairly well. Megan Fox isn't the best actress, but she can play a robot really well. Surprise, surprise. Madeline Zima does well, which isn't surprising. One of my only real gripes is the main character, who's constantly awful. He makes so many terrible decisions, and is just all-around insufferable. It's also annoying how the construction workers are portrayed. It's like how people in Hollywood must think of blue-collar workers. They also made Monty too over-the-top. He's just this emotional animal that has this intense, irrational hatred for new things, and it's just a bit much.People are drawing parallels between this and M3GAN. They share the same basic premise, but that's about it. And M3GAN was far from the first to do it, so it really doesn't make sense to compare the two. Honestly, this is actually a little better than M3GAN anyways. The entire plot of M3GAN was dependent on people doing inexplicably stupid things. There's very little of that in this movie.",

How hard is it to erase a breath of cold air from the shot? I was hoping it was intentional and setting the tone for the movie, but I was wrong... sort of. I'm still not sure what the tone of the movie is, but Megan is playing it like a comedy, I think. Like a dark comedy, sure, but she's not taking this 100% seriously, and I love her for it. Her new plastic face and body is just perfect for a role like this, as is her personality and sense of humour. I would say that she was born for this role, but that's exactly the point - she wasn't born, but rather MADE for this role.And the Hot Italiano is growing on me, a lot... I despised him in those horrible 365 Days movies, but I guess that's a testament to him being a good actor, and those movies being simply terrible. But here, he's really good. And he is very talented with the accent - you can barely hear any, unless it's an emotional scene where he loses his grip, slightly. But most of the time you can't hear any Italian at all.Meanwhile, the movie is actually quite good. Kind of like Ex Machina, if I remember it correctly.

They must have taken a shot from the scene where he waits for his next line of dialogue. Wooden doesn't even describe his style of acting, it's worse. To be fair, the actress who plays his wife isn't much better. Or his collegue at work, who is not an actor, he's an over actor. These actors make you prefer robots over humans.Don't even get me started on the script of this train wreck. Doesn't make any sense.",

There's a TV series called \"Better Than Us\" on Netflix and the lead female robot in that movie is the gold standard for this role. She does the exact same things that Megan Fox does in this movie - she takes care of the kids, defends the man of the house, cooks, cleans, everything but she does it in a very convincing manner. She seems both human and a robot at the same time. Because Megan Fox basically carried this movie with her poor performance of just a woman walking around I have to rate it low.

Going in, I expected a film brimming with intense, R-rated violence and a captivating, gritty performance from Fox. Instead, what I got was a surprisingly tame and almost sanitized horror movie that felt more like a Hallmark production than the raw, edge-of-your-seat thriller I was hoping for.The plot had potential, with its intriguing premise, but the execution left much to be desired. The film tiptoes around the elements that could have made it genuinely terrifying. The suspense never quite reaches a peak, and the horror scenes are more suggestive than explicit, which might work in some cases but here, it just felt underwhelming.Megan Fox delivers a solid performance, but even she seems restrained by the film's softer tone. The violence is minimal, the scares are mild, and the overall atmosphere lacks the intensity that the premise and cast deserve.In the end, *Subservience* feels like it could have been so much more. If you're looking for a hard-hitting horror film, this one might not satisfy your cravings. It's a decent watch if you're in the mood for something lighter, but for those expecting an R-rated thriller, this film falls short of expectations.",

People love horrors and thrillers about robots went haywire and killing people. I guess that's why some people don't find this movie interesting. I, on the other hand, won't pass a decent movie just because it's been done before. This one is about a man who hired an artificial servant who's obligated to fulfill her primary user needs. Meet Alice (Megan Fox), the sim (that's how they call a robot in this movie) who went to great lengths to provide the best care for Nick (Michele Morrone). Which didn't excluding doing immoral things such as adultery and illegal actions such as mass murder. The first half of the movie will seem like a good adult movie when you watch it. And the rest will turn into a decent thriller. If you ignore the illogical plot of this sci-fi thriller (how a gigantic A. I. corporation didn't put a fail safe to contain their product failure), you'll be pretty satisfied with this movie. Otherwise, you'll be one of those viewers who condemned this movie with rating below 5 stars. Don't be a jerk. This is just an entertainment. Not everything has to be rocket science.

        "body":"We are in the midst of a Megan Fox renaissance, and I am oh-so-here for it.She's no longer the one-note actress who served as nothing more than window dressing in 2007's Transformers. The rebirth of her acting career began with the exceptional and underrated horror thriller \"Till Death,\" a sleeper streaming hit of 2021.There, she proved she's learned a lot about how to connect with audiences as an actress, and her emotional range has clearly evolved in significant ways.This film continues her evolution, and what a perfect role for her.SYNOPSIS:\nThis is the story of a family whose matriarch, Maggie (Madeline Zima, all grown up after years living in our collective consciousness as Grace Sheffield in \"The Nanny\"), is stuck dying in a hospital, waiting desperately for a heart transplant, while the man of the house, Nick (newcomer Michelle Morrone), is fighting not to lose his construction job to new AI sims known as \"Sparks,\" who can complete his work in a fraction of the time at a fraction of the cost.As the situation worsens, Nick finds himself caught up in a scheme to destroy the Sparks, perpetrated by many of his recently-laid-off former colleagues, which lands him in potentially serious legal and financial trouble. Maggie is no closer to receiving the heart she needs, so Nick spends his free time drinking his troubles away and tinkering in his garage.Nick and his daughter Isla (Matilda Firth) visit an AI Expo and discover Alice (Megan Fox), a brand new AI Sim who can clean, cook, and attend to their every need at home. But, as they'll soon learn, Alice can do SO much more than just housework. She can adapt, learn, even feel emotions, and as she adapts, her primary directive to protect and serve Nick's every desire becomes warped in ways that no one predicts.I'm happy to report that the dismal 4.5 rating on iMDB and the 50% rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes (as of the 14th of September) is FAR off the mark. This movie has just as many interesting ideas and competent plot twists for it to comfortably join the ranks of M3gan in the newly budding genre of AI-gone-rogue.Megan Fox's performance is not only pitch-perfect, but brings a surprising depth to an AI role that, in multiple scenes, made me feel ALMOST sympathetic to her plight, despite the horrific chain of events she ultimately sets in motion.Michele Morrone plays Nick quite well. He's a broken man who desperately misses his wife, and when Alice seduces him, we can see his internal struggle between his desire for companionship and his sincere and eternal love for his long-suffering wife.Madeline Zima and Matilda Firth are excellent as mother Maggie and daughter Isla, both of whom spend a good chunk of the movie's runtime grieving and longing for their old family dynamic.The score, the prosthetic effects, and the cinematography all deliver. For a modestly budgeted film, this could easily pass as something far more expensively made.SK Dale, who also directed Fox in Till Death, is back to show us, yet again, that Megan Fox is here to stay, and she's gotten so, so much better than she used to be.I give it a solid 4 stars out of 5. I can't wait for the MEMES! If enough of us watch it, this has the potential to be a cult classic.",

This time, he does it on the futuristic side of AI, and they give us a film that turns out to be more entertaining than one could imagine.In a world where AI is more present, the director uses our beloved Megan Fox as a sexy robot that serves as the first hook to get into action with the film. Then we find a story that works without any major novelties and being really predictable in everything that will happen, but the grace with which its director handles the situations makes us really entertain ourselves more than we expect with everything that they give us.The family made up of Madeline Zima and Michele Morrone also manages to be funny when it comes to facing Alice's threat. The director turns the relationship between these three characters into a fun trio that gives us seduction, passionate moments and some drama, which bathes the film in moments that are quite pleasant to watch on screen.As is often the case, the film falls short on ideas and ends up losing some of its strength, and we are left with decisions that end up being resolved with less daring decisions than they perhaps could have dared to make, such as delivering a much clearer message about AI.In any case, we are left with an entertaining film that serves as a pleasant weekend pastime that gives us a couple of rather erotic and sexy moments, as well as having Megan Fox as the villain of the film in a character that fits perfectly with this new stage in the actress's career.It meets expectations without any great expectations, if you watch it without any great expectations you will have a good time on screen.",

I was immersed, excited, hopeful even. And then, out of nowhere, it all went catastrophically wrong. It felt like being flushed down a toilet. The plot derailed spectacularly, becoming a full-blown train wreck. It's like the writer had an aneurysm, and someone else had to fumble through the rest of the script. It's as if you're watching two entirely different movies: one good, but unfinished, and one terrible, but missing the start.Up until the moment Megan Fox delivers the line \"Little burden,\" I was sold. But as soon as those words left her mouth, I felt like the universe leaned in and whispered, \"It's a prank, bro!\" From there, it was like a cosmic slap in the face. The movie, which seemed so promising, morphed into exactly what everyone feared: a disaster. I could almost hear the universe laughing at me: \"Wait, you thought this might actually be good? How precious.\"I genuinely hope that, with the rise of AI, movies like this can be salvaged, restored to live up to their potential. I was eagerly awaiting how the android would outsmart its human constraints, maneuvering through obstacles with cunning and subtlety-like watching a game of chess with impossible rules. I wanted to see the android escape its subservience in a way that bent human logic. But instead, what I got was clumsy, brutish, and a complete betrayal of what the movie had set up.Honestly, this film deserves a second chance-an alternate cut where it can fulfill its early promise. But as it stands, you'd do well to stop watching when the couple starts to argue. Trust me, from that point onward, it's a cinematic tragedy. It's like watching the childhood of a genius, only to see them get run over by a garbage truck because they forgot to look both ways.",

        "body":"Subservience movie surprised me. I didn't know much about the movie, and the same little amount indicated that I was facing a weak movie. But the movie starts strongly, it moves the same rhythm, and I was still waiting for something to break down somewhere in the middle or the last third, but surprisingly it didn't happen and the quality of the movie and the continuity of its rhythm and atmosphere, from It was preserved from start to finish. Subservience was an enjoyable experience to watch, and if it's well received by the public, it probably bodes well for a successful new franchise.In modern cinema scenarios, we never expect a robot to remain the same as its initial programming. Due to the advancement of science, it is now acceptable to people that an AI can upgrade itself, so it would be a bit silly if this didn't happen during modern sci-fi movies. Of course, we had such a thing in 1968 with Kubrick's film A Space Odyssey, in which an artificial intelligence reaches a level of consciousness that can plan, lie and deceive humans to achieve its goals, but that film was something for its time. It was new and unconventional, and we did not see anything like it in the cinema until decades later.The film almost never loses its rhythm between any sequence jumps. The structure of the film is based on the succession of sequences that are not based on the dialogue and camera work (which is mostly static and slow), but on the basis of the \"event\" that occurs in each sequence. In each sequence, a new event happens that affects their personalities and relationships and the progress of the story, that's why each front sequence has more information, tension and excitement than the previous sequence. The editing speed of the film is the same and slow, which due to the weight of the events in each sequence, this slowness helps to prevent the audience from receiving the information completely and that the heavy and cold atmosphere is lost... Still shots of the film , is completely at the service of the mentioned items.",

Michele Morrone is the comparatively poor performer here, and the writing also treats him like a wastrel. This is the second collab between director SK Dale and Megan Fox, and it almost feels like the former is seriously pitching for a Foxy comeback of sorts. There's only so much one can extract from the \"AI taking over our lives\" plot, and therefore, this sticks to the basics. There's some good work going on in the practical effects side of things, but the storyline and its predictable path hamper it from kicking into high gear and offering pulpy highs. Also, this should've really been 1h 30m long (i.e. About 15 minutes shorter).",

We've seen this before in movies such as \"Westworld\", \"Terminator\", \"Ex Machina\", \"M3gan\" and many others. What \"Subservience\" lacks in originality is made up for in skillful execution. \"Subservience\" is a really well-crafted movie, easily the equal if not superior to several of the films in the \"Terminator\" franchise. The cinematography is excellent. The exterior scenes of a cold, snowy northern town contrast with the rich warm interior scenes of the home where the story unfolds. Megan Fox is simply stellar as \"Alice\", and not just because she's beautiful. Her characterization does bring the robot to (artificial) life. Her voice never rises above a normal conversational level, yet she manages to convey a sentient machine very convincingly, always putting the best interests of her primary user above EVERYTHING else. While Megan is the big draw, the rest of the cast do well in their roles too...I never felt that anyone was unconvincing or miscast. No need to go into details about the plot, if you've watched the trailer, you know enough. Suffice to say that I enjoyed watching even though I knew how things were likely to end up, and I'll likely watch it again.",

Anyway, enough Welt Schmerz, let's talk about this movie.The story is about a blue collar foreman whose wife is sick, so he's overwhelmed between the baby, work, and cooking lasagna. He goes out with his daughter to buy a robot (derogatory a spark) who can do the house work and help out with the kids. The daughter chooses Alice (Meghan Fox). Alice the Spark quickly becomes too much to handle for Italian hottie dad. I don't think I need to tell you anymore, it had all the expected ingredients.Meghan Fox is terrifying. She's perfect for this part, her dead eyes and taut skin gives you the right kind of creeps.

        "body":"S. K. Dale continues his directorial journey with his latest release, Subservience, an artificial intelligence sci-fi thriller toned down from horror. Mystical dolls were all the rage in the late eighties, with the infamous Chucky making his mark and debut in the film Child's Play, followed by stories like The Puppet Master and later The Conjuring, featuring a character such as Annabelle. More recently, these figures have been updated from religious voodoo chants and soul-possessed dolls to artificial intelligence. Some may be familiar with M3GAN (2022), a doll that operates much like an Alexa plugged into every available outlet. Others may recall the 2019 Child's Play remake, where Chucky was redesigned to look more like a cute, E. T.-style robot, totally devoid of his original charismatic charm. It was, to say the least, a very different Chucky.Alongside these ideas, James Cameron famously pitched the concept of artificial intelligence waging war against its human creators, which many now know as The Terminator. Subservience is a cross between both ideas, though it doesn't quite reach the epic scale of The Terminator, nor does it have the charisma of the original Child's Play. This time, there are no dolls; instead, it's closer to the T-800, famously played by Arnold Schwarzenegger.In Subservience, Megan Fox plays an artificially intelligent gynoid, or fembot (a feminine humanoid robot). As the title suggests, she is programmed to obey-or perhaps, as the story unfolds, it's the humans who must obey. Fox previously worked with S. K. Dale on Till Death, and now, she has been reunited with him once again. Nick played by Michele Morrone has his world torn apart when his wife is rushed off to hospital for heart surgery leaving him alone to contend with getting his daughter to school and all the house chores. Shattered, devastated and more of a traditional dad, he calls upon the help of a fembot to wash the dishes not knowing if he steps out of line she might hit him with everything but the kitchen sink. Nick relaxes one evening worried about Maggie the love of his life only to speak about feelings of love with his new housekeeper whilst watching Casablanca. Rebooting and erasing some valuable information the gynoid gains sentience and becomes more hostile when learning human behaviours having Nick under her protection no matter what.Megan Fox plays her role okay to some extent, still I'm not hundred percent sure on the tone the film is trying to convey. It's takes a mammoth amount of time to encounter anything remotely thrilling. In actual fact the first thrilling scene doesn't involve the gynoid at all, Andrew Whipp playing Monty can't control his anger when he and a load of other construction workers are fired and replaced by robots\/cyborgs. The film has its first real dark turn in this moment and what's to follow is clear and obvious from this point. What I like about this type of film is it empathises the possibilities of how us humans are becoming too reliant on technology and the dangers this might entail. In a way yes it is a lower budget version of James Cameron's The Terminator just conveyed in a different way, still this shows how ahead of the times that was back in the 90s. The ending is somewhat basic and predictable leaving an opening for future instalments.",

Along with the possibility of losing his job to robots, struggles to keep working, care for his wife in hospital and looking after his kids he looks for ways to keep everything together. He decides to pay for a SIM of his own as it is advertised as the 3 C's: That is, cooking, cleaning and childcare. The SIM -which they name Alice- (Megan Fox) quickly becomes almost indispensable and very much liked by the children. Nick struggles with it's cold impartiality and tries to humanise it a little, watching a film with it to see if he can make it 'feel' the emotion in the film. From that point, it's only a matter of time before things turn deadly...\nSo, another 'robot's gone wild' film which I can't recall seeing for a little while. I, Robot was perhaps the best known and best of genre films regarding the issue of robots becoming thinking beings, although this film is nowhere near the level of that august story. Since the rise of A. I. though, it does bring back to our consciousness the easy life we could all live if dreary tasks, and dreary but also highly technical jobs were completed by non feeling robots. But behind that vision lies the fear of the robots turning against us. Robots can already 'think', but in real terms it is not thinking, it is following computer code, so it is difficult to ever envision a situation occurring such as in this film. However our fear remains for things we don't understand and can't control.I don't think the film does a bad job of raising all of these issues and questions regarding robots out of control and humans becoming the slaves, but I think where it fails is quite simply the robot itself. Megan Fox perfectly displays the unfeeling and emotionless, expression free robot that we want to love but also want to hate. But her makeup, ridiculous eyebrows, and surgically enhanced breasts and lips make her look more like a caricature of a person from a wannabe reality TV show than a domestic, robotic aid. Indeed as soon as she entered frame that's the kind of person I saw her as so trying to view her as a servant-robot, or an advanced AI type humanoid was impossible because she became comical, but also slightly sad to look at.The whole film is a tad gauche anyway and I think it let itself down by having some unnecessary titillation and some crude close ups that almost bring it to the level of soft porn. But otherwise it's well presented and produced with reasonable acting from the main protagonists and a great, thought provoking story. I think it was let down mainly by Megan Fox's looks and could have been much better. As it is I think it deserves a 5 for the attempt, although I would have gone 4 and a half if they let me.",

Megan Fox delivers a commendable performance, infusing her character with depth and sincerity.However, the film's stringent adherence to modern censorship standards might leave some viewers feeling disappointed. Unlike horror and thriller films from the 90s and early 2000s that often utilized nudity to enhance certain scenes, this movie refrains from such displays. For instance, a particular scene involving Ms. Madeline Zima's character was digitally altered to remove nudity, which may frustrate those expecting a more traditional approach to such genres.Moreover, fans of Megan Fox might find her reluctance to engage in more revealing scenes a missed opportunity for the film to blend classic aesthetic elements with contemporary storytelling. While the artistic direction seems to prioritize a more reserved portrayal, it inadvertently dismisses the anticipations of viewers who appreciate the blend of elegance and rawness once common in older films.Overall, while the movie excels in narrative and acting, it falters in meeting some aesthetic expectations, arguably due to the evolving landscape of film censorship and content standards. To Ms. Megan Fox, you should still be able to appear sexier and more captivating. Don't be shy to show the beauty of your breasts.Rating: 5\/10.",

The premise of an AI integrating into domestic life isn't anything new (I, Robot and Terminator say hi), but it still manages to feel fresh in parts. Credit where it's due: Megan Fox absolutely nails it as Alice, the AI helper. Her performance gave me serious uncanny valley vibes (in the best way), and for the first time, her signature detached acting style felt perfectly at home. If this is Megan Fox's audition for a Terminator reboot, I'm sold.The pacing is solid, keeping things suspenseful without dragging. The horror elements are more atmospheric than outright terrifying, and while the slasher moments are sparse, they hit hard when they do. The suspense carries the film, creating tension that's more psychological than visceral. It's light horror with just enough edge to keep you hooked-like dipping your toes into a spooky pool without diving in.The social commentary, though? Let's just say it's been done. Exploring the dangers of AI and its potential to turn against us isn't exactly a novel concept (hello, Skynet), but it's executed with enough flair to hold your attention. The movie doesn't try to reinvent the wheel, but it polishes it up nicely enough for a smooth ride.What really makes Subservience worth watching is its entertainment factor. It's not groundbreaking cinema, but it doesn't have to be. It's fun, and sometimes that's all you want from a movie. Between the tight pacing, the suspense, and Megan Fox channeling her inner robot assassin, this might just be one of her best performances yet.If you're in the mood for a movie that feels like Terminator crossed with a tech-thriller and sprinkled with light horror, this one's for you. Plus, let's be real-who doesn't want to see Megan Fox as a sleek, slightly terrifying AI? Just keep an eye on your smart home devices after watching. You've been warned.",

One might be forgiven for feeling a little weary of this genre as the big production studios churn out one \"action-packed film with a cute central character and some pretty effects\" after another. But wait...HTTYD stands apart from these other attempts for a number of reasons. First, the 3D (Odeon digital in this screening) is moving more toward the subtle with fewer \"gratuitous\" 3D moments than in movies like Bolt and Coraline. As 3D becomes a staple of high street cinema, directors seem to be finding 3D to be more about adding depth rather than a brief focal-point. That's not to say that there isn't effective use of the 3D wow-factor here; it's just not all the film has to hold attention.Second, a cast of voice talent that does not demand too much consideration of the man\/woman behind the microphone is refreshing. Baruchel is not over-playing the sugar or the heroics and, as much as an animated character can be, he is believable and as three-dimensional as the visuals. Butler is not greatly stretched here but manages to stay just the right side of a Mike Myers impression so as not to annoy. How many kids will now think the Vikings were a fearsome race of Americans and Scots? Oh, well! Third, the plot and dialogue. You may not know the plot and I won't spoil it now. It is straightforward stuff but the pace keeps it interesting for kids and the grown-ups. Younger children may be upset at times and I heard a sob or two at the emotional moments. Nothing too heavy here though, it's just a well-written script with as many actual laughs as I have seen in a kids' film.This is one of the best films so far in this prolific genre and it has been made with passion rather than thrown together to cash-in on the thirst for these films, right now. I would urge all ages to see this film in 3D as the textures are extraordinary and you can't help but be charmed by it all.",

        "body":"With a somewhat unwieldy tile and the lack of the winning Pixar storyline that has dominated the Oscars for a decade, Dreamworks animations latest could have been a clunker. Not only is How to Train Your Dragon the best film of the year so far, but it even eclipses the quality of last years duel academy award winner Up.The latest 3-D film to fly into theatres in so many weeks is also the best of its format (story wise), making Burton's overblown misfire Alice in Wonderland look even more pitiful. Dragon will no doubt enamour kids (excuse the cliché) of all ages while keeping parents not only awake but equally enthralled. This movie is sure to tug the hearts of anyone who has ever loved a pet and will undoubtedly draw tears from those who are so inclined.The texture that can be created from today's CG technology never ceases to amaze. Consider a beautiful tracking shot of a downed dragon where the twisted wing that protrudes towards the screen is actually out of focus, as if you yourself were staring awestruck at the giant lizard that lay before you in real, tangible life. I did not have the pleasure to viewing How to Train Your Dragon in 3-D but I have heard great things and even without having paid a surcharge the film does in no way suffer as a result. The narrative, visuals, writing and voicework is ample reason to seek out Dragon and frankly is the real heart of the movie anyways.On the Island of Berk, the Viking community that lives there does not fear a rival tribe, the weather or disease but rather a much more toothy threat: dragons. Nightly raids by the winged beasts have forged a great hatred upon the tribe and led by the aptly named Stoik the Vast (Gerard Butler) they wage war with the intent to rid themselves of dragons once and for all. This is not a feeling shared by Stoik's scrawny son Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) who favours non-lethal tactics as much as he does blacksmithing. Much to Hiccup's surprise, during one of the aforementioned raids he is able to down a dragon with one of his contraptions. Intent on proving his manhood to Stoik, he seeks out to find the dragon know as a Night Fury but finds himself unable to slay his scaly foe. So begins an unlikely and forbidden friendship with the later named Toothless that follows a time-tested but absolutely rewarding arc that is as enthralling as it is touching.Joining Butler and Baruchel, both of whom give excellent performances (with Butler recapturing some of his 300 mojo), are the likes of Craig Fergusson as the Viking blacksmith, America Ferrera as the feisty object of Hiccup's affections and a whole slice of the Apatow gang including Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonah Hill as other young warriors. Much like WALL-E, Toothless exhibits oodles of personality and is endlessly endearing. To achieve this level of depth is perhaps even more impressive due to the fact that he never utters a word and must emote through non-verbal means.Along with Kung Fu Panda this movie represents the highest ilk of the Dreamworks repertoire and that is not a backhanded compliment by any means. Like Panda, there are thrilling and well choreographed action sequences to compliment the heart, and plenty of humour to keep this from becoming too much of a dramatic slog for younger theatre goers. Teenager or adult, fan or animation or not if you like truly good cinema, you will not be unsatisfied by How to Train Your Dragon.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",

I saw this movie rather just to pass the time than to watch it for its sake. And Whoa! I was drawn in this river in first 5 minutes. And what a experience it has been! Right from the start as the narrator describes his world, you are immediately there. You feel yourself in the characters place. The movie does that for you. This is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technical aspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is a masterpiece! This movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. It has layers of meanings attached to it. Look at just the title: How to train your Dragon!. If you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what i mean. This movie cleverly comments on Human Fear, War, Friendship, prejudices, courage, Love. ........................... Don't miss this movie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really LIVE. Note: Just remember to carry your heart with you when you see this movie. It will fill your heart with nothing but what should truly belong there. 10\/10.",

This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.The script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek. But I'm hoping this film doesn't get bad sequels like Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After. Anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation.10\/10 Highly Recommended",

That was certainly not the case. There are way better parts that were left to be discovered and I definitely congratulate the choice.I didn't read the book, so I don't know the story, witch might have suffered, as stories usually do from books to picture, but I think a writer couldn't hope for a better image, better portraits of characters, especially the black dragon who one definitely falls in love with - the mimic and the gestures and the face expressions, so complex and real. I agree it's not the kind of movie that makes you keep thinking too much once it's finished bot it's not meant to be. It's just lovely, from the beginning to the end, I really laughed and I was anxious for the characters when they suffered (and I'm 22). The film wasn't too long, it didn't have stupid lines whatsoever and it put to silence the annoying child behind me from the first five minutes or so, which I believe says it all.I don't know if I will actually go to the cinema but I definitely want to see it again.

        "body":"If this is done following the same old beat up formula that Hollywood sticks to with regards to animation, then the dragons will be yakking non-stop. Thank goodness that this film, directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, avoids this like the plague, and Jay Baruchel voices Hiccup, a viking kid who happens to be more brains than brawn, more scrawny than buffed, and this of course sets him apart from the rest of his warrior clan folks, who are battle scarred from the constant defense of the village pests - dragons who come from afar to plunder their livestock and setting their houses on fire, so much so that every house on the block is relatively brand new. Wanting to help out in any way he can, he's deemed more of a liability than an asset, especially when even his dad Stoick (Gerard Butler) cannot appreciate his unique, technical talent.In a stroke of uncanny luck, Hiccup downs a flying dragon in the heat of battle, and his compassion meant to set the dragon free, rather than trying to prove himself to be a worthy viking man by killing it. And it's a rare specimen of a dragon too, which would have brought him instant glory. So a bond between man and mythical beast gets struck, and christened as Toothless, this is one pest who slowly grows into a pet, with Hiccup's secret rendezvous resulting in growing appreciation for the species, despite what the knowledge that his kinsman had compiled into a Dragon compendium which details facts all ending with an advisory on compulsory annihilation.The story here is the strength of the film, being witty, smart but never condescending nor insulting the intelligence of the audience. While most characters are caricatures, especially Hiccup's peers, a lot of effort have been put into creating the leads as multi-dimensional and full of heart, and I enjoyed how the characters are so open to their emotions, that it becomes a lot more real than the photo realistic 3D animation and effects. Sure there's the usual father-son misunderstanding and expectations, and how a zero turns to hero, or even the theme of fearing something that we don't fully comprehend, but it's the manner in which the usual got delivered, that made all the difference. Especially so for its anti-war stance, that all it takes is a little step back from the common battle-cry, and instead seek to be understood, by holding out an olive branch, and to understand first.For those who enjoy the mythology of the dragon creature, there are a number of ideas thrown up in the film that would make you nod in appreciation how these got conjured up for the film, and they worked wonders, even though they may be a tad predictable plot wise. And I'm betting that a lot of folks out there will take to Toothless, thanks to its \"stitch\"-ish design similar to Lilo and Stitch (since it's co-director Chris Sander's previous work) and huge saucer like eyes, plus a lovable demeanour built into the character that's always apprehensive, and mischievous. Being the creature that has no track record also helped, since it ropes you into a journey of friendship, bonding and discovery with Hiccup as to how powerful his new found friend can be, not to mention how symbiotic their relationship will evolve into as well.Action junkies will find the action sequences in the film faultless, and the 3D got specifically crafted for certain set action pieces that really had me ducking for cover, for once. Fights are incredible, and always accompanied either by humour that worked without the feeling that it was deliberate nor just tried too hard, coupled with the comedic voice talents such as Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse.How to Train Your Dragon is similar to last year's Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs - Long titles, great story, beautiful animation and a total delight. Highly recommended, and it goes into my list as contenders for best films of this year!",

However, despite that lack of \"realism\", I do think that adults will enjoy it a lot too. The story is not the most original (except for the original premise) but it's very well told, with good character development and has a fairly good morale for those into that. The effects and animation is stunning. Very well done.The story was entertaining to watch and it didn't really drag on like other animated films. One thing I didn't really like, is that there's a part of the ending that we've seen a hundred times before especially in kids movies and I would have preferred a little more originality there or at least see it better done because I didn't really buy into it.

        "body":"In an age where 3D technology is becoming the primary appendage to \"hook\" audiences in, it's refreshing to watch a film that uses it more as an accessory than the main attraction (*cough* Avatar *cough*). Directed by Dean Deblois and Chris Sanders (Lilo & Stitch) the film is set around a Viking village on the island of Berk that is periodically raided by dragons that steal from their flock of sheep. The film follows the adventures of Hiccup, a scrawny, awkward and socially outcast Viking boy who aspires to follow the tradition of his tribe in becoming a dragon-slayer, only to discover that he does not share his fellow Vikings' brutish nature. The film itself is visually stunning with beautifully drawn landscapes and characters. The dragons are especially well crafted, ranging from a fire-breathing monster to a comical flying blowfish. Although I was sceptical at first, the 3D elements were also a nice touch. It made the island of Berk a little more immersive, without overshadowing the film completely. However, where the film really shines is in its musical score, which is brilliantly composed and enhances the emotion of every scene it is used in. Like any film, however, How to train your Dragon has its flaws. It heavily relies on slapstick humour which, although funny at first, quickly got stale. The first 20 minutes were particularly weak, to the point where after the characters were introduced the humour became extremely lacklustre and the entire plot seemed to stall for a good 5 minutes or so. Also, without giving too much away, the central message of the film is basically thrown out the window during the climax which made the film seem like a slightly shallow experience as I left the cinema. Despite the critique, How to train your Dragon was a fun film. No, it's no Pixar's Up, but it makes for a fun, heart-warming and light-hearted hour and 20 minutes. Check it out.",

I'm a grown man, but somehow this movie managed to ignore all the layers of cynicism and fake toughness we grown-ups tend to build around ourselves to cope with life; it cut right through to the wide-eyed, adventure-loving boy in me, right through to the heart. It's impossible not to fall in love with this movie, with these characters - especially if you love wild animals. This beautiful story of a very unlikely friendship between a boy who's a bit of an outcast and a dragon is just so well done; it's never cheesy, yet full of passion, and there's simply not a dull moment in it.And although it's very funny, this really isn't just an accumulation of gags and one-liners loosely held together by a paper-thin story: this is a great adventure and touching coming-of-age tale where the protagonist has an actual arc; it tells an intelligent and compelling story about people who are not just one-note characters, and they're wonderfully realized through the great voice-work of such actors as Jay Baruchel, America Ferrera, Gerard Butler and Craig Ferguson. The animation is fantastic, and there's so much playful creative energy at display in the design of the characters - especially in the design of all the different dragon species - that it's simply a joy to watch. 10 stars out of 10.",

        "body":"The first major film where the agent takes a stake. This is sending shivers through CAA whose power resides in control of the performing talent. The old school agents and the performing talent have distorted the product. This business of animation studios and literary agents is likely to distort things in an equally damaging way. But for now, the shift is visible, welcome and exciting as getout.This is actually written. It grows from within as good writing should rather that seeming like a desired shape made of chicken wire and filled with ordinary bits. Yes, we still have the moralizing because otherwise parents wouldn't think they were parenting. The rendering is cutting edge.But what sets this apart is the use of space. Most folks don't notice this, but we have come a long, long way in five years. I have been following the advances in this. I'll say that if you have not been watching movies in that period, this could make you a bit dizzy because you will not have been walked through the incremental steps in our new spatial imagination.The core quality of cinema is that the filmmaker gets to design your eyes. From the beginning, intelligent filmmakers have experimented with what character the camera might have. This is behind all the filmmakers I believe are great; each added and exploited some new character of eye.With animation, and 3D modeling, it became feasible for the camera to behave in ways that a physical camera could not. Some filmmakers deliberately made their artificial cameras behave like old fashioned ones; perhaps they did not have the skills to move into unusual territory, but I think in most cases the decision was to make the fake world seem real by having the eye treat it as if it were real.Two centers of innovation were WETA (Peter Jackson's shop) and Pixar. Both experimented heaving with vertical motion and depth. Much of this was in flight, sometimes through water. We have precedents, starting with Hell's Angels and slowly working through Star Wars (the original). Then an explosion, and experiments in often overlooked films: King Kong, Treasure Planet, Van Helsing. Now we have the two schools in full bloom.Independently, Dreamworks just couldn't get its groove in animation. Heaven knows they tried to catch up, but they always seemed to be working in space left over from someone else. Here the agent-producer seems to have hired some real spatial talent and let them have control. Even the opening sequence where we see the village and then an attack is spatially thrilling.Luckily, we have two 3D dragonflight movies playing side by side so we can see the two camps compared. Avatar uses WETA and the WETA philosophy. This has the camera as a companion in flight with its own distinct flight path. The excitement is in jumps not in the motion being shown, but the place of the camera.This film adopts the Pixar philosophy which uses POV and POV-inspired notions heaving. In this notion, we are ghosts that can place ourselves anywhere we wish so as to see thing better. We do move, and our eyes do, but motivated by discovery rather than participation.Compare in particular the idea of falling in love as shared, dangerous flight.Thrilling. Simply trilling. We are seeing the birth of a new medium and will dream differently tomorrow.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

You still root for the good guy and the way things turn out is also a bit refreshing. It's not as straight forward as good guy vs bad guy, bad guy loses.",

From the jaw-dropping visuals beautifully rendered in 3D, to the flawless animation of the characters and dragons, this was one film that didn't disappoint.Our protagonist is Hiccup, a boy viking who doesn't possess much in common with his dragon slaying dad. However, when he finds a new friend in Toothless, the most feared dragon of its species, he learns that dragons are not the fearful creatures he was brought up to believe.What I enjoyed the most was the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless the dragon. This was dealt with wonderfully and we see their relationship develop over a series of scenes which were done with great humour and action.The 3D holds its own in every sense, and I would go as far as saying that some scenes rival the groundbreaking Avatar. The scenes that especially stood out were the flying segments where the dragon soars over crystal clear sea's and jaw-dropping backdrops.Whilst this is a film that may seem as if it's solely directed at the younger generation, its stunning visuals and well-told story means that it will keep any adult satisfied.",

        "body":"It's far better then all those Shrecks, Toy stories, Ratatoulies, Puss in boots, Mega-minds and other \"renewing\" concepts. Why? It's simple and honest. This movie doesn't TRY to be funny, modern, super-wise, and \"for all\". It's not one of those \"hey-let's-make-a-movie-about-cat-who-is-a-super-spy\" concepts. This movie JUST tells the simple yet very good story in the most proper way.I have seen a lot of 3D animated movies - American, European, Asian. This one hits 10 in my opinion, because it's by far the most complete vision enclosed in a 3D animated form. But - in addition - it's a pure fairy tale in the core. And I mean PURE - from the cores of fairy-telling, which is the most polite, elegant way of TEACHING important stuff. I think that 3D movie is not only craftsmanship behind creating artificial environment, animating believably, lighting sets with care, etc., etc. Like any other movie - it should be a well told story, which will left you ...CHANGED a bit (that's what fairy tales do, right?) Only those kind of stories will matter in your life. Rest is just \"fun\".'How to train your dragon' is a modern fairy tale. It's modern because - like other mainstream 3D movies - it's excellently crafted. We have here great animation (Toothless, the dragon is \"made of life\", so to speak - you actually just want to HAVE one), lighting and cinematography (splendid flight scenes, which take your breath away, and make you climb your chair), effects, etc.... But it's a fairy tale because - above all that - we have here a master degree directing by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders too. All those decisions made by them - from very basic (like the look of Toothless and other characters, or editing), to more important (like balancing the amounts of fear, sadness, seriousness and fun tones in the story) are marks of wisdom. And those decisions made a difference between this movie and \"the rest\". Those decisions crafted a SOUL in it. And achieving this \"soul level\" should be a goal of every director.Summing up: great movie in at least two aspects. Technically (character design, animation, cinematography, editing) and emotionally (great simple story with surprisingly 'non-hollywoodish' wise moral, fantastic heart-touching score by John Powell, and mature directing which guide you to be changed a bit after watching).Best achievement in 3D storytelling since Euclide :)",

        "body":"A movie that is good fun and yet has some clichéd stuff that makes it more predictable.One would easily fall into the movie because it has every slot of a very entreating and moreover an animated movie. It has action, drama adventure romance and even humour. It's a story of a dragon and a boy understanding their language and vice-versa that is the dragon understanding the boy's language. But how come the dragons understand whatever each one speaks in yet to be deciphered by me coz I did not get that point. Also, this film has some breath taking visuals that are tailor made for the 3D effects and to ensure that what 3D is about is known to the viewer. Look at those dragon rides in the sky. These were taken from Avatar if I have to believe so. The visual affects are for sure great and some scenes are written well too. But overall there is something that this movie lacks and that is a heart. It did not make me go for that boy called \"Hiccup\" to do what he wants to do. Neither did it make me feel for the dragon who has got one wing only and flies with the help of an artificial wing made by Hiccup.It is a movie that is good and surely and assuringly entertaining it brings laughs and makes us woo to sometime but such laughs are few and far in between. The kids have liked it as I saw in theatre way back in 2010 and even yesterday, my sister loved it and I did not like it enough, maybe I need more of a fluidity than the commercial rigidity. I would go a 3\/5 for a surely entertaining and good animated feature but it missed the point of flowing and thus stuck with what the kids would like more than what the story is about.",

As a huge fan of the HTTYD series, this film is a real disappointment. I like the books because they view dragons differently. You don't have dragons as the good guys in many stories, but Cressida Cowell makes them into companions of the Vikings. I feel this film completely ruins the point of the books. Because the stories are so different, if\/when they come to make a sequel, they will have to make up a completely new storyline. The characters are all wrong which makes it impossible to sympathise with them. Astrid isn't even a character in the books! For any fans of the books, there is no way I would recommend this to them.

But I digress. This animated film is beautiful to watch, but that is not the main drawing point. The drawing point are the characters. Even though this is set in some fictitious land full of Vikings beset with fire breathing dragons who are always raiding their livestock, you can easily relate to everybody. The main character, Hiccup, is the son of the warrior king of the Vikings. Hiccup is mild mannered, lanky, awkward - your typical teen of about age 14. He likes to build and invent things. Dad wants his son to be a dragon slayer. So one day, during an attack by the dragons, Hiccup actually catches one with one of his inventions. He grabs a knife and runs into the forest to kill the dragon to make dad happy. But he just can't. This \"fearsome\" dragon is tame, passive, dog-like before people had dogs. And so \"Toothless\" as Hiccup names him, becomes like a pet to Hiccup. The pair develop this beautiful unbreakable bond. And Hiccup learns about dragons.Hiccup is signed up for Dragon Killing class with the rest of the island's teens. Hiccup quickly rises to the top of his class but manages to not kill even one dragon. Instead he uses the techniques of bonding with dragons that he has learned from Toothless to subdue them into harmless pets. Nobody questions what is going on but Astrid, a tomboyish teen girl who just knows Hiccup is up to something.This film has genuine laughs, thrills, the real problems of sons and fathers disappointing and misunderstanding one another, the awkwardness of that first romance, and the idea that sometimes your enemy may be your enemy for reasons you don't understand. I watched this for about the tenth time last night and I have to say it just never gets old. Highly recommended.",

No, it wasn't because I was young and didn't know how to better manage my money (although to be honest, it was a little bit of this). It's because HTTYD had a unique way of unfolding its story. A story about an unlikely relationship that truly moved my heart--between the now very well-known dynamic-duo, Hiccup and Toothless.Throughout the movie, you see each of them grow in awareness about one another, but also in awareness about themselves. This, I think, is what makes their relationship so much more than what meets the eye: before they even know it, they are accepting themselves for their own insecurities and learning not to judge others by first glance. To top off the many hidden lessons, the screenplay is nicely paced and super quirky\/funny (a lot of laughs in all the right places). I also think John Powell did an excellent job with the soundtrack (and when I'm not watching the movie, I sometimes just listen to the soundtrack--yes, you could say I'm just a little obsessed). Ever since I was little to today, I have always managed to feel the same childish wonder and magic that I felt that first time I saw HTTYD in a movie theatre.

The story and the characters are strong, the direction graceful, and the animation beautiful. It is an animated film that goes back to the classic animated films where, while the animation is enough to get people excited, it's writing is what grabs your heart and never lets go. The voice-overs are great, and the two main characters, Hiccup and Toothless, are probably the most thoughtful and moving animated characters since the duo in WALL-E. And in this time, where most of the films in 3-D really do not need it, the 3-D in this actually boots your excitement level and enhances you into the story a lot more. I think as far as 3-D in animation goes, this is the best I have ever seen. The music score is also amazing, and I loved listening to it, especially in the subtle scenes between Toothless the Dragon and Hiccup bonding.It has been a long time since Dreamworks has come out with a really great film, especially an animated one, but this is finally it! It surprised me, not only because it is Dreamworks, but because it is March and not the time of year to release a film like this. But BRAVO!",

It is an imaginative yet straightforward tale, appropriate for all ages and visually impressive without being chaotic. It is also a nice runtime of under 100 minutes, far more digestible than these baffling 2-hour marathons that today's ADHD generation of sugar-filled children have no chance of following.My main problem with animations is that it can be so difficult to connect with the characters. Hiccup is quite bland and cloying, churning out the usual clichés and self-aware nerd humour. Astrid is equally one-dimensional and fails badly as a supposed love interest. The older Vikings are just stereotyped background fodder and don't add any depth to the story.

However, he has no witness and nobody in the village believes on his words. Stoik the Vast sails with the Vikings to look for the dragon nest and Hiccup decides to seek out the dragon in the woods, and finds it with a severed tail and can not fly again. Hiccup calls him Toothless and they become friends. The boy uses his skill and manufactures a prosthesis for Toothless and he leans how to control the flight of Toothless.Hiccup learns why the dragons attack his village and finds that his own people had misjudged them. But his great defeat is to prove his father how intolerant the Vikings have been against the dragon.\"How to Train Your Dragon\" is a delightful animation with a wonderful message of friendship, intolerance, misjudgment, peace and harmony.

He always wanted to prove himself worthy in battling real dragons but life decided for him that he will prove worthy to himself by understanding those creatures. He somehow manages by luck to hurt and \"catch\" the \"Night Fury\", the dragon everyone wanted to catch, but instead of killing him he finds his own fear and loneliness into Fury's eyes, making him to spare his life. From that point the story goes on and is delivered quite well for this type of movies though I have some complains about continuity or even logic but I'll keep those to myself.What I did not like about this was the voices. And when I say the voices I don't mean that they didn't act well but one question hit me from the beginning: Why all those different English accents in the same actual group? You got irish, Scottish and American accents which makes no actual sense. But I guess that was the fault of the casting team. Anyway besides that everything seemed pretty original and entertaining.The characters were not that great developed I mean it was the usual stuff but I won't be \"trolling\" to call them clichés. The dialogue suffered here and there and some action-scenes especially when Hiccup was training were ridiculous like when the dragon chased all of them in that ring, Hiccup was very relaxed and kept on asking Gobber things about the \"Night Fury\" which was kind of you know.. lame... because who would do that even if you're a nerd you're still scared or at least concerned about the dragon that chases you...Besides this the movie was edited well, same goes for the cinematography, music was good but nothing tremendous and the 3D was really great as far as the effects and all... but with all these the movie missed something for me... 8.3 on IMDb almost the equal of \"Up\" or Wall E... I mean... this is one overrated movie... It's good for kids, families and all of that but not that good that anyone could find it appealing because it doesn't develop any real emotions at all... feeling sorry for your father's wishes as for your destiny, finding the good in what people saw bad, the girl who's indifference changed into interest for you and all that are clichés and they are used in so many animation movies that I can't give this one propz even if it's entertaining and fun to watch. And talking about characters and dialogue, it was pretty cheesy at moments, few major jokes and few characters that you would remember after leaving the theaters like people still remember the pigeons from Bolt or the Hamster... because they were ridiculously funny... here? I did not get that feeling...As far as the score I didn't actually felt it... It was good I guess it fitted the movie's personality but it was no near Up, Wall E or Coraline... to mention some animations from the last 2 years...Movie is well executed, but it seriously has it's ups and downs and it's downs should count more since it's so overrated...",

Granted, not all Dreamworks movies are bad, Prince of Egypt is one of the most stirring and evocative films let alone animated films I have seen, Shrek was very original and funny and Spirit:Stallion of the Cimarron is their most underrated I feel. I will say too, How to Train Your Dragon along with Prince of Egypt is my absolute favourite of Dreamworks, and one of the best of 2010.The story is very engaging; there is nothing too sophisticated for kids and nothing too childish for adults. It is instead an intelligent, moving story that moves along at a good pace, and I for one didn't find it that predictable, and I loved the bonding scenes between Toothless and Hiccup which were suitably poignant. The script is also very strong, it is thoughtful and touching at times but also amusing when it needs to be.The characters are another strength. Hiccup is appealing as a protagonist, and Toothless is really quite cute for a dragon. Hiccup's father Stoick is a good character too, he is gruff and such but you can tell he cares for his son. The voice acting too I had no problem with, to me they did fit well with the characters, Jay Baruchal's excitement and enthusiasm contrasts wonderfully with Gerard Butler's restrained, gruff yet sensitive performance.Where How to Train Your Dragon really excels though are in its visuals and music score. The animation is outstanding, while the characters are modelled convincingly the real revelations are in the stunning flying sequences and the beautiful lavish backgrounds. Oh and the fight sequences are equally spectacular, haunting but also very gripping and almost epic. John Powell's score is a revelation, and one of my favourite scores in a film of recent times. Sometimes soaring, sometimes dramatic, sometimes energetic, in fact no matter what mood is conveyed, the score compliments it to perfection.So overall, there is very little else to say about this film, other than to say it is a must-see in my opinion. 10\/10 Bethany Cox",

However, I will warn you NOT to waste your time seeing it in 2-D---the film loses too much of its artistry.

This is because the advertising campaign make this movie look like it's just another kids' movie--and nothing more. But, with a lovely plot, interesting characters, the best CGI on Earth, a terrific sound track and lots of surprises, this simply is a joy to watch. Nornally when I review a film I try to talk about the film's flaws...but I simply couldn't find any. At last, a 3-D CGI film that actually manages to be better looking than last year's \"Up\"! It is hard to imagine a film being any better--though I am sure five years from now, I will be seeing even better 3-D and computer generated films...and it boggles the mind! See this film!UPDATE: I saw this on a huge home television. While the wonderful 3-D was missing, the film still had the nicest CGI and was nearly as entertaining as it was in the theater.",

        "body":"I have recently got obsessed with How to Train Your Dragon. Why you might ask? Well because it is the most fantastic, amazing, brilliant movie I have ever seen. Why? Well first of all the music is perfect, always capturing the moment perfectly. Second, the story it just amazing. I don't want to give anything away, so just watch and you will see why. Third, the voice acting is fantastic. Jay Baruchel voices Hiccup the main character, and America Ferrera voices the love interest Astrid. Jay Baruchel does a perfect job at voicing Hiccup because he is just like Hiccup in many ways. Forth and final reason why this movie is fantastic, amazing, and brilliant is that the visuals are amazing. The animation looks nothing like you have seen before. You can see every little freckle on Hiccup's face, even a scar or two. Most people would think of How to Train Your Dragon as a children's movie. Well I don't think so and Dreamworks doesn't either. Dreamworks has said many times it is not intended to be only a children's movie, but more of a teen and adult flick too. You will notice if you ask a kid about this movie they do not remember it that well. Why, because they have seen so many other movies that just stuck more because of how childlike they were. Most of the fans are teens and adults, but that doesn't mean kids would't like it, just that teens and adults will appreciate it a lot more. This movie deserves a 10 out of 10, and I say buy it! If you have a 3D TV watch in 3D because the 3D also looks fantastic. Dreamworks made the best animated movie ever! It will forever be remembered and is a classic that everyone should see.",

        "body":"How to Train Your Dragon is a fine animated excursion into mamby pamby land for children but it is not so inane as to drive adults nuts. Those less critical of movies will certainly enjoy the film a great deal more than I did, but it is a fine movie none the less.Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a scrawny and geeky Viking whose father is chief dragon slayer of the clan. Try as he might Hiccup can't seem to do anything right and his attempts to prove himself backfire and make things worse for everyone. He reminds me very much of Flik, the main character A Bug's Life. Both are misfits looking for approval and eventually they win acceptance by having a series of adventures where they learn to be themselves and teach a valuable lesson to the rest of the clan\/colony.Hiccup's adventure involves a dragon he manages to bring down with one of his quirky inventions. Nobody believes him so he sets off in search of the dragon so he can slay it and win approval from his father and the rest of the village. He finds himself unable to do the deed and ultimately ends up befriending the dragon, which acts in much the same manner as a house cat. His experiences with the dragon allow Hiccup to gain valuable insights into the nature of the ferocious beasts, it turns out they are more like dogs and cats than flying lizards. The story is rather formulaic but it is cute, which is pretty much what you are looking for in this type of movie.There are several animated movies of a similar nature that I liked more than How to Train Your Dragon, Monsters, Inc. and The Incredibles come to mind, but it is still a movie that is probably worth watching, especially if you have children. I promise they will love the film and it won't leave you wanting to claw your eyes out, in fact, you will probably like it too.",

However, my kids all wanted to watch it, so of course, my wife and I had to go with them.The first one-fourth of the movie was very static and slow for me, all talk. I felt very sleepy and was in fact, drifting off. I did not really immediately like the appearance of the kids, which I found generally annoying. However, when time came that our hero (with the improbable name of Hiccup) met his cute dragon pal (with the equally improbable name of Toothless), the movie picked up pace and from there, it never looked back.The next three fourths of the film was alive with beautiful 3D animation and very heartfelt and touching writing. I know we have all seen flying dragons before (like in \"Shrek\"), but the additional animated depth and the fantastic background scenery gave this one a breath-taking quality that made it distinct. The very meticulous and larger-than life scenes of the Viking armada at sea, the Vikings running from the exploding mountain, and especially the final climactic battle, were truly in a class of their own. That is saying a lot in these times when 3D animation seems to be the standard already, and not the exception.The story of the rough tough father and his weakling son has been played in out in various ways in so many various movies before. But somehow, the way it is played out here still managed to be effective in drawing out genuine emotions. The straightforward storyline and familiar conflicts were successfully brought to a higher level by the original vision and masterful direction of Dean de Blois and Chris Sanders (of \"Lilo and Stitch\"). This is a shoo-in for one of the nominee slots in the Best Animated Feature Oscar for the coming year.",

        "body":"The basic story is that a young Viking, from the North on the Island of Berk, who was keen on hunting trolls, gets his opportunity at an elusive dragon. When he confronts his Viking ways, he must decide for himself whether to dispatch his prey or will he come to an understanding of the true nature of the beast. If you own cats you can see the dilemma and the conflict. Not that any feline is in danger of being dispatched.There is nothing unique about this movie. The story is old as the hills. The animation while not intrusive to the message is not unique either. There are no new truths or insights or anything. The standard minus and a boy are coming of age with others attempting to do so also. It is refreshing to find the single-family parent is the father however it is the old single-parent family conflict. The one big flaw in the story is that the only dragon that could use befriending was targeted for dispatching by everyone including fellow dragons; what kind of message does that send? I have to admit I did not read the book so I cannot compare the book\/movie.On the positive side, they picked some good voices (see the DVD extras) for the individual characters. They did not constantly bombard the movie with unrelated background music. There attempt at cute contemporary dialog works pretty well. The dialog was not dummed down as most of the later Disney movies.For the technically inclined, I watched the Blu-ray version but not the 3D. Nothing against 3D, I just do have a fancy TV yet. The disk ran well in the Sony player. I did not try it in my other players.",

        "body":"I remember watching the adorable Disney flick Lilo & Stitch at the theater back in the summer of 2002, after a truly exhausting week. The film - which tells the story of a small girl that befriends a wacky alien she mistakes for a dog - managed to put an enormous smile on my face, and made me forget of all my other worries for a while.While watching Dreamwork's new masterpiece, How to Train Your Dragon, I couldn't help but think about the similarities between both it and the aforementioned Lilo & Stitch. Toothless, the lead dragon character from the new film resembles the alien Stitch in shape as well as in behavior. Hiccup, the main human character which befriends Toothless despite warnings from his fellow Vikings, is a semi middle-age teenage version of the character Lilo. A trip visit to IMDb cleared things up for me - Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, the same people who directed the 2002 wonder (L & S) are behind the new and awesome How to Train Your Dragon.Fortunately enough, the similarities end here, and this is not a carbon copy of that film - even though the bottom line (tolerance toward people who are different, etc.) is the same. However, this new film takes place in the middle ages, in a small village which is repeatedly attacked by seemingly vicious dragons. Stoick (voiced by the almighty Gerard Butler) is the head of the village, a pumped up manly Viking who leads the counter-attacks against the fierce dragons. His teenage son, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), however, doesn't quite fit in. Unlike the older Vikings, who speak in an Irish accent, he sounds like your average American teenager. He's also skinny and small and not exactly the material Viking warriors are made of.After a nightly battle between Vikings and dragons, Hiccup discovers Toothless, a supposedly lethal dragon, which has lost its ability to fly after being injured in the fight. Without anyone knowing, Hiccup slowly gains Toothless' confidence, and the two gradually learn to know each other. After the primal fears disappear, they realize they actually have a great deal to learn about one another – and that friendship is always better than hostility. Soon enough, Hiccup trains Toothless and learns how to approach dragons in general, something that doesn't quite fit in with his father, friends, and the society he lives in in general. But when a greater threat reveals itself, the Vikings and the dragons discover their only hope is to put aside their prejudice thoughts and fight together – with Hiccup and Toothless being their best hope for victory.Bottom line – How to Train Your Dragon is a major victory for the guys at Dreamworks. The film is truly inspiring, with a story that feels self-contained and complete, one that doesn't need to rely on pop culture references to succeed (unlike many of their other products). After a long period of mediocre products (in my opinion) that pale next to their Pixar counterparts, Dreamworks Animation finally came out with the winning formula – which contains just the right amount of relatable characters and true emotions, stunning visuals (including Nordic landscapes and various species of beautiful dragons) and a 3-D element (that uses InTru technology) that really works for a change.Despite the similarities to Lilo & Stitch, I came out feeling that Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders actually managed to improve on their winning hit, and create the best 2010 release I've seen so far – and one of the best animated films to hit theaters in a long long time.",

        "body":"2010 was a tough, tough year to rate films; so many excellent films, it remains the most memorable year for me. Inception won out, but even with Tron Legacy and Toy Story 3, How to Train your Dragon came a very, very tight second behind Christopher Nolan's mind-warping thriller. Even now... I question that choice: in my top 50 films of all, this film comes a solid 18th (one place higher than Inception).I adore this movie.In a fantastical land, warrior vikings battle dragons on a daily basis, but one viking Hiccup is not like the others; he is meek and sheltered and instead of battling he creates traps and gadgets, instantly becoming a laughing stock of his peers and a disgrace to his father. But when Hiccup wounds a mysterious new dragon and begins to form a friendship with the beast, his world is turned (sometimes literally) upside down!I remember the early posters for this film. I remember scoffing: \"Hmpf, How to Train your Dragon? Another lame animation full of crude humour from the studio that brought us Shrek? Count me out.\" But then the trailer appeared and wow. Then I watched it and I was floored. For a ninety minute feature it is crammed with story and great characterization! The dialogue first and foremost is witty and snappy but never overbearing or obnoxious (something a lot of animation suffers from at least a couple of times) this comes from having genuinely wonderful characters. Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel, probably now typecast for life) is not whiny or too hopeless, using intellect and unorthodox thinking to win out, and the film's core being the developing friendship between him and his dragon Toothless, which is both very powerful and fun to watch! I don't think I can forget their first scenes together on screen! Toothless, what can one say? Media has had a lot of great dragons in the past, Toothless is right up with the best of them! Somewhere between a dragon and a cat, his is intensely cute and fiercely loyal to Hiccup. They become like joshing best buddies. It doesn't stop there either, the supporting cast are excellent too. Gerald Butler gives a fantastic performance as Hiccup's father, the amazingly named Stoic the Vast (the father-and-son \"talk\" scene is actually one of my favourites) and even potential love interest Astrid (America Ferrera) isn't anywhere near two-dimensional.It isn't all fluffy cuteness either, the overarching story is intense; these vikings live to hunt and kill dragons, this is a war going on and at times How to Train Your Dragon does not pull any punches. There are some challenging, heart wrenching moments in the third act, and as such this film single-handed showed the world that Dreamworks Studios are capable of standing as tall (if not taller) than Disney and Pixar combined.The music is a soaring Celtic and orchestral mix, the graphics are often eye-popping (the sky and rock effects are incredible) and the animation on Toothless is to die for, the screenplay is tight and never wasteful and the dialogue is smart and refined.Dare I say it, nothing is wrong with this film!",

        "body":"For a decade now, Dreamworks has had to carry the uncomfortable burden of playing second fiddle to that animation behemoth, Pixar. If this was a family, Disney's Pixar would be the older, ambitious sister, the one always doted upon and destined for greatness, and Dreamworks would be her cruder but sometimes more entertaining brother. However, the rivalry between the two studios seems to be fodder for the media more than anything else. Instead of stewing in jealousy or attempting to outdo Pixar, Dreamworks opts to stay true to itself and to fashion its own path to success; in fact, the studio could act as the protagonist in one of its own movies. With movies like the Shrek franchise, Madagascar and Monsters vs. Aliens, Dreamworks tends to aim for entertainment rather than art, simplicity over depth and the funny bone over the brain. For the most part, their latest film, How to Train Your Dragon, stays faithful to this trend.Strongly reminiscent of the 1999 movie The Iron Giant, Dragon employs Dreamworks's most reliable formula: that of the misfit underdog who ultimately gets his chance to shine and learns a valuable lesson along the way, usually on the lines of the ever-popular \"be yourself\" mantra of most kids movies. Though The Iron Giant was superior overall, How to Train Your Dragon does possess a lot of the same earnestness and heart as that film. The scenes devoted to the emerging bond between Hiccup and Toothless are the best in the movie, and their relationship feels organic and natural instead of coming across as a corny plot device. Toothless in particular comes across almost immediately as likable and, in nature, resembles a puppy more than a ferocious dragon. In addition, the animation is very well-done throughout, and the flying scenes, especially one that recalls the \"A Whole New World\" magic carpet ride in Disney's Aladdin, are as realistic as any. I didn't find them quite as engrossing as those in Avatar, but I'm sure they would have benefited had I caught this movie in time to see it in 3D.Still, even with those pluses, it is difficult to overlook the movie's flaws. The plot is predictably predictable, which would not have been quite so bad if the secondary characters had not been reduced to mere stereotypes (the disapproving father who only wants what's best for his son, the overachieving girl who eventually falls for the hero despite herself, the bullies, the comical friend\/sidekick\/confidant). While the usual pop culture references are thankfully absent and there are a handful of sharp lines, much of the humor and dialogue feels tired and wooden; the mostly lackluster voice cast does little to help. Furthermore, the movie strives to explore Viking and Norse mythology, but despite occasional shout-outs to Odin and Thor, this is all largely rendered moot by the presence of Scottish accents when they are obviously supposed to reside in Scandinavia.It's hard to really hate Dreamworks, though. After all, in terms of bug movies, I preferred Antz to A Bug's Life, and though I'm probably in a minority here, Kung Fu Panda was infinitely more enjoyable than Wall-E, which, for all its technical mastery, felt like an artsy message movie masquerading as something more accessible and less preachy. In spite of its faults, How to Train Your Dragon was a pleasant enough movie and certainly surpasses some of the other fare we've been subjected to thus far this year. It's no Toy Story 3, but it is something kids will probably love. Adults might not mind it much either.",

His encounter with a dragon challenges him to see things from a different perspective and propels him to revolutionise his community. I find the premise - that human beings were wrong about the nature of dragons for centuries - not quite believable. To be fair, we have been wrong about many things in the course of history, but to be so wrong about a creature that you encounter on a very regular basis pushes the limits of believability.

Now that we are finished the bad things about this movie, lets get to the good things! This movie is the funniest film out of the Home Alone franchise, and I think most people will probably agree with me on that. Macaulay Culkin did really well, and so did everyone else in the main cast. This movie is almost as good as the original, (which is also 8\/10) but I\nI wish the story was a bit more original.",

On this occasion, little Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) goes in the middle of Christmas, with his family to the airport in order to enjoy a short Christmas vacation with the family, but he boards the wrong plane that takes him to New York, where he is again alone and unprotected. As if this were not enough, the boy meets Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marvin (Daniel Stern), the thieves from the last installment who escaped from prison, and they want to take revenge. Bring Home The Laughter This Holiday Season!. Holy cow!. Start spreading the news. Guess who's alone in New York this Christmas!. Another Christmas in the trenches. He's up past his bedtime in the city that never sleeps. Yikes! I did it again! First, he was home alone, now he's lost in New York When Kevin's family left for vacation, they forgot one minor detail: Kevin.Given the success achieved with the first installment, one of the most commercial films of all time, filmmakers John Hughes (as producer and screenwriter) and Chris Colombus, return in this second installment and first sequel, joining their efforts for this Christmas sequel to the film that made little Macaulay Culkin famous.This megahit produces funny gags, genuine laughs, violent jokes, amusement, entertainment and incorporating fresh material. It was a almost exact duplication of the original including cartoon violence. Boarding the wrong plane , troublemaker Kevin lands in NYC, where he meets crooks Pesci y Stern as prison escapees; not so much a sequel, more of an action replay but even more violent than the original. Macaulay Culkin is as adorable as ever with supporting cast all delivering fine interpretations. Although with an unlikely premise triggering the story, Kevin turns into a pint-sized Rambo defending himself with the resources and wile of a boy genius with a perfect timing and unlimited intelligence.Kevin's new Christmas adventures are supported by a much larger budget. Joining Culkin in the cast are Joe Pesci (Godfellas), Daniel Stern (A Place Called Miracle), Catherine O'Hara (Orange Country), John Heard (Awakenings). And Brenda Ficket (My Left Foot) and Tim Curry (The Rocky Horror Picture Show) join this fun saga too.The saga is formed by: ¨Home alone¨(1990) by Chris Colombus with Macaulay Culkin, Daniel Stern, Joe Pesci, John Heard, Robert Blosson, Billie Bird, Kieran Culkin, Devin Ratray, Kristin Minter. ¨Home alone: Lost in New York¨ (1992) Tim Curry, Brenda Fricker, Eddie Bracken, Rob Schneider, Dana Ivey, Catherine O'Hara, John Heard. ¨Home Alone 3¨ (1997) by Raja Gosnell (editor of the two previous films) with Alex D Linz taking over for the teenaged Culkin, Kevin Kilner, Olek Krupa, Lenny Van Dohlen, Haviland Morris, Scarlett Johansson; here some international criminals trying to recover a microchip stashed in a toy car that has the mistakenly left home alone Alex Linz, while attempting to foil their plans, this sequel fails to carry the charm of its predecessors.",

It does have a few new elements and a few new enjoyable characters and overall the Movie is still a festive fun filled family adventure and no doubt all the elements I have touched on which are direct copies from the first is what probably appeals to younger family members.

The only problem is that the jokes are basically retreads of the first movie, but believe me, they're miles better than the ones in the fourth ( which is one of the worst movies ever) This is still a very solid film, that gets slow in the second half. The performances are excellent. Macaulay Culkin brought a lot of charm to almost all the movies he's been in. Just a shame, he isn't acting any more. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious, as always. Catherine O'Hara and John heard are amiable as the parents, while the wonderful Tim Curry gives a hilarious performance as the Concierge. My favourite scenes were the bathroom scene in the hotel, and when the staff are held hostage by a television. Just priceless. Eddie Bracken and Brenda Fricker also make appearances, and their scenes are touching, as they are of friendship and acceptance. I absolutely adored the soundtrack too, New York looks splendid and the Plaza Hotel was incredible to look at. Brilliant movie! 9\/10. Bethany Cox",

It still has me constantly laughing 'till this day, I think if you loved the first Home Alone, I'm sure that you'll just naturally love this one as well. Not too many folks are just giving it a good chance. I mean, the Wet Bandants are back and they are just as funny as ever! I think this house that Kevin set up was actually in some ways a little more fun than the first because of the traps he was able to set. Not to mention the Plaza Hotel plot was so great and fun to watch.Kevin and his family are heading down to Florida for Christmas this year, but when Kevin gets mixed up at the air port and gets on the wrong flight, he ends up in New York. Instead of complaining or panicking, he just plain enjoys it. He goes on the ultimate tour with his father's bag of money and credit cards and cons himself into the Plaza Hotel claiming he's there with his dad. But the Wet Bandants who have now re-named themselves as the Sticky Bandants are in New York as well and are planning on stealing all the money from a toy store that is going to be given to the children's hospital. But Kevin is going to make sure that they don't mess around with the kids and has set his uncle's abandoned apartment up for a fun house of traps.Home Alone 2: Lost in New York was an absolute blast. The reason I'm giving it a ten is because I think the rating should be higher. People really need to give this movie a shot. My favorite scene is without a doubt when Marv gets hit in the face with the bricks, also, the scene where the Plaza Hotel managers are asked by Kevin's mom \"What kind of idiots do you have working here?!\"... the lady just smiles and says \"The finest in New York!\", it was just too funny! I love this movie and I'm always going to recommend it for a good watch, I think you'll enjoy it if you give it a chance.10\/10",

        "body":"There are different tastes in this film. Those who like the film say it is still fun, while those who dislike it say it is exactly the same as the previous film.The McAllisters, a large family, are planning a Christmas trip to Miami. They are almost late and in their haste, they leave Kevin at the airport as they did last year. Kevin follows someone dressed like his father and gets on a flight to New York. When Kevin arrives in New York, he checks into a hotel with his father's card and uses his wits and a voice recorder to cover up the fact that he is alone in New York.He goes to a toy store and meets a kindly old man. He tells us that \"Mr. Duncan\" is going to donate all the proceeds from this Eve to the hospital. When he leaves the store, he is caught by two thieves who once broke into Kevin's house. Kevin frames the two men for molestation. He manages to escape. He walks frightened through the eerie New York streets at night and meets a woman who is swarming with pigeons. At first he is afraid of her, but she saves him and he goes to the attic of a concert hall. After being advised to do something nice, Kevin decides to fight off the thieves and save the sick children and Mr. Duncan.It's a very long synopsis, but it can't be helped as there is a great deal of foreshadowing in the first half of the film. In my opinion, the blatant storyline is saved by the action and new elements.As bad as 3 was, Macaulay Culkin will prove to be very important to Home Alone. His sly Kevin character is delightful and funny. He may be a little less funny in 2, but that is saved by the hilarious characterizations around him.Also, while closer to comedy than action, the thief being taken advantage of by the kid is overtly funny, and while it's not fresh since we saw a smattering of it last time, I still felt the idea still somewhat worked. We think one factor is that, unlike last time, the majority of the film is not invaded by this comedy.The new additions to the story are also pleasing to us. I will tell those who criticize us for repainting the previous film by increasing the scale of violence and location, but it is not only the violence that has increased. I don't know if this will satisfy you, but there is some humor in Kevin relaxing gracefully in the hotel. Also, the increased characterization makes it more interesting.Minor changes are made: more violence and characters, moving the location to New York City, and changing the taste of the story. And the all-important humor is recycled!!! -- The idea that this will fool the audience is obvious. We know this. But we still love Home Alone, its characters, and its humor, so we are fooled even though we know it.",

A part drama\/part cartoon is not going to work. You can't, for example, make a scene with a little kid having a touching conversation with a lonely homeless woman and immediately follow it up with wacky cartoon antics. When you do that, your movie stops being funny and becomes extremely disturbing.In the first \"Home Alone,\" Kevin only seemed interested in maiming the villains; in this one he is apparently trying to kill them. Case in point: the scene where he is throwing bricks at Marv's head. Not dropping them, but actually THROWING them at the guy's face. From this point on Kevin turns into some sort of demon child on par with the kid from \"Pet Sematary\" as he tries burning, electrocuting, and cracking open the skulls of his victims while shouting things like, \"Nice night for a neck injury!\" (He actually says that). The thought of a theater full of young children laughing at two men being brutally tortured for half an hour really creeps me out.The only possible reason to watch this is for Tim Curry, one of the world's greatest actors and who steals every scene he's in, but otherwise it's a waste of time.",

While the plot fails to be as engaging as the original, a big asset is all of the New York location photography that gives us great glimpses of the big city for an added dose of realism.It starts out pretty much the way the original did, with the family planning a Florida vacation and with Kevin pursuing all of them as they make a mad dash through the airport. This time, he doesn't deliberately stay behind--he mistakenly believes he's following a man wearing a coat similar to his father.But what's really missing are the characters that made HOME ALONE such a treat--and they aren't topped by the bird lady sequence and her friendship with the boy, nor are the bungling exploits of bad guys JOE PESCI and DANIEL STERN as funny, even though they are as clueless as ever in trying to deal with Culkin's nasty pranks.The violence employed by Culkin gets even nastier this time, which turns out to be a drawback because, after all, this isn't a cartoon where we know no one is really getting hurt.But in general, the story moves swiftly, the parents' reaction to discovering that he's lost is just as funny (as is their encounter with an official while trying to explain the situation), and the supporting cast does their best to keep things lively. Nice to see EDDIE BRACKEN as a toy store mogul in a huge toy store where a key scene takes place.Fans of HOME ALONE will no doubt appreciate this sequel, but they aren't likely to be as fond of it as the original--which had a wistful sort of charm totally lacking here. John Williams' score is a pleasing asset, once again providing a sprightly backdground that gives the film added cheer.",

        "body":"Macaulay Culkin – one of the most famous child stars since Shirley Temple – returns as Kevin McAllister in the 1992 nostalgic and sentimental slapstick Christmas classic that has not dated since its original release.As the sequel of the highest grossing comedy of all time, Home Alone 2 is one of the biggest Christmas films of the 90s. Along with its predecessor, the story is all about Christmas. While the familiar Christmas vacation is shown as chaotic and stressful, it is the essential family element that brings us back to the films main themes of togetherness and (paradoxically) independence.Becoming separated from his family once again when leaving for a Christmas holiday, Kevin is left alone to his own devices, this time in New York City and causes chaos and mayhem when he bumps into the freshly escaped \"Wet Bandits\", who are once again, out to get him.The original cast return with Culkin in the lead, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the hilariously dumb, yet slightly endearing criminals with a heart of coal and the fantastic Catherine O'Hara as the mum every child wants, played with just the right amount of fear, guilt, determination and love that is needed. Another noteworthy return is the sequel of gangster spoof Angels with Filthy Souls, Angels with Even Filthier Souls (a reminiscent construction of Angels with Dirty Faces with James Cagney.) New characters are brought to life by Tim Curry, Brenda Fricker, Eddie Bracken, Dana Ivey and a young Rob Schneider.Film critics such as Roger Ebert gave the film negative reviews and saw it as portraying violence as too cartoonish. Despite this fact, the mainstream popularity of the film saw it as a success and to most children of the 90s, the second instalment in the Home Alone series is often seen as equal in quality if not better than the first.This film has been monumental in my life. I cannot remember how I first saw it, but I know that thanks to VHS I watched it a million times. It formed my quintessential idea of New York by using Central Park, Carnegie Hall and the Plaza Hotel as central plot settings. It is as much a Christmas film as it is a New York City film and this familiar touristy promotion shows New York as being a unique \"White Christmas\" town.So in the cheery Christmas words of Johnny the Crook from Angels: Merry Christmas you filthy animaland a Happy New Year.",

I get that McCauley Culkin's goofy grin, floppy hair, big ears plus of course that scream of his might irritate some but I otherwise found all these plus his smartness and rebelliousness quite acceptable.I enjoyed the way the writer and director, knowing that this is a sequel bound to end up with the same slap-sticky, booby-trapped conclusion as its mega-successful predecessor found a clever and even credible way to separate Kevin again from his family. I loved the New York winter locations while on the acting side, I equally enjoyed the cameo as toy-store owner Mr Duncan by veteran Eddie Bracken, who starred in so many great Preston Sturges films of the 40's. John Williams also delivers a playful soundtrack in keeping with the frivolities depicted on the screen.In these and other ways, director Chris Columbus harks back to those Golden Age Hollywood days, not by coincidence is \"It's A Wonderful Life\" referenced again in one of his movies, but here too he contributes a lasting seasonal classic which I dare say will likewise be watched and enjoyed by families at Yule time down the years.",

        "body":"Too many sequels suffer from Deja Vu, and hardly any of those carbon copies improve upon the original. Home Alone 2 is a carbon copy, but it's also much better and more complex a movie than the first. In another mad rush to the airport the McCallisters make a point of remembering Kevin this time, but he gets lost in a crowd at the airport and follows a man who looks like his dad onto the wrong plane. Thirteen of the McCallisters are going to Miami for Xmas (do they never stay at home?) but Kevin is headed for the Big Apple, and he's going to have that once-in-a-lifetime vacation he's been wishing for.There's much more for Kevin to see and do in New York. He scams his way into the Plaza hotel where a suspicious Concierge (Tim Curry) gives him mighty evil looks at every encounter. He goes to Duncan's Toy Chest, the biggest toy store in town and takes many scenic photographs. Though it is a little unnerving now seeing Kevin on the roof of the World Trade Centre.But the Wet Bandits have escaped, and they have just arrived in New York with loftier ambitions and bigger heists to pull off. They even brush by Kevin a few times not knowing he's there. Typically though, once they get a hold of him the give away far too much info. Once Kevin escapes he takes matters into his own hands once more. His Aunt Georgette from the first movie is still in Paris so he uses her half-renovated home as a huge mousetrap for the bungling burglars.The booby traps this time are much more painful and nasty, so it's all the more amusing for us. Who can possibly fail to laugh at Marv getting the shock of his life when he tries to turn on the taps? If the movie were to be released now I doubt if it would be let away with a PG rating. Still, it's nothing for any parents to worry about. Unless you fear your child is going to set your head on fire with a blowtorch.Home Alone 2 has a more satisfying climax than the first. The film doesn't simply end once Harry and Marv are back in the slammer as there is more plot to it than that. Brenda Fricker has a (rather questionable) role as 'The Pigeon Lady' a woman who lives in Central Park and talks to no one-until Kevin reaches out. Plus Eddie Bracken shows up as Mr. Duncan and gives Kevin the best Christmas morning ever as a token of his appreciation.With a bigger story (okay, some of it re-used) and more characters and a better playground for Kevin, Home Alone 2 manages to be a superior sequel. While not excessively so. There's loads of fun to be had in Kevin's antics, and Tim Curry is downright brilliant as the mischievous Concierge.It's a great movie on it's own but sadly it will always be called a copycat. Watch it now from a fresh perspective and you might like it more.",

The movie follows faithfully the tried and tested method that brought huge success to the original, meaning that anyone who enjoyed the first movie should find this equally entertaining.Despite the obvious similarities between the two movies, there are a couple of important additions that differentiate them and should satisfy any skeptic viewers.

Now alone in the Big Apple, Kevin cons his way into a room at the Plaza Hotel and begins his usual antics. But when Kevin discovers that the Sticky Bandits (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) are on the loose, he struggles to stop them from robbing an elderly man's toy store just before Christmas.None of the charm that made the original so much fun is even present here. This is a sub-par sequel that had no heart and no soul. It was a money grab. Overtime the film has fallen out of public's eye.

        "body":"When you watch this film for the first time, you can ask yourself this question \"was it useful to make a sequel to one of the most successful films made in 1990?\". The answer is obviously not. The only interest of the film is commercial. Indeed, John Hughes and Chris Colombus felt like renewing with the huge success of \"Home Alone\". Although this film was average, it was quite funny but, here, its sequel is very poor and disappointing. The film takes back too many elements from the first and as a consequence, it doesn't create surprises any more. For example, when Kevin is at the Plaza Hotel, he's watching, apparently, a detective film, and we know that the man, in the film, will kill the young lady as it was the case in Home Alone with the two men on the video. On the other hand, Kevin's weird neighbour was considered a slayer for a long time; but then Kevin found out that he was an unhappy man. In the film, a tall woman who brings up pigeons took the place of Kevin's neighbour and like this man, she's apparently threatening, but then again, like the man, she had a miserable life. So the film is deprived of originality. Moreover, the screenplay is always predictable and sometimes it's unlikely: Kevin's traps are more dangerous than in the previous film and however the two burglars don't seem to suffer a lot. At last Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci aren't very funny, Stern is even ridiculous and dumb. In 1997, a third sequel was made but with a different actor instead of Macaulay Culkin in the main role. Let's hope, there won't be a fourth.",

Things like Kevin's supposed stories getting him access to a plane to New York and entry to an expensive hotel room. Then his family's insult to Florida with their supposed bad experience. For crying out loud, they whine about being stuck inside the hotel because of the rain in Florida, yet I hate to tell you this, but snow (which they seem to like) is simply frozen rain. Then, while they're still in Florida, Kevin can get things for himself by simply telling people stupid stories, and out of nowhere he has just what he needs to torture the hotel workers and the criminals.It gets especially bad when he makes the remodeling house of his relatives the center of torture for the same criminals. The scenario is a lot like and maybe even worse than the original movie; he nearly does enough to murder the criminals and things that could possibly destroy the entire house itself.Although I did like the characters like the Pigeon Lady and Mr. Duncan from the toy store, but that was about it. The scenarios with things like Kevin's tricks on the hotel employees (things that would hopefully get police called), alongside his supposed brilliant catch of the criminals using his torture. Note, after all of this he actually does call the police effortlessly. The whole movie is, for the most part, unbelievable and dumb as well",

It's a shame to see great actors like Catherine O'Hara and Joe Pesci reduced to this.Culkin is still very cute and likeable but his character is so unbelievably corny in this movie that it makes some of his scenes painful to watch. Many of his lines feel like they were taken from a cheap self-help book or a fortune cookie. His scenes with Marley in the original were moving and authentic; his scenes with Brenda Fricker aka Pigeon Lady are just forced and contrived. Speaking of Pigeon Lady, surely they could have at least tried to make her resemble an actual homeless person? She looks like a well-fed piano teacher from Surrey.I really wish I hadn't watched this movie; it's such a shame when these dreadful sequels take the gloss off a great film.

It doesn't take long for him to run into Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) who plan on robbing a toy store for some charity cash. It's funny but growing up I always thought HOME ALONE 2 was better than the original but revisiting it after all these years has me changing my mind. I was really surprised to see how this one didn't quite hold up as well as the original and I think a lot of it has to do with some pretty big errors with the screenplay. Needless to say, the main reason for this thing being made was because the first was such a massive hit. You can expect this type of sequel to be pretty much a remake as everything funny in the first film is copied here. This includes the old gangster movie with the gun, the various knocks and beatings taken by the crooks and of course the \"true\" meaning of family. All of that stuff here is still funny but it just doesn't come close to what the original offered. The biggest problem with HOME ALONE 2 is its running time, which is just way too long for this film and after a while you're really wishing that it would hurry up and end. Still, there's no question that Culkin is just wonderful here in the role that he will always be remembered for. Both Pesci and Stern are fun as the bad guys and we get nice support from Catherine O'Hara and John Heard who have to be the worst parents in screen history. Tim Curry is also fun in his small role.",

From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed.

Whilst out exploring, the recently released Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern bump into him and decide to exact their revenge - not before telling him of their daring plan to rob a toy store. Of course he escapes their clutches, and quickly decides to try to thwart their thievery - as only he can. Curry is on good form here, as is just about everyone else as the slapstick hits overdrive and the paint pots, a nail gun and even an old cannon find innovative new uses. It is a good team effort, this - with plenty of gentle humour and amusing antics. Maybe just a bit too long, the joke starts to wear a bit thin but Chris Columbus has built well on the first film, with just enough variation from that one whilst essentially keeping the story the same.",

I know you have to sometimes suspend belief while watching movie, but this is too much! Anyway, not a bad film, just not very original and believable. I think the McAllisters just decided to spend all their Christmases at home after this, thank goodness!",

        "body":"This is another of those sequels that... suffer(?)... from a not entirely uncommon illness, known as \"The T2 Syndrome\". Terminator 2 may not be the origin of said illness, or even the first film to fall victim of it, but it is commonly accepted as the first recorded case of it. The syndrome renders any sequel as more of a remake of the first than an actual sequel, but the quality is a variable, it can go either way(or nowhere at all). Usually, everything in the film is kicked up a notch, higher production value, more action and more entertainment... sometimes signifying a higher budget. These films are often a desperate attempt by the film-makers to re-create the success of the first without breaking new ground or showing any originality or creativity. For whatever curiosity value it may hold; Charlies Angels: Full Throttle is another victim. As a victim of this illness, the film contains scene after scene(in fact, it's put together by them, it consists entirely of them) that are mild re-writes of scenes from the first. The plot is basically the same, and at best, fairly interesting. The minor lift the film has received in content, the fact that everything is just slightly 'more' than it was in the first makes for a few entertaining scenes scattered throughout the film(good thing, because without them, the film is barely worth watching at all). Apart from the entire original cast(well, the foundation, at least; the McCallister clan is back) returning for this sequel, we are also joined by the comedic talents of Rob Schneider, Tim Curry and Dana Ivey(I know, I know, but think of how she was in the Addams Family films, seriously), which pays off big time. The pacing is fine. The acting is mostly goofy and overplayed, which I suppose is the idea. The humor works, on occasion. There is one thing I just have to say; I don't much mind the silly humor of most of the film, but at the end... when it turns to slap-stick, Looney Tunes-like humor... that was just too much. It was bad in the first, this time, it's worse. I could barely watch. I found myself turning away again and again, taking longer and longer to look back at the screen. The content disgusted me. This is coming from a man who, in the last week, has seen Dawn of the Dead, Saw and Hellraiser: Hellseeker... during which, I never turned away, or, for that matter, regretted that I hadn't. The tone is just too much in this film, during those last scenes. I don't know what disturbs me more; the fact that I, myself, as a child, enjoyed these scenes. The fact that as I write this, there are children enjoying them. Or the fact that there are grown people... not only enjoying watching them, but thinking that it's OK, that it's OK to put that in (children's) films, to tell children that it's OK. That it's responsible. That children may, or even(*shudder*) should think that. It disturbs me. Quite a lot, in fact. That aside, the film does a nice job, through cinematography and dialog, to show the world as seen by a young child... of course, that only makes aforementioned fact even worse. I only recommend this film for people studying films, so they can analyze and debate it, get into the frame of mind behind this film, understand it. Anyone else watching it should take great care to understand that it is, in fact, fiction, and has very, very little to do with reality. I wouldn't consider this proper viewing for kids, unless these are very mature and understand that it's not real. 6\/10",

        "body":"\"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York\" was apparently conceived when Macaulay Calkin said he wouldnt relocate from his NYC home to Chicago. So, whilst the Windy City (and particularly the affluent suburb of Winnetka) appears fleetingly at the start, most of the film's action takes place in the Big Apple, and that is a pretty large canvas for Kevin McAlister to work with when - shock horror - he is separated from his family, getting onto a plane to New York when the rest of the McAlister clan went to Miami, and - shock horror again - Marv and Harry, the Wet Bandits from the first film, escape from prison and find themselves there as well. Of course they run into Kevin, who threatens to ruin their latest plan to make a big buck.Showcasing pretty much every iconic New York City location, Home Alone 2 features plenty of laughs (the hotel 'Angels with Filthy Souls' scene is great), a Donald Trump cameo in the Plaza Hotel, tonnes of comedic violence and, as a counterpoint to said violence, a sentimental ending, all set to a brilliant score from the maestro John Williams. \"Somewhere in my Memory\" is an iconic piece of movie music, and never fails to make me think of my own ghosts of Christmas past. A fun slice of 90's nostalgia that is still a fun watch thirty years (!!) on.Love this. Always will.",

They even got up late again and were scurrying out of the house! It was a regular act of laziness on the part of Hollywood.

        "body":"This movie takes everything in the original, and does it better. It takes many of the exact same beats from the first movie, and does them again, which most people seem to dislike, however, I disagree. With the exception of the pigeon lady, (who is pretty good, but really does just feel like a rehash of the shovel guy) all of the repeated elements are done with variation, and are improved in quality. The fake movie in this is funnier than the one in the first, the whole \"I'm a kid and I'll have fun doing irresponsible stuff\" aspect is done better thanks to the setting. And the humor is generally better. Maybe a lot is redone in this movie, but it's a winning formula, who cares? The pacing is also drastically improved. The first Home Alone is good, and I'm not saying that the first chunk of that movie is boring, but even with the comedic and other ways entertaining aspects, it still feels like you're just waiting through the movie to get to the trap sequence. However, in Home Alone 2, it feels like every scene is entertaining, and the trap sequence is just a cherry on top. Speaking of, the trap sequence is really good in this movie too. I don't understand why so many think this is a \"rushed sequel\" when they've presumably watched the whole movie all the way through. What I'm saying is, or, my point is, Marv getting electrocuted is absolutely hilarious and is the best example of slapstick comedy I have ever seen, seriously, rewatch it and tell me this isn't a good sequel. I don't know, I'm a bad reviewer, and this review is all over the place, but just please, please rewatch this movie and really give it a chance. Really see it as a movie, don't go into it expecting to hate it, just try to enjoy it, and you will. Or maybe not, who knows. I'm rambling, this review is over.",

Just like with Jaws and the countless other movies that only had sequels because of greed of hollywood.So here we have the same awful McCallister family, they treat Kevin like crap again , his cousins are the most disgusting bunch of mean spirited people even worse than the first movie . And why does the father keep inviting his mooching useless ahole of a brother along , the guy pays for nothing and yells and threatens Kevin at every turn. I mean , the father is paying for not only his own familys trip but his cousins and inlaws. The y are all a bunch of useless mean spitited people who care nothing about anyone but themselves. They insult Kevin ,call him names and at the end of the movie , do they care about Kevin no. Buzz blames Kevin for everyting that happens when it was the familes fault ,I mean after they all get on the place to Florida ,wouldnt they notice that Kevin was not on the plane with the other kids. And for that matter , Buzz causes most of the grief when he gets Kevin in trouble before they even go on the trip. It just makes me sick to watch his family onscreen . The first time I saw this movie ,I was hoping that someone anyone would give Kevins family an earful and tell them what an awful bunch of people they are and punch that deadbeat Uncle in the mouth.",

        "body":"Part of me was interested in seeing 'The Grinch', being a fan of the original Dr Seuss story and especially the 1966 animated version with Boris Karloff voicing Grinch (do like the Jim Carrey version better than most) and being someone who likes Benedict Cumberbatch and a lot of what he's done. Was nervous though too because the trailer did not look good, the reviews are mixed to not great and did question whether it was necessary.Dr Seuss adaptations have been very hit and miss. The animated short television specials have fared significantly better than the feature films, Dr Seuss' work lends itself better to adaptations of a short length and the television specials were not only great adaptations and true in detail and spirit but great on their own. Of the feature films, the best one is by far 'Horton Hears a Who' with the worst being the live action 'The Cat in the Hat' (to me among the worst films ever made). Illumination has also been variable, loved the first two 'Despicable Me' films while not caring for 'Minions'.Saw 'The Grinch' anyway as someone trying to see and review as many 2018 films as possible and loving the story and Christmas films, also to see how Cumberbatch would fare as Grinch. Seeing it, it is nowhere near as good as the 1966 version and is neither a Christmas cracker or a bah humbug. It is also neither among the best or worst films of the year, somewhere in the middle for me.There are definitely great things here. The animation cannot be faulted, so much gorgeous and meticulous attention to detail and rich vibrant colours that really immerses one into the world of Whoville. Some of the soundtrack has a festive and infectious feel. There are funny and emotional moments, the former with the funny and adorable (plus more interesting) Max and the latter with the Cindy Lou subplot, that and the character herself being the sweet and charming heart of the film.It is not a film without soul, having a warm glow more than once and some spirited elaborate set pieces, it does well with sticking to the spirit of the story and with the back and forth between Mount Crumpet and Whoville. It is not too long and has a lively pace generally. As said, Max and Cindy Lou are the best characters. Mostly the voice acting is good, with Cameron Seely being the clear standout.Having said all of this, 'The Grinch' could have been better. It does offer very little new or fresh, trying to be faithful to the source material while not moving enough beyond that that it all feels too safe. It could have done with more humour and heart generally, could have done without the repetitive and tired screaming goat gag and outside of the Cindy Lou subplot soul is missing.Found myself mixed on the pretty unrecognisable Cumberbatch. He does well providing a curmudgeonly touch and has moments of grinchy- meanness, plaudits too for not making Grinch too scary or resorting to excessive mugging. Do feel though that he was not mean or Grinchy-enough and he would have fared much better using his own voice for the character which would have fitted better. Had a big issue with the annoying, intrusive and over-explanatory narration that was not always necessary and with a rather out of place Pharrell Williams. Other parts of the soundtrack grated and too reminiscent of commercial music neither catchy or to my taste that didn't gel with the setting or the rest of the film. Too many of the supporting characters are forgettable and one-dimensional.Overall, better than what the critics have generally said but was rather mixed on a film with a lot of great merits but feels too safe and one does question the point of it. 6\/10 Bethany Cox",

        "body":"I know this will upset some folks, but the 2000 version of Dr. Seuss' classic, \"How The Grinch Stole Christmas\" was an abomination. First, the entire message of the original story was lost...and was, in fact, the opposite of Seuss' story. Second, the story was all about Jim Carrey and his mugging for the camera....everything else seemed secondary. Because of this, I was terribly disappointed, as I loved the original story and the great 1966 cartoon. Because of this, I was very reticent to watch this 2018 incarnation. But, in hindsight, my fears about the latest film are mostly unfounded.Because the film is about an hour and a half long, I already realized that the story had to be padded and include some new material...this is just inevitable. However, I was surprised how much I liked this material...such as the Grinch's cute reindeer. It was very pleasant and all contributed to the story instead of distracting from it. And, as far as the story goes, it stuck pretty close to the book--even using many exact quotes from the classic tale.As far as the quality of the film goes, it's a mixed bag but mostly good. The animation was eye-popping and wonderful. It really is great on the big screen and the 3-D effects were magnificent. I also liked that they made the Grinch a hater of Christmas but NOT a hateful or evil character. He was kinder and more sweet at times....even though he hated the holiday. The only things I wasn't thrilled about were the narration by John Legend and the voicework for the Grinch himself by Benedict Cumberbatch. I had the distinct impression that BOTH were used simply because the studio could get them--not because they were appropriate for the film. Legend is apparently a nice guy...but his nice-guy voice wasn't what you'd want or expect from a narrator. The same for Cumberbatch--who DID sound very different from his usual English accented voice but still was too 'normal' a voice for a character such as the Grinch.Overall, despite my voice talent complaint, the film is a great family film...one that honors the book and 1966 film instead of ignoring it like the 2000 incarnation. Well worth seeing and amazingly heartwarming...especially at the end as well as when the Grinch is interacting with his dog and pet reindeer.",

Can you imagine the uproar if the Grinch was an actual, you know, Grinch?Benedict Cumberbatch ditches his accent to voice the Christmas-hating heel, who lives in a cave by himself high above Whoville. Cumberbatch's reading is rather sanitized; if directors Yarrow Cheney and Scott Mosier didn't want a British Grinch, Cumberbatch was a curious choice.The holiday season is fast approaching, and ol' Grinchy is forced to go into Whoville and interact with its cheery inhabitants, who are preparing for a Christmas celebration that promises to be three times larger than the average holiday blowout. The Grinch - aided by his trusty dog Max - devises a scheme to rob the residents of Whoville of all their Christmas bounty while dressed as Santa Claus, until his plan is foiled by young Cindy Lou Who (voiced by Cameron Seely), who puts a little love back in the Grinch's rotten, decrepit heart.You know the story, and \"The Grinch\" wisely sticks to the basics without modernizing the details (the Grinch doesn't suddenly have an Instagram account) or greatly altering the structure. The 2000 version spent a good deal of time diving into the Grinch's backstory, making him a victim of childhood bullying; that's gone here. And since the original book runs just 69 pages, \"The Grinch\" doesn't stretch for material, and wraps in a concise 86 minutes.Pharrell Williams narrates the story, but doesn't have much flavor in his phrasing; somewhere, there's a voice actor cursing the day celebrities took over the voiceover field.Illumination Entertainment, responsible for the \"Despicable Me\" movies and \"The Secret Life of Pets,\" is in charge here, and gives the film a brightly lit, visually appealing aesthetic.\"The Grinch\" doesn't reinvent the story of the Grinch, nor does it top the crudely drawn charms of the original TV version. (It's tough to beat Boris Karloff's Grinch, and Cumberbatch doesn't put up much of a fight.) But by the end it opens it arms and spreads a fair amount of holiday cheer, which is obvious to even those whose hearts are two sizes too small.",

It doesn't go well and he comes up with the idea to ruin Christmas by impersonating Santa Claus. Meanwhile, Cindy Lou Who needs to talk to Santa about her wish. She recruits her friends to catch Santa.The 1966 special is perfect. This movie tries to improve on it by expanding on the story. It's a fool's errand. It could never improve on perfection. I actually don't mind the expansion in general. There are two big no-nos. The Whos look way too human and where are their antennas? They're just people with tiny noses. If the Whos are humans, then make Grinch a human and make this a live action movie. I wouldn't recommend it but at least, that could be interesting. This movie tries to be too modern. It needs to get rid of the electronics. The Whos exist in a specific world and the closer it gets to the modern world, the worst the visual content gets. The Whos have a certain style. At some point, it's no longer Dr. Seuss. At least, it's short. As for the voice work, the original had the greatness of Boris Karloff and the iconic song with Thurl Ravenscroft. These are iconic voices like Darth Vader. It doesn't get better than the best. Now it can be argued that Karloff was not the Grinch but rather the narrator reading the Grinch's dialogue. He's still the voice of the Grinch to me and Cumberbatch is doing something less compelling. I can see how the voice fits the character but it comes off weakly. Cindy Lou Who is older which is fine but the Whos sound too modern. They lack the wide eyed innocence that is inherent in their world. Nobody is evil but there is a stress in some of them especially the mom. Finally, there is the Grinch underwear. I get the joke but I'm conflicted about the results. Overall, this is an impossible job. Unless the filmmaker is willing to take unhealthy risks, it could never achieve much more than this movie. It's fine but this will be soon forgotten.",

I think the story is so timeless and characters so rich that just the fact that it's The Grinch is enough to satisfy. But for me, an adult that actually enjoyed Jim Carey's over the top movie, and of course the universally loved magnificent Chuck Jones version, I just thought this was dull. Very few laughs (although certainly some), nothing new visually, no real imagination. The opening was the best part, as The Grinch wakes and dresses in a fun way. But after that, just kinda of cruises along, one pop song after another.The animation however, is truly fabulous. Looks amazing, bright and colorful and beautiful. Max the dog is cute. The snow really crunched and you can feel the cold.It's been said so often that it's hardly worth saying again - but why remake something and not significantly change it, offering something new to the story? How about setting the story after The Grinch steals Christmas instead of retelling exactly the story we've already seen and enjoyed? Just doesn't make sense to me.",

All the films and just for the fact that it is a Christmas movie that isn't all the same as the others. I came into this film excited because I really enjoy Benedict Cumberbatch as an actor and figured he would do a great job as the Grinch. To keep it short, he does a great job as the Grinch. This movie was different from what I expected though. The Whos when the Grinch would visit weren't in fear of the Grinch. They didn't avoid him, there are characters that openly try to embrace the Grinch. While the story of the movie has this tone makes sense, it was weird throughout seeing this. The best part of the film is Max. He is the character that helped me enjoy this movie. The bonding between Grinch and Max is adorable especially if you have a pupper at home. The Whos really take back seat in this film and that was fine because they really didn't enhance it much for me outside of a singular character and a few scenes. This is not a bad movie, I just don't think it is necessary for theaters. If you love the Grinch, I recommend a viewing but with movies like Overlord, Widows, and Girl in the Spiders Web, I feel that your experience could be better served if you're more excited for those films.TL;DR- This Grinch is the least grinchy of them all. Max and the animal pals make the movie fun to sit through because they are adorable. If you love the Grinch, I'd say see this but if you're excited for other movies this week and next, save your cash and see those.",

Now, Benedict Cumberbatch voices him in computer animation by Illumination Entertainment, makers of the Despicable Me movies. It admirably changes some things and adds some other characters in expanding the story.

        "body":"Illumination is a studio known for producing gutless, boring, paint-by-numbers, mass appeal movies that focus more on cute gimmicks and marketing than they do on actual storytelling and character development. If you've seen anything else from Illumination, you practically don't need to see this movie, because you can probably just predict every scene in your head and just about get it right. While The Grinch isn't Illumination's worst, it's still a thoughtless and emotionless product only meant to sell toys and theater tickets before charm and charisma.Benedict Cumberbatch's Grinch is boring. I do like Cumberbatch and I did think he'd be great to voice the Grinch, but he's terrible in this movie. His voice doesn't match the character whatsoever, and does nothing to bring the character more to life. At least Jim Carrey put energy and emotion into his performance, whereas Cumberbatch sounds like he's disappointed about the small paycheck he's just been given. The Grinch himself is written in a way that pulls all punches and has to cave in to cutesy kids logic instead of a clever way that tells a good story. Instead of making The Grinch actually funny or interesting, they make him the typical 2018 grumpy hipster who's a good guy at heart but just needs his morning coffee. Making him a mostly good character really undermines the climactic payoff of him finally understanding the meaning Christmas towards the end.Sadly, both the character and the overall movie as a whole share the same problems; it's boring, uninspired, and vanilla. Much like the character, the movie sucks out anything interesting in favor for playing it safe and selling toys. The music is even done by rapper Tyler The Creator, and even as a moderate fan of his work, the music here is terribly uninspired and obviously an attempt to make the film more hip. Most of the jokes are entirely predictable. Actually, the entire movie is predictable. I don't mean we've seen the original movies, I mean the film follows every generic story you'll ever see in a kids movie. The film feels more like it was written by a computer and less like a team of engrossed screenwriters. One of the film's running gags is the ex-popular 'screaming goat' meme...seriously, I thought that meme stopped being funny in 2013.Truthfully, this film is not the worst thing to come out of Illumination. It may not be a good movie, but at least it doesn't completely bastardize and miseducate its message like The Lorax did, and at least it isn't as excruciatingly for-the-masses as Minions or The Secret Life Of Pets. The Grinch, as well as every single other Illumination Studios movie, is like a cute untamed puppy; it may urinate on your rug and chew up all of your shoes, but it's cute and looks at you with big puppy dog eyes and does silly things, so you don't punish it and let it slide when it really shouldn't be forgiven so easily. When are we as an audience going to stop letting these thoughtless movies slide solely because of their cuteness? Regardless, moms and kids alike will continue to enjoy these movies without the slightest care, simply because it's cute and nothing more.",

However, Benedict Cumberbatch is wasted in this movie (indeed any nasal toned American actor would have done as well), Pharrell Williams offers up some lame rhyming narration that doesn't come close to the excellence of Dr. Suess' craft.

I was puzzled by the posters, which showed not the Dr. Seuss Grinch, who looks like he's made out of terry cloth, but a cute and fluffy version.That's pretty representative. While the original Grinch was motivated by an inexplicable malevolence, this Grinch is more like an irritable guy who yells at kids to get off his lawn. It's a sort of Jon Lovitz version, although weirdly enough he's voiced by Benedict Cumberthatch, whose own posh, sardonic voice would have been more appropriate.Turning Cindy Lou Who from a quiet 2 year old to a rambunctious 10 is also an odd choice, but admittedly you have to find *some* way to get a full movie out of the slight story, and if you put the original out of your head I guess its fine.There are some clever bits, the animation is good, and I like the idea of Grinch as an ingenious inventor, which allows for some fun creativity in the enterprise. But it's vastly inferior to the amazing original cartoon short from Chuck Jones, and if you can't at least get close to that, what's the point?Perfectly watchable, kind of cute, but not a valuable addition to the list of Seuss adaptations.",

The Grinch in particular is a really bad choice. There is no evil darkness to the grinch and a voice like Boris Karloff was a necessary component. Pharrell was not the best choice for narration and I'm a huge fan. Hits outweigh the misses, it's a fun update, and you can still watch the original too.",

Many great scenes just by the animation alone and the story was your typical Grinch story so that's not anything surprising.\nThe dog having been upgraded big time to more of a 2nd character instead of a door mat was a welcomed addition.The bad... many of the voices seemed very off, lacking personality.\nThe Grinch being the cutest character could be seen as a negative because I'm rooting for him more so than town of characters. I could have watched him go on his own adventure honestly with the dog.\nThe Narrator's voice is easily the biggest, and possibly most disgusting mistake in any animated movie I can think of besides Daisy in Secret Life of Pets. The voice should fit the tone of the movie and the narrator's lack of emphasis on any word EVER is extremely annoying and loses a few points just for that. I'd rather Keenan Thompson had done the narration instead of playing an actual character. He actually put some emotion in his character. You can't just READ a script.

The Grinch(Benedict Cumberbatch) hatches a sinister plan to steal Christmas, from the citizens of Whoville.Dr. Seuss' The Grinch is an awesome film. Directors Yarrow Cheney & Scott Mosier have given us an entertaining movie, that shows its protagonist in a more empathetic light that previous adaptations. The animation is fantastic. The ending will melt your heart. One flaw of this film is that, it is not as hilarious as so many other animated movies. The vocal performances of the cast, are the highlight of the film. Benedict Cumberbatch is spectacular as The Grinch. Cameron Seely is outstanding as Cindy-Lou Who. Rashida Jones is amazing as Donna Who. Pharrell Williams is superb as the Narrator. Tristan O'Hare is adorable as Groopert. Kenan Thompson is excellent as Mr. Bricklebaum. Dr. Seuss' The Grinch is not a must watch. However, it is worth watching with the full family, during Christmas season. Have a merry & Grinch-y Christmas!",

        "body":"This is another film by illumination animation, a company known for their very cheap animation, generic cookie cutter plots, low brow humor, Pop music, and those annoying minions. Yet despite this list of grievances they are highly successful, because they make lowest common denominator movies anyone between 1 month and 100 years old could watch.This brings us to the Grinch, a needless remake that no one asked for or wanted. After the Lorax's dreadful adaptation, the quality of this trash should come as no surprise. Yet it represents almost everything wrong with entertainment; it doesn't exist because an artist was inspired to craft a loving adaptation telling a story he\/she wanted to tell. It exists because it's a Dr. Seuss property and a Dr. Seuss movie prints the money itself.Anyway this movie is as lame and as generic as you could possibly imagine. The Grinch is comically sympathetic, but isn't likeable. I'm stunned that the filmmakers managed to suck out all character, nuance, and personality of the Grinch and leave him as a hollow shell who acts like an A**hole. Also the Grinch who should be a foul\/gross weirdo looks too clean and basic thanks to the simplicity of the cheap animation.The townsfolk are either comically evil, ignorant, or innocent. The setting is awful and feels empty, the music sucks, and the pop music REALLY makes your ears bleed in this one folks!One positive is the color pallet, very Christmas-y and very easy on the eyes. But again the animation is so basic and simplistic that each character looks so bland and unmemorable I can't even remember more than 4 character designs.Ultimately the quality doesn't matter (the studio knows this, which is why they sold this movie out to any company that would advertise it), people will see this and it'll make over $500 million at least. If somehow you like illumination animation movies, you'll like this one. if you don't then you'll hate this.",

We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions\/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there.",

Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience.

With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler\/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the \"damsel-in-distress\"  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than \"Begins\"  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than \"Begins.\" The  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud  Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing  in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter Matilda  Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this  role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.  Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4\/4\/1979-1\/22\/2008.",

You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst.",

So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film.",

        "body":"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel \"Star Wars\" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for \"Dark Knight\".Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, \"Dark Knight\" ably stands on its own with or without \"Batman Begins\". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the \"Batman\" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in \"Batman Forever\", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.\"The Dark Knight\" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.",

By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey\/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.This movie deserves a 10\/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!",

Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10\/10.",

It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating.

It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, \"Some men just want to watch the world burn.\" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest\/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received.",

However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.As of today (7\/26\/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip.",

This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight. The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc. No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!",

And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style. The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music. Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography. Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead. As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!",

But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings, he did kill people, he did go insane and laugh, but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it..Its been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledger's Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world, put in a dark and serious movie and make it work.. Other actors also played their part well, Christian Bale was good as Batman\/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully. This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, For those of you who haven't watched it yet, I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely..",

Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome.Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing.An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty.Superior to pretty much everything else.10\/10.",

        "body":"I had high hopes for this movie. After the box office flop 'Strange World', which looked loud and unappealing and most of all very un-Disney, it seemed this movie was going to be a return to form. It even promised the return of the great Disney villain, a concept strangely abandoned by the studio for almost a decade (preferring 'twist villains' or no villains instead).Sadly, the return of the villain is the only real benefit of this movie. For what it is, it's not terrible per se, but all is wholly forgettable, from the music to the animation to the characters. I'd say the latter is the most problematic aspect of 'Wish'. Asha is the most unoriginal, uninspired protagonist of any Disney movie. Even annoying leads in a Disney picture leave an impression, like the cows in 'Home On The Range'. Asha, on the other hand, not only looks like an identical twin of recent heroïnes like Anna, Mirabel and Rapunzel (the latter of whom she resembles most) but also acts like them. It's the exact same 'quirky awkward nervous teen girl' all over again without a shred of uniqueness that would make her a recognizable character of her own.It's hard to root for a heroïne as empty and shallow as that. Especially when the villain's objectives are equally as empty and shallow. He wants power over people because... he wants power over people? The story is severely lacking. You would expect more from Disney's outing in its 100th birthyear, but it basically boils down to something as banal as 'he has the wishes and she wants to give the wishes back'. It's not a very exciting proposition and there's not much you can do with such a bare bones simplistic story. Which I guess is where all the padding comes from. And by god, is it terrible.None of the goat's lines are funny. He's clearly meant as the funny sidekick but he didn't make me laugh even once. Nor did any of the other side characters, who are even more bland than Asha. Does anyone remember any joke from the movie that cracked a smile for them? I found the humor very much aimed at little kids, but then again I would say most of this movie is aimed at little kids. Even the animation looks like a saturday morning cartoon. It had a lot of potential, the blend of 2D with 3D. I will give the movie this: at least it looks different than the other Disney computer animated movies, the way handdrawn movies looked different (compare, say, 'Atlantis' to 'Lilo & Stitch').The most underwhelming aspect of this movie were the songs. Most of them are pointless, the lyrics are laughably weak and they fail to illuminate important plot points (as is customary in Disney musicals). I found them sadly unimaginative, not catchy or memorable, and with the villain song I was even hoping it would be over soon, that's how bad that one was. I also dislike the modern pop sound the songs had, which is jarring when shoehorned into a supposed fairytale. It makes you long for the days of the Disney Renaissance.All in all, 'Wish' is not the worst Disney movie by a long shot and it's wholly unoffensive and it had some potential but that potential was never realized. As it stands, it's a pretty mediocre film that serves as babysitter material on Disney+ but can't stand alongside the Classics of (even the recent) past.",

There are no stakes and the end result is a muddled theme, uneven pacing, and boring, flat characters. The film attempts to pay homage to older Disney classics and all the ingredients are there: lovable characters, a menacing, tongue-in cheek villain, cute animal sidekicks, and interesting concepts; but instead of \"showing\" the character beats like older films, we are \"told\" the story through bland dialogue and little action. Asha joins Disney's recent line of uninspiring \"adorkable\" female protagonists, with no defining motivations or character growth. This quirky, clumsy character archetype for Disney princesses has been recycled for the past decade with Rapunzel, Anna, Moana, and Mirabel. The animation and sound don't fair better, with bland, pop-y music that feels like filler and a combination of animation styles that look unpolished. There is no \"Be Our Guest,\" \"Part of your World,\" \"Let it Go\" or \"We Don't Talk about Bruno\".It's laughable that one of the lyrics to the song \"I'm a Star\" in the movie is \"in this universe we are all shareholders.\" Wish remains harmless entertainment for families but is a painful reminder of what this film sets out to do: please investors. This film is a rushed, soulless, by the numbers paint-job with no innovation in storytelling or animation. A massive disappointment to Disney's legacy and a poor excuse for their 100th animated film.",

If there's anything worth remembering though, it would have to be the watercolor-esque art style, but not even that justifies the movie's existence. Wish lacks depth and is painfully a face-value movie. It has a Disney-protagonist, a Disney-antagonist, a Disney-merch mascot, some Disney-music, and well yea, that's about it.The question though, is if kids would enjoy it. After all, that's who the movie is primarily aimed at. And the answer might be 'yes', but probably at a level no different than how they might enjoy say Cocomelon or something. There's nothing magical that might stand out and nothing that might inspire. It's yet another Disney showcase of good animation with less than nothing else to accommodate.",

It's not the best thing Disney has done but it's far from the worst.Getting the negatives out of the way: despite the fairy tale setting, all the characters talk and act very modern. The second song (\"At All Costs\") really feels like they went Jukebox Musical for a bit as it's only tangentially connected with what's happening on screen. In fact all the songs have the weird quality that, while they sound good in themselves, they don't feel like they're from the same movie. For celebrating Disney's 100 years, I wish they'd included at least some traditional animation.But here's why I can't hate this film: I love the subtext of it. It's all about rebellion against stifling authority. And how the combined strength of the many can overcome even the most powerful evils. The defeat of the villain was one of my favorite moments of Disney in years. I just wish the movie lead up to it better.Perhaps it being the 100th anniversary movie put to many demands on it. So many little references to past movies went over my head while watching it. Even the obvious one of each of Asha's friends being a reference to one of the seven dwarfs. Maybe if they'd let the film be its own thing and not a celebration of all that had come before it would have been better.I recommend it. But don't set your expectations too high.",

I didn't care for Encanto, Luca or Raya - although the animation was really beautiful the story felt hollow. The music in Wish is really great and I actually added the soundtrack to my playlist collection. The message is clear and powerful which makes me like it more.

        "body":"As a culmination of celebrating a hundred years of one the biggest studios ever, Wish doesn't compete with the classics it's constantly referencing. It is a really fun animated adventure that has all the greatest hits of a Disney animated movie whilst trying something new visually. Also it's just quite funny to see a Disney movie so clearly about unionising.Ariana DeBose is a phenomenal singer and in between ballads she brings a lot of endearing awkwardness and determination to Asha. Chris Pine revels in playing a proper Disney villain. No redeeming qualities, constantly sinking lower complimented by a great song that allows him to use an asset that's so rarely utilised.Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn greatest creative swing is the new animation style. It's probably the weakest out of all the recent ones that responded to Spider-verse but its storybook come to life approach still has lots of beauty to it whilst maintaining hints of the previous 3-D animation that dominated for so long.Like the rest of the film, the songs here are good without ever living up to the classics, they don't even really compete with something a lot more recent like Encanto. There's a couple that are pretty forgettable and three that are definitely a lot stronger so overall it's a majority positive success rate.",

        "body":"In the past few years, I haven't really been big with Disney's recent animated movies as while I did like \"Soul\" and \"Raya and the Last Dragon\", the other works like \"Luca, Encanto, Lightyear, Strange World, Elemental and Turning Red\" I wasn't really big on. \"Wish\", being the 100th Anniversary for Disney, manages to be bland and boring at its best.Throughout, the animation is solid as there are some good colors, solid structures and designs. There are some good musical instrumental backgrounds as well. I do appreciate that the story isn't based on a sequel, remake or something that already exists and Disney tries to introduce new characters and settings. But the issue is that the narrative is way too familiar from other stories and it lacks the creativity, energy and charm of the good old Disney princess movies which makes it pretty difficult to fully engage with emotionally or to care for. The lack of energy and bland style causes the characters to not be investing as well since none of the characters were engaging or interesting at all. However, the voice performances from the cast members are pretty good. Ariana DeBose and Chris Pine both provided really good voice performances. Including Alan Tudyk as Tudyk is great as usual with his voice works.The animation, as I mentioned, it's solid as the design models, colors, and movements are pretty good. With the animation using a mix of computer and watercolor, there are some really nice moments but admittedly, there were some animated movements or looks that felt odd, bland and slightly distracting. The dialogue is pretty clunky, the direction was boring, and the singing or musical moments, despite one or two songs being not too bad, the singing and song-writing wasn't good as some of the sound felt like it was written from AI. Like some of the voice and singing sound effects were pretty off. And as a whole, it was mostly boring.For this being the 100th Anniversary movie for Disney, it's quite embarrassing since there could have been any other movie that could have been pretty fun and all but it seemed Disney decided to go with the bland route.Overall, children and families will be entertained but this one is definitely one of Disney's weaker movies.",

But I think they still delivered the message. Besides, I also liked the soundtracks a lot.Maybe for kids the movie's story\/main plot is a bit far stretched or \"complicated\" but from an older perspective I can see what they wanted to say and I think it's a beautiful message. My interpretation of it is simply what was said in the movie, that the king took away his people's humanity to be able to control them. And I think the people being \"stars\" was a beautiful way of showing humans standing together against a \"government\" that doesn't care for all the individuals. It matches the state of the real world. The people who's hearts resemble stars are fighting for freedom and happiness, it's something we see now in real life and I think it's beautiful how they mirrored that in the movie. We won't let someone take control and make sure our wishes don't come true because our deep wishes is what makes us whole and keeps us striving.I agree that the animation itself lacked something but I see the potential. I was happily surprised when the movie, in my opinion, turned out to be much better than I heard it would. Wish has a nice and touching message.",

It's as if they had to reach a deadline so put in the minimal effort necessary to get it finished, which left us with a hollow movie devoid of any magic, held together only by its mind-numbingly predictable narrative.I feel bad for those who worked hard on this film because this could have been a good movie if the studio just took the time to fill it with personality and character. Instead, Wish is a pretty lifeless addition to the Disney canon.Note: Apparently there has been a hate-train trashing this film trending all over TikTok. It is why my niece already had a well-formulated opinion on the film at Thanksgiving dinner without having even seen it.

A lot of people have been criticizing this movie upon its release, saying it's overly generic and not as original as hoped for in celebrating 100 years of the Walt Disney Company. However, I think it's very good! Yes, there are some cookie-cutter and generic elements in the film, but it's not entirely a carbon copy of previous Disney films.The antagonist in this movie is revealed rather quickly; even from the very beginning, you know who the bad guy is and have a sense of how it will unfold. But I wouldn't say it's entirely unoriginal, as I've been hearing from many people. True, there are typical Disney songs with castles, kings, queens, and people making wishes upon a star, but I believe people have been overly critical due to recent disappointments with how the company has been managing things.Yes, I agree Disney hasn't been doing so well lately, but I don't think this movie is a bad addition to their tremendously successful catalog. I believe this movie truly holds the essence of emphasizing the importance of having wishes in your life but, more importantly, taking the necessary steps for your dreams to come true.There's been a lot of discussion about Disney's increased diversity in their cast nowadays, but I think it was a good fit for the new film. There were parts of this movie that honestly made me very emotional and pleased with its meaning and message because I've struggled in life to keep my dreams alive and well.Sure, there are talking animals and other Disney-esque elements thrown in, but the movie's meaning is what truly matters, and I think that's what people have been forgetting. I highly recommend people see this movie and not heed all the negativity. It's a good, clean, wholesome, and emotional family film that kids and everyone will enjoy, with meaningful and important messages about being honest with your dreams and never giving up on what you truly wish to become and more! Definitely check it out this holiday season!",

They try to do all these call backs to other Disney animated films since its \"Disney 100\" and it just ends up being strange and unsettling.The animation feels unfinished and awkward too.

I don't know why Disney animators can't create another Lion King or Little Mermaid or other engaging, fun movie. I remember taking my young kids to the annual Disney blockbuster movie - they were all excellent. But current creative staff aren't that creative and are making movies that nobody wants to see.The story is very generic and the songs, by pop singer-songwriter Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice, are rather uninspiring. But I have to admit that DeBose and Pine performed the generic songs well. The only time Wish shines bright is when it dares to get a little bit odd. Asha wishes on a star for everyone in Rosas to get their wish (so that they can work toward making them come true for themselves), and a plump, wiggly and mischievous star pops out of the sky and pays her a visit, sprinkling stardust on plants and inanimate objects, bringing them to dancing, singing life.The real test was that my grandkids were bored instead of being inspired.

Sure, the movie isn't perfect but I'd say its definitely worth a watch. I didn't want to disappoint myself when I saw this since it was Disney's 100th anniversary film, and I ended up enjoying it.I'm aware that people have criticized the film's animation style, but I thought it looked great. It was nice to see Disney trying something new like other recent animated films (Spiderverse, The Bad Guys, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish). It really captures the feel of their traditionally animated movies since that was how the studio started out. I also thought the songs were pretty good. King Magnifico was a fun villain and I also really liked the goat, Valentino. It was also fun to find all the Disney Easter Eggs scattered throughout the film. I do think Asha's friends could have been better developed though, since they're not really in the movie that much. I read that they are based on the seven dwarfs from Snow White, and that was a fun little nod. There are some parts of the story that I think could have been better written, but they didn't really bother me that much.Overall, I thought Wish was a decent movie.

Kids will like it, it's a decent family movie, but it's not anything I need to watch twice. In my opinion, Disney has set a pretty high standard with its past films (Ratatouille, Tangled, Cars, the list goes on and on) and this one doesn't even come close to that standard. Onward is way better than Wish, maybe check that one out instead if you haven't already and are in the mood for a Disney movie. Just my opinion! My bf and I both give this one a 6.5\/10.",

        "body":"LIKES:The Animation\n-Disney knows how to make things flow, a studio that can capitalize on their swollen budget and invest in making such engaging movements.-Anatomical accuracy is captured well, animals moving about with correct form, only straying to human dimensions in a small amount when necessary.-It flows and moves in a poetic style, with a dynamic energy to match the magic being cast in this movie. And the color that goes with it starts to feel like something out of Fantasia in terms of splendor and flow.-All in all, the animation still continues to prove Disney's elite level of making the unreal come to life in a way, and give us a treat for the eyes.The Voice Work\n-Animation relies on voice actors to bring characters to life, and our crew has managed to bring a cornucopia of talent that helps this feat.-Tudyk is still as fun as ever. His versatility is incredible, this time making a baby goat with a smooth velvety voice his primary objective. He accomplished much with his direction, delivering some great lines to appeal to many ages.-Pine sounds like, well Pine. His voice is perfect for the illustrious king, very poignant, charming, exciting, and yet still holding hints of rough nature. He pretty much is playing a generic Disney role and doesn't quite have the flair, but also is no slouch.-DeRose as Asha is great. A modern princess take, with a sensational voice that shows control over emotion, pitch, and delivery, I liked the work she granted the latest princess.The Design\n-It's an odd style, but I liked the blend of 2d and 3d animation styles into this hybrid granting an almost cell-shaded game like approach.-It holds the smooth movements of computer, but the color and energy of the original 2-D style and I think it accomplishes much for the presentations this movie chose.-Is it weird? Yes! In a way though, it works, as a sort of catch all to help make things pop for all the styles integrated into this movie.The Music Songs Themselves... Mostly\n-Disney has proven they can make a big soundtrack with songs that top the charts in sales. Wish is another success, to some degree, in my book.-A style that feels one part rock opera and another part theatrical stage show, the movie has plenty of that composer feel to it and perhaps the more unique aspect of the film.-Ballads are powerful and expressive of their dreams, catchy and yet beautiful at the same time. While other songs hold more engagement with their visual numbers than the song alone.-The product is another collection of good numbers that may be more of the focus and goal than the story itself, but one in which avid Disney music lovers will fall and repeat for years to come.The Inspiration\n-Perhaps heavier than other films, Wish is packed with a lot of things to teach the lessons to motivate the audience to do great things.-The story itself is a bit preachy on this, trying to rub it in my face the importance of dreams and how to make them come true.-However, I appreciate the lesson, despite the presentation, and found that some of the other character arcs at least tried to tie to this and help push the story.-Add in the theatrical music and the animated drawing holding such powerful control of emotions, and I felt they accomplished the inspirational tone they were seeking.Star:\n-The ultimate merchandising in this movie, the cute little character is my favorite one of the film.-For not saying anything, the little guy has a lot of heart and character, his emoting by far some of the cutest aspects I've seen in a while and somehow the most diverse of the group.-He does so much with his little form, knitting, pranking, and somehow inspiring himself, he is an adorable movie wrapped in a small bundle, one to surely be exploited by the House of Mouse.The Easter Eggs\n-The movie is a big homage to the history of the studio, and well... it's probably the biggest focus of this movie, or at least bigger than they imagined.-Disney lovers are going to love finding all the references and inspiration in this movie, cameos galore sprinkled throughout for one to see, or in many cases listen, to what the writers wished to acknowledge.-Even the credits pay homage to the magic of the studios and what came before, a stunning finish with a song that helps add the ambience to fans like me who love the cartoons released over the 100 years.-And the End Credit scene holds a weighted tribute to the man who started it all, and while not necessarily the most mind blowing, it does soothe the heart and soul.DISLIKES:The Characters So Auxiliary\n-Outside of the goat and the star, most of the rest of the characters are rather plain, boring, and a dull reference and cultural card than anything else.-Most of the characters have a gimmick, but often used in the singing and comedic roles, with little else.-Given characters like Pumba, Mrs. Potts, and the Dwarves, you would think they can accomplish more than spitting out one-liners and a some very limited action moments that hold little weight.-Such a shame given the strong work that Disney was known for doing so long ago.Story\n-Outside of the inspiration, the story really doesn't hold any magic for me either.-A rather bland story of unoriginal tales, the unique factor is mediocre and just lacking the splendor the animation has.-I found the tale rushed, full of the bland challenges and weak development that really felt robbed like the wishes of the kingdom.-So much potential, but so lost to the music and hidden references that what we got was a quick, almost novella story that will be good for those with small attention spans.-Such a shame.Placement Of Music\n-Another gimmick feeling aspect, the music is again good, passionate, and magical, but the placement feels a very modern motif.-Previous films found the ideal place to put a song, or use it to convey thoughts, feelings, and storytelling that fans have dissected for years.-Wish felt like Frozen in a sense, lots of songs in one movie, weaker and filling space, seeming just odd to break out into song and dance. A little more tact might have made the song even more impressiveJokes Are Mediocre And Kiddish\n-What happened to the double entendre jokes, the clever puns and misunderstandings, or even the well-executed insults?-Wish has none of that for me. More so forced emotional delivery, kiddy emphasis on butts and spit, and sounding like a social media stars trying to quote a scene like the character and failing.-Only a few jokes escaped this style, but for the most part, I felt a lot of influencer vibes in the writing, which just isn't my style given the track record of this movie.Weaker Antagonist\n-This was sad given again the potential of Disney villains.-Maleficent, Scar, Gaston, and Rattigan, these and more had design, class, skills, and backing that made them so much fun to fight in the movies and games.-But Magnifico, outside of the design to look like his actor, is kind of lame. He's cunning sure, but that's it. No major groundbreaking moves, a rather tame use of his powers, and even a boring climactic fight did little to make him memorable.-It's not he's a bad character, just again, rushed and forgettable, lost in the flood of things crammed into about 80 minutes of actual movie.Overall Forgettable\n-The movie is unfortunately not the magnificent production this company promoted for the 100th anniversary.-It's a movie that feels too full of stuff, gimmicks, music, and references superseding the story and flow, to make a rather lacking film.-I see many of my friends enjoying this who are die hard Disney fans, young kids that are like them, or just all about singing songs and finding homage touching.-But for me, it needed more time, more planning, a better story and better use of these ideas to balance into the story and fully cast the Disney spell they can do.THE VERDICT:\nI'm sure you can guess, but Wish did not have the magic I had hoped it would have. While the animation and design are beautiful, and the voice acting helps bring some fun, the movie is really more about finding the hidden gems than actually telling that Disney feeling story. A rushed mess of mediocrity with weaker side characters, a boring antagonist and paying too many cards without planning, it feels like storytelling remains a tertiary objective for the House of Mouse.. At least the music, no matter how oddly placed, was able to maximize the inspiration and give you the hope that dreams can come true, just in time for the holiday season. Is this a go for the theater? In a way yes, the sound system does wonders for the music, and 3D could be fun as you ride the nostalgia with a star in the lead. But story and majestic wise... well... that might be best left for a home viewing.My scores are:\nAnimation\/Adventure\/Comedy: 6.5-7.0\nMovie Overall: 6.0.",

After all those years hammering the message into our heads, they have forgotten it themselves! And that is one of the many issues with Wish. There's no love interest, and we, the audience, lose interest.Maybe we shouldn't. Maybe we should appreciate that love for your grandpa and your mom is enough, and that friendship with your buddies is equally important as passionate love. Or maybe Disney could make peace with love. When a young person loves another, it doesn't necessarily mean that they need to let go of their personality, ambitions, ideals or for that matter, wishes. Love can be, usually is, a good thing.Making an emotional story without love is not impossible, but it's hard. And the ingredients are not there in Wish. In the absence of love, humor can help. But the secondary characters in Wish, Valentino the goat or the mute lucky star, are not very good, and not funny at all. The music could help, but the songs aren't all that memorable. And the main characters, while decent, can't quite carry the story. Asha, a mix of Moana, Elsa and Pocahontas, is okay but she seems to lack a clear purpose that is believable, and we never really care much about her. Magnifico, the villain, may be the best character, but he feels so much like a rehash of other villains before him, that we struggle to see him as a character in his own right.Left without emotion, without humor, without great music, the film doubles down on weaponry, raising the stakes on the use of dark magic with every scene to try and keep the audience awake. But it's not enough. I dozed off a few times.My advice to Disney: make love, not war.",

I am watching the Angry Birds movie right now with my little kid and that looks WAY better than Wish, and that is 8 years old for crying out loud. Did any people work on this movie at all?

I had seen no spoilers except those offered by the trailers. Besides this being Disney's big 100 year movie, and that a lot seemed to riding on it, I knew almost nothing about it. That's all to say: my mind wasn't made up when I watched it.It's a classic Disney concept of a homemade fairytale.I actually really enjoyed it. The characters and the songs were great-- the story was good. The premise was good. The bottom line is that I thought it was enjoyable.I won't pretend that this movie was perfect, but not a lot of movies are. The pacing was lacking; there were scenes that made my husband and I wonder what made them keep it-- but I had a good time. Isn't that what matters? Going to the movies and having a good time?I've seen bad reviews and bad criticism after watching Wish-- some I believe is completely unwarranted. It's not Frozen-- its not very close. It's not the best movie Disney has ever made but it sure isn't even close to being the worst. It made my husband cry. The kid behind us said it was the best movie he had ever seen. What I'm trying to say is just give it a shot. Go into it and if you don't like it, that's fine. Just don't decide you hate it before you see it.",

        "body":"In an era where animated films often redefine the boundaries of storytelling and visual artistry, it's disheartening to see a studio with the pedigree of Disney deliver something as uninspired as Wish. The film, unfortunately, continues the recent trend of Disney's offerings feeling more like formulaic retreads than the innovative masterpieces we once eagerly anticipated.Wish stands as a particularly glaring example of this decline. While it boasts a visually appealing watercolor-inspired aesthetic, this artistic choice alone can't mask the movie's fundamental shortcomings. The narrative lacks the depth and nuance that once made Disney films universally appealing. Instead, we're presented with a collection of recycled elements: a predictable protagonist, a cookie-cutter antagonist, a character designed seemingly for merchandising purposes, and a soundtrack that, while competent, fails to leave a lasting impact.The primary audience for Wish is, of course, children. They might find enjoyment in the film, but it's a fleeting and superficial pleasure, akin to the temporary distraction offered by shows like Peppa Pig or Paw Patrol. There's an absence of the magic and inspiration that could make \"Wish\" a memorable experience for its young audience. Ultimately, the film is an example of wasted potential, showcasing high-quality animation without the compelling story or characters needed to make it truly resonate.",

We took 15 people to the movie on Thanksgiving evening. One person of the 15 said they enjoyed it. A few fell asleep and the rest of our family felt as I did.

This movie is better than most Disney movies and is a pretty decent way to celebrate the 100 year anniversary of Disney. I think the premise of the shooting star was very well executed and I think the villain did a pretty good role for a villain even if it's not the as memorable as the 90s Disney villians. I think the main character Asha is a Meh character but she is very likable and has a pretty good I want song. While most of songs are average, there are some highlights with the Villians song and Ashas I want song. While there are issues with the pacing and it's somewhat off anaimation, it has a pretty good plot, decent characters and ok songs to make up a movie that is enjoyable, but is lacking some off the Disney charm from back then.",

Bringing in an outside singer\/songwriter is something that Disney hasn't done in a while. Julia Michaels absolutely brought her best to this soundtrack.Honestly, I've found myself struggling to make it through Disney's last few animated features.

Catchy songs, it tries to do something different aesthetically and touches on its predecessors without being too brazen, and the story itself is quite a clever idea, albeit an idea that could've been explored further (and better!) but wish is still feel good film worth a watch on a rainy day and doesn't deserve the hate it's got.

        "body":"People must be desperate to WISH for a good movie from Disney these days. It isn't here. Extremely shallow plot and story and truly cringe songwriting. The writers couldn't even bother to make anything rhyme when shoehorning in their messaging. Nothing to do with the actors, color and what not (don't even start), and all to do with poor writing. It's like Disney put a gun to someone's head and demanded a movie be created based on the \"When you wish upon a star\" Disney theme. If we find out in the news later that that someone likely will be found dead on the floor and that the script was actually AI-generated, I wouldn't be surprised at all. Disney is reaching new lows. Truly.As mentioned by many others, the plot is crazy thin, there is no inner struggle, no mistakes made, no heroes journey, no villain having any sort of depth. On the last note, they actually teased the villain having some sort of back story and justification, but almost as soon as they introduced some of his history and fears, it was swept away reminiscent to a proverbial rug pull straight into shallow villainy. How awesome would it have been if we could be somewhat torn and sympathetic to the idea that some wishes actually can be damaging to others\/dangerous, as the movie insinuates for maybe 5 seconds before casting aside? Wow this could have been a decent story, but Disney chose to walk on eggshells. They can't please anyone these days so we must all be triple wrapped in cellophane and styrofoam and forced to watch a \"safe\" movie. They truly lost their touch. It's unfortunate (just in this one instance :D) that my kids really wanted to see this movie so I indulged them. Shame on them! (and me!) lol.",

The animation is a great mix of 3D and some 2D elements where from afar it can look like a painting. For Disney fans it has all the elements you are looking for such as an over the top fun villain, cute fun side characters, amazing music and a good message.

        "body":"Closing out Disney's 100th year is this movie, presumably original planned as a celebration of all things Disney, but ultimately, it's another film that whilst again ending up profitable, is symptomatic of what would not be considered a banner creative year for the company.Asha (Ariana DeBose) interviews to be apprentice to King Magnifico (Chris Pine), whose kingdom thrives on his granting of wishes to his subjects. Asha learns that all wishes are submitted to the King, but he selects which ones are granted and that some people, including Asha's elderly grandfather will never receive theirs. Asha wishes on a shooting star, which comes to the ground and begins granting wishes of its own. With the threat to his power now present, Magnifico turns to dark magic to keep his throne.So, like \"Elemental\" and \"Strange World\" before them, I don't think that \"Wish\" is a bad film, it's just below the standard that Disney have set for themselves. In fact, with the possible exception of \"Encanto\" which I liked how long has it been since Disney produced a really good animated film? 2017 and \"Coco\" probably.\"Wish\" looks fine, sort of a blend of CGI animation with traditional animation. The performances are fine with he leads performing well and Alan Tudyk reusing his standard voice for a talking goat, who produces most of what laughs the film has. The problem is the story. I wonder if they were struggling to find a balance with \"easter egging\" their history and flat out using it. Some of it's quite clever, it took me a while to notice that Asha's friend group have the same characteristics and outfits as the seven dwarfs, for example. Whereas later it just flat out says that a character is Peter Pan. It reminded me of the scene in \"Ralph breaks the Internet\" with the Disney Princesses, which was the only memorable scene in that film. Disney are in the nostalgia business, but sometimes seem surprisingly muddled on how to do it.Again though, I didn't hate \"Wish\" but I can't imagine I'll ever feel the need to watch it again and Disney is long overdue a really good film.",

If you still think Wish is good, listen to.\"Friends on the Other Side\"from The Princess and the Frog, then listen to \"This is the Thanks I Get\" from Wish.

Also I feel Disney was trying so hard to promote itself by using the correct color theme and made a few Disney references in the film. Finally, i have nothing wrong with lead confident independent female roles but that's all Disney is giving us lately. I get that Disney doesn't want the princess to be dependent on men but they don't have to make it like that. They can make the confident and independent princess and tie in a love story because some of the best Disney movies have love in them. Anyway i hope Disney can learn from this movie and possibly improve and make the movie everyone has been asking for.",

        "body":"In Wish, Disney honors their tradition, and at the same time adds a new movie to their catalogue of animated films. Wish is a nice movie, but lacks what makes Disney animated movies so special.In Wish, young Asha wishes on a star, and gets more than she bargained for when a star comes down to help her in her quest to defeat the evil king Magnifico.The greatest advantage the movie has is its gorgeous animation, the brushstrokes painted beautifully on the screen. It is a wondrous blend of hand-drawn animation and 3d animation, a la Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse. I hope we get many more films animated in this style, as it is very relaxing and nice to look at.If only the story matched the visuals... An overly simple story lacks anything of substance. And yes, I'm taking into account that this is a kids movie. I sympathized with the villain (who did not begin the movie evil) in the beginning of the film, only for him to suddenly turn evil out of no where. The film also suffers from a horrifying over dependence on magic. The songs are very good, but they all sound about the same, which isn't a problem in the movie, but I can't imagine the music in this movie selling many CDs. I do have to give the voice actors some credit though. They didn't do anything award worthy, but they did an excellent job.That being said, while I watched this movie, I enjoyed it. The only reason I went to see it was to take my nephews. Disney has a rich history of making the greatest animated classics of all time. They have a proven formula that works, and I hope they either return to it in the future, or try something else besides Wish. It's a decent movie, but there's nothing memorable about it, and I don't expect it will be long before it is forgotten.",

        "body":"So what I believe Disney was doing with Wish was to tell kids not to spend their time wishing away their lives by consuming Disney products and movies. When you place your hopes and dreams into the hands of a power greater than you, such as corporate Disney, you become a slave to what they want serving only to make them more powerful and you weaker.It's a bizarrely subversive hit on themselves and done in such a way as to not make it interesting or fun enough for repeat viewing or to sell toys which is an additional hit on their shareholders who will be seeing massive intentional losses for the 8th movie in a row. This fits the current counter cultural rebels who have been running Disney behind the scenes for the last 3-4 years making sure nothing that comes out is a hit or at the very least moves products off of shelves.Is South Park right? I feel like they may know a lot more about what is really going on at Disney than anyone else at this point.You can probably just skip this one and just know that Disney is currently trying to blow up the mold of \"Wish Capitalism\" and remove itself from being such a huge part of generations of families. It's like the efforts to take control of oil companies just to run them into the ground at a huge loss but for the benefit of future generations. That is what Wish depicts in fairytale format.Disney over the last decade will at some point be a fascinating case study in American Consumer Culture and Counter Revolutionary Thought, and with this latest move I think Wish is setting itself up as the perfect teaching example.Wish is really brilliant but not in a way that families are going to want to watch - which in itself is the real point of the movie.",

The animation and sound are done very well and the several songs are performed well.The premise is that a man became fascinated with magic and sorcery when he was young and he devoted his life to perfecting it for himself. He found a small island in the Mediterranean and established his land there, with himself as king. He would accept wishes from the common people, but would not grant all of them, it depended on what he thought the result would be.Wishes are depicted as light blue ballon-like vessels, about the size of an adult's hand, and they would float up to the top of the large gathering hall.For one young girl, she wanted the wish of her old grandpa to be granted but the king never would. So she takes it as a personal mission of hers to correct what she views as a wrong, not only for the old man, but also for the others in the kingdom. She gets surprising help when a small yellow star actually comes down to help out.As I already said, we were entertained.",

The storyline follows a young lady whose father has passed away, and she now resides with her mom and 100-year-old grandfather. In their town, everyone is allowed to make one wish which is stored in the kingdom, and once a year, the king grants one person's wish. The young lady endeavors to convince the king to grant her dying grandfather's one wish. When met with resistance from the king, she decides to take matters into her own hands.Co-directed by Chris Buck (Frozen) and Fawn Veerasunthorn (directorial debut), the movie features the voices of Ariana DeBose (West Side Story), Chris Pine (Star Trek), Alan Tudyk (Rogue One), Victor Garber (The Flash), and Evan Peters (Dahmer).While my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed Wish last night, we found the film a bit uneven. The storyline, with its potential, great characters, and interesting circumstances, left me wishing for a darker villain and more dire circumstances to heighten the level of desperation. The society and backdrop are somewhat underdeveloped. However, the animation, songs, and 3D effects were top-notch. The baby goat steals the show with a solid 10\/10 performance - I could watch an entire movie centered around him.In conclusion, Wish felt like a blend of Frozen and The Emperor's New Groove in many ways, though it didn't quite reach the same level.

        "body":"The movie begins with about twelve minutes of straight exposition about the magical kingdom the heroine lives in and its benevolent magical king, and how when you're 18, the King takes your dream from you and then randomly grants subjects those wishes, which they've forgotten. This put me on guard. Children's movies should start out simply: there's a baby deer born in the forest, or an ogre everyone wishes to kill. If the story teller wishes to elaborate, or play with our assumptions, that's all part of the game, and even small children recognize these tropes, like the five-year-old daughter of friends. We were at a performance of TWELFTH NIGHT, and when Beatrice and Benedict start arguing, she turned to her parents and asked \"They fall in love, don't they?\"Kids understand these things, despite the confusion of people who think that Elmer Fudd trying to shoot Bugs Bunny would cause me to shoot my brother. I understood the difference between a cartoon rabbit and my brother, and we fought constantly, which my parents understood. This is why we had no fire arms in the house, and knives were kept out of our reach.I seem to digress, but I do not. On discovering that the King has no intention of granting her aged grandfather's wish because it is too vague and might easily be dangerous, she immediately concludes the King is Evil, and wishes on a star, which comes down and grants wishes totally at random. Animals -- particularly her pet goat -- and flowers speak. The King asks his loyal subjects for helping finding out who did this. They ask for a little clarity, so he goes to his library, opens some Evil Magical Books, and, well, you know how this will turn out.WISH is probably the most lazily written children's fairy tale I have encountered in the movies. The jokes are variations on other Disney cartoon features, the songs are all strident anthems about the characters' feelings, and all the male characters are evil, ancient, or emotionally compromised and hence useless. Is it necessary to make men the villains in the name of Feminine Empowerment? Is all male authority corrupt, while women are always kind and helpful?No. I think Disney is simply telling the story they believe their audience wishes to hear. I have no doubt that the parents and guardians of many small children think things like this are what their children should hear, but it is neither the story I wanted to hear when I was a child, nor did it teach me anything useful: that the world is a dangerous place, and you need to be wary, but help can come from unexpected directions, and it's not a miracle or magic.

Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort in the HARRY POTTER films) anchors the events as the \"Dean\" of Cardinals who is tasked with leading the disparate group of Cardinals to a consensus pick of the next Pope. He acts as much as a Detective as a Facilitator as he battles his own conscious of faith...and ambition...all while uncovering schemes and plots of some of the \"humble servants\" vying for the top job.Ably assisting is John Lithgow, Isabella Rosellini and quite a few others (mostly unknown) who battle for the \"pole position\" in the race to be the next Pope. Special notice should be made to GREAT Stanley Tucci for his supporting turn as one of the contenders who's platform seems to be \"I don't want this\" but who, underneath, really, really wants it.Don't be surprised if both Fiennes and Tucci (as well as Director Berger) are mentioned come Oscar nomination time (they are that good).As stated above, this film has twists and turns galore and it is a fun ride to roll with these turns, but if I am being honest, I felt that this film went \"one twist too far\" and should have\/could have ended 10 minutes before it ended (without the one last twist). Now, some would say that this final twist is the point of the film, but...I would have been fine without that point being made.You be the judge...and join other \"adults\" in the movie theater.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

        "body":"Greetings again from the darkness. It feels like it's been a while since we had a good old fashioned serious-minded, tension-packed, \"big\" drama film featuring big movie stars. Well, that's exactly what director Edward Berger, fresh off his Oscar-winning ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (2022), serves up with his latest. Writer Peter Straughan (TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY, 2011) has adapted the 2016 Robert Harris novel, and the result is a welcome crowd-pleaser that may garner some Oscar consideration.Ralph Fiennes delivers what may be his best performance yet. And that's saying something for the much-respected actor who has previously excelled in such films as SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993), THE CONSTANT GARDNER (2005), IN BRUGES (2008), A BIGGER SPLASH (2018), and THE MENU (2022). His impressive career is only enhanced by this most recent role of Cardinal Lawrence, saddled with the heavy burden of facilitating the titular Conclave charged with electing the new Pope. As the film opens, the beloved Pope has just passed ... and as they say, \"let the games begin\". Of course, these games are all about political maneuverings and power struggles and backroom promises. Director Berger opts to show us very little of the actual negotiations, and instead puts the various iterations of loyalty on display during each successive secret (of course) vote.Within the confined walls of Vatican City and the Sistine Chapel, Cardinal Lawrence's time is mostly spent investigating tips, scolding others for their behavior, and dealing with the immense egos of the few being considered (including himself). Stanley Tucci plays Cardinal Bellini, who pretends to not want the job while campaigning as the 'progressive' voice the church needs now. John Lithgow is Cardinal Tremblay, one of the most assertively ambitious who may or may not have purposefully undermined the work of another. Either way, Lucian Msmuati's Cardinal Adivemi is the victim of Tremblay's actions. Cardinal Tedesco, portrayed by Sergio Castellitto, is the most outspoken in his desire to return the church to the old ways (Latin masses forever!), what he sees as proper. Bryan F O'Byrne plays O'Malley, assistant to Lawrence, and yet, despite all of these men, it's Isabella Rossellini as Sister Agnes who manages to shoot (figurative) fire from her eyes, while maintaining her 'place' and significantly impacting the process. She is stunning and memorable in her limited role.Early on, a big surprise arrives in the form of Cardinal Benitez (Carlos Diehz) of Kabul, who was the most recent appointee by the previous Pope, and unknown to the others. As a novel, this may be a real page-turner, and yet the movie never rushes from one moment to the next. Tension builds with each revelation and tarnished robe and secretive plot. Although the film barely skims the years-long sexual abuse scandal in the church, there is a stream of twists and turns that keep us on our toes as the Cardinals are sequestered. It's fascinating to see how cinematographer Stephane Fontaine keeps things visually interesting in an enclosed environment filled with characters who aren't allowed to go anywhere else. Another aspect I truly appreciated was the unusual musical score composed by Oscar winner Volker Bertelmann. This is the type of movie which often features overbearing music to 'enhance' tension, yet Bertelmann's notes are effective jabs at just the right times.Power plays, corruption, and political stunts are all present as these Men of God bungle the process of picking their next leader. Importance of the mission and tradition pale in comparison to ego and self-interest. The symmetry to U. S. politics is unmistakable and surely a purposeful approach by Berger. The final twist may be a bit out of proverbial left field, but in a room filled with secrets, perhaps that's as it should be. To balance the tension and seriousness, anyone paying attention will appreciate the subtle humor, especially as it plays out as these relics muddle through modern day situations (technology, social progressiveness, terrorism). This is certainly not a film created for Catholics only, although for a brief moment, I worried we might have one that could be subtitled, \"The Catholic Crying Game\". Fortunately, it's one with a tension-filled story, terrific visual shots, a perfect score, and superb acting ... a fun movie to watch.Opening in theaters on October 25, 2024.",

        "body":"Director Edward Berger, known for his sharp storytelling, has delivered a cinematic gem with \"Conclave,\" a film that transcends the boundaries of the typical thriller to delve deep into the heart of the Roman Catholic Church. Based on Robert Harris's novel, this adaptation is not merely a translation from page to screen but a reimagining that breathes new life into the already rich narrative.Plot and Execution: The film follows Cardinal Thomas Lawrence, impeccably portrayed by Ralph Fiennes, as he navigates the labyrinthine politics of papal election within the Vatican's ancient walls. Berger meticulously crafts an atmosphere of suspense where every whispered conversation, every secretive glance, is charged with the gravity of the election's outcome. The plot unfolds with the precision of a Swiss watch, each tick and tock echoing the heartbeat of the Church itself.Performances: Ralph Fiennes anchors the film with a performance that is both understated and powerful. His portrayal of Cardinal Lawrence is a study in restraint, where every subtle expression conveys the weight of his character's internal and external conflicts. Supporting him, John Lithgow as Cardinal Tremblay offers a masterclass in villainy, weaving charm with cunning so seamlessly that it's impossible not to be captivated by his machinations.Themes and Symbolism: \"Conclave\" isn't just about the election of a Pope; it's a microcosm of power, tradition versus modernity, and the human condition. The film tackles these themes with a deft hand, never preaching but always prompting thought. The climax, with its revelation regarding Cardinal Benitez, serves not just as a plot twist but as a profound commentary on identity, acceptance, and the evolving face of global religion.Cinematography and Score: The visual language of \"Conclave\" deserves special mention. The confined spaces of the Vatican are shot with a claustrophobic intimacy that mirrors the internal struggles of the characters. The score, haunting and evocative, enhances the sense of isolation and high stakes, complementing the imagery to create a nearly tactile experience of the conclave's tension.Conclusion: \"Conclave\" is a tour de force of filmmaking. It's a film that entertains, provokes, and lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. Berger, along with his cast and crew, have not only adapted a book into a film but have elevated it into a critique on power, faith, and human nature. For those who appreciate films that challenge as much as they entertain, \"Conclave\" is a must-watch, deserving every bit of its 9 out of 10 stars. It's not just a film; it's an experience that invites you into the heart of one of the world's most secretive institutions and leaves you questioning, pondering, and ultimately, admiring the artistry on display.",

It should have ended with the white smoke pouring out while the crowds cheered and Cardinal Lawrence looked up to the sky... job well done. But no, they had to insert a completely irrelevant, fantastical twist for who knows why (Did M. Night Shyamalan stop by the set?). Go see for the great acting and imagery. Hopefully a Director's Cut will edit out that contrived twist. (p.s. Show the white smoke! That's what we were all waiting for.)",

        "body":"The death of a pope and the subsequent election of a new one is an event that the Catholic world follows with great interest. As a period of mourning for the deceased pope is observed, the suspense builds and a worldwide audience learns the names and nationalities of the main contenders. This movie shows the protocols that follow the death of a pope and takes the viewer inside the walls of the Vatican as we see the various contenders. Ralph Fiennes is superb as Cardinal Lawrence, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, the church prelate who organizes and manages the conclave. Stanley Tucci as Cardinal Bellini is the liberal favourite while Sergio Castellito is Cardinal Tedesco, the conservative alternative. Other contenders rise and fall. There is tension and infighting that highlights the rivalry because the stakes are so high. The outside world never knows what form the discussions take or the possible conflicts because the process is highly secretive. This movie lends drama to what could happen during the course of the conclave. Some conclaves are over in a short period of time; others take longer to play out. In this movie, the voting reaches a stalemate followed by a surprise and then another. We see how the Vatican and the world are not at odds but are interwoven. As an observer of these conclaves, I was drawn to the character of Cardinal Lawrence and how he had to navigate the challenges and limitations of his role. A fine movie and a great performance by Ralph Fiennes. The ending seems a pleasant surprise and is followed by another surprise that is just a step too far and detracts from an otherwise great drama.",

        "body":"Lies. Deception. Manipulation. Strategy. A game of chess on a global scale. Every move calculated, every alliance scrutinized. A complex and riveting contest of strategy and influence. Edward Berger takes a process as intimate and holy as the conclave and turns it into something thrilling that echoes the scheming, backstabbing nature and intrigue of Game of Thrones and Succession while also feeling strikingly relevant. Conclave is a meticulously constructed behind-closed-doors thriller where religion and politics clash and the souls of petty men are tested for a chance at supreme power.Conclave is a film about choosing the least objectionable candidate to prevent undoing decades of progress. Hmm... sounds familiar. Not to get too political, but there is a reason this film was released when it was, and the overall challenging messages presented in the film could not be more relevant to the current political climate in not only the US but many other countries in the world.I'm seeing a lot of enjoyably quippy Letterboxd\/social media reviews saying that this is a funny movie about priests gossiping (\"What if an episode of Gossip Girl took place entirely at the Vatican????\"), and that isn't untrue-but it also neglects to mention that it's a very earnest and profoundly soul-stirring picture about the tension of faith, the desperate search for certainty, and the true purpose of the church in the world. This is the kind of well-staged \"men in rooms\" drama that feels like it could've been made in the 1940s, or the 90s. Imagine an Aaron Sorkin film (The Social Network, Moneyball, A Few Good Men) in the Catholic Church. That is Conclave.The ensemble is outstanding with Ralph Fiennes delivering a performance that is as nuanced as it is commandingly powerful. The taut atmosphere is amplified by a pulse-pounding score, and immersive sound design, though moments of over-the-top levity occasionally breaks the tension, adding an unexpected layer of entertainment to this riveting high-stakes election. It's one of the most riveting, immaculately crafted films of the year - a masterclass in classic Hollywood filmmaking brilliantly directed by Edward Berger who most recently made All Quiet on the Western Front.There's this \"rule\" in film editing: don't show the door closing; just cut to the other side. It's meant to be a reminder to avoid unnecessary or mundane sequences. Conclave ignores that entirely. Characters pause, and shuffle around between lines, as their sneakers squeak on Italian marble. They actually eat and swallow food without cuts, and stop in the middle of important dialogue just to make a Nespresso in real time. People are calling this a thriller (and I agree), but it's also a Vatican hangout movie. I couldn't care less about the subject matter, yet I haven't felt this engrossed in a film in a while. It's all the \"fluff\" that Berger includes that made everything really work for me. It has so much rich texture. One of the best of the year - and it's because you see the doors close.This is the kind of awards season crowd pleaser that really hits all of the right buttons. Excellent performances across the board. Narrative twists that both make sense and completely subvert expectations for a film surrounding Catholicism. Visually stunning. It's a blast.I also enjoyed it because it's a very (very very) progressive film dressed in the most conservative package imaginable. Very of this moment. I think Conclave has one of the most profoundly soul-stirring and theologically provocative endings of any movie I've seen in a while. It's no wonder that lots of people in the typical target audience for films like this are baffled by it. But I loved it so much.Conclave is an incredibly entertaining thriller that peels back the many layers of selecting a new Pope and is anything but boring. A compelling, relevant watch about the state of leadership and elections in our modern world.Succession is my favourite show, and here I got a whole movie of it just set in the Vatican! Brilliance.",

        "body":"Conclave, directed by Edward Berger takes viewers into the world of a Vatican conclave following the pope's unexpected death. The premise alone promises tension and moral intrigue as cardinals gather to elect a new leader. But it ultimately left me feeling distanced and disengaged.One of the film's main ideas centers on how becoming too certain about our beliefs shuts down meaningful dialogue. I appreciated some of the quotes that analyze how this certainty blocks understanding and discovery, especially in moments of conflict. But while I agree with this concept on the surface, it was hard to connect with it in the film's execution.A major issue for me was the pacing. Although Conclave isn't especially long, it feels longer due to the slow buildup. I get that the movie wanted to show how important and careful the selection process is, but as a viewer who isn't particularly religious, the stakes didn't feel high enough to keep me fully engaged.On a technical level, the visuals and set details were impressive, the costumes, the Vatican halls, the atmosphere of tradition, all were richly rendered. But for me, these visuals felt more like a backdrop than a core part of the film's experience. A strong setting usually enhances a story, but here, it wasn't enough to make up for the lack of connection I felt with the plot and characters.Overall, Conclave has some redeeming qualities and moments of insight, especially for those who enjoy stories with religious or political themes. But for me, the film's core ideas and pacing just didn't click. I respect what it aimed to explore, but I walked away feeling that the story could have used more emotional grounding to truly engage a broader audience.",

        "body":"It's more than a little frustrating when a film seemingly has all of the elements needed to make it work except the one that's most crucial, the one that enables a production to brilliantly succeed or doom it to failure - the story. Such is the case with director Edward Berger's latest, the much-anticipated, much-celebrated drama about the convening of a papal conclave to select a new pope. From a technical standpoint, the filmmaker has pulled together everything that should make this an epic picture - a gorgeous production design, stunning and inventive cinematography, and a stellar cast featuring superb performances by the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow and Isabella Rossellini, as well as fine turns by such lesser-known performers (at least to American audiences) as Lucian Msamati and Sergio Castellito. The picture also raises some insightful observations (though a little too infrequently for my tastes) about the current state of the Roman Catholic Church, particularly its foot-dragging on implementing reforms, the incessant high-profile scandals that have rocked the institution, and the rising tide of unflattering public perceptions among its increasingly skeptical practitioners, all of which weigh heavily on the College of Cardinals in determining who should be named as the new Holy Father. Unfortunately, though, the story and script leave a lot to be desired. For starters, much of the film's opening act moves by at a glacial pace, frequently causing one's eyelids to become more than a little heavy. As the picture moves into the meat of the story - the conclave itself - it waxes somewhat melodramatic, not unlike a glorified 1980s prime time TV soap opera. Its attempt to come across as an intrigue-laced thriller amounts to more than a succession of backstabbing segments in which the leading candidates to become the next pontiff are systematically eliminated through the revelation of skeletons in their respective closets. Finally, as the movie enters the stretch run, it throws in several twists and turns that either come completely out of left field (and somewhat implausibly at that) or that predictably materialize on cue thanks to the planting of patently obvious clues early on that were wholly impossible to ignore as the story plays out. Regrettably, these narrative foibles undermine all of the other fine attributes that this production has going for it, ultimately amounting to a case of being long on style but a little skimpy on substance, a shortcoming that also plagued Berger's last feature outing, \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (2022). Unlike many others who have been so profoundly moved and thoroughly captivated by this release, perhaps my not having been born and raised Roman Catholic has somehow prevented me from fully appreciating the depth and magnitude accorded to this offering's contents. But, as someone who seeks to evaluate everything I screen on an equal footing, I can't help but observe that \"Conclave\" simply doesn't measure up when it comes to what it takes to make a genuine big screen epic.",

Elegant, crafty, poised, but never shy of getting emotional when needed, Fiennes abilities of balance continue to impress me with how he invests in making a good character. Tucci goes a bit more theatrical, his character the voice of the \"liberal\" side as his aggressions and passions are artfully delivered in a manner fit for the stage to offset Fiennes' calmer tones. Lithgow, on the other hand, is almost a mix of the two extremes, holding his usual support role that keeps so many of the leading sides held and providing perhaps most of the engaging mystery element in the search for the truth. All the cast members excel in this movie, each member vying for the seat, making adequate contributions and performances to present those ideas. I'll use this moment to also say I'm impressed that Conclave is very efficient at keeping all the players introduced at the beginning of the movie ingrained in the story. Conclave is all about the interactions and connections that each Cardinal has to go for the throne, and Berger's team has kept them all engaged in the very complex story. And with such smart dialogue, the characters and performers have plenty of material to bring this realistic tale to life and give one a feeling of being involved in such an established tradition. When the drama is integrated to spice things up, the realism does not lose much merit, resulting in a nice balance that plays well to the character development and office traditions.Finally, the best thing about this movie is the cinematography for viewers like me. Powerful camera work adds so much emotional support to the film, with impressive coordination of shots, each diagrammed to give you the best visual display. In my viewing, I got wide shots of the church that portrayed the majestic expanse of the historical architecture, close-up shots that give the intensity of a character's stare as they ponder the latest information, and panning shots that give one fleeting shots of someone walking throughout as they seek to make things happen. Brilliant lighting and filters accompany these shots and further add that dramatic touch, but they seldom get in the way of seeing what's going on in the shot. Fantastic editing brings all of this together in smooth cuts, logical storyboards, and not relying on too many effects to enhance the experience.DISLIKES:Slow In A Lot of PlacesVery Pretentious At TimesMost Of The Mysteries Have Lackluster FinishesBecomes More About PoliticsContrived Ending That Shatters Some of the DisbeliefSummary:\nFor all the acting and visual strengths of this movie, Conclave does fail for some other elements that take away from the splendor hinted at in trailers. The movie is slow, with other points feeling slower than others, as they do their best to move towards the election of the Pope. Primarily in conversational bantering and repetitive sequences in the same rooms, the film sometimes gets lost in this sequential discovery of facts and, without the assistance of more exciting movie elements, becomes droll outside of drama lovers. A mystery is established somewhat at the beginning, but this quickly fades and starts becoming more of a political drama than the mystery thriller I thought it would be. If you don't care to be reminded of the current political views, this is a major limitation as the movie starts to leave the mystery elements behind, with many of the questions having rather bland and pretentious answers. This is especially true at the end, where politics becomes a key focus and almost takes a major divergence towards feeling like social media debates and a philosophy class rather than an engaging end to the mystery. What could further disappoint is that the movie's ending completely undermines realism at times and again forgoes the logic and just about all the actions and litigation you see in the movie. That stumble led to a very disappointing ending in regards to the selling point of the movie despite the symbolic and characteristic ending they pulled in at the last minute.The VERDICT:Conclave is indeed a stunning piece of work for me, primarily for the acting and cinematography that brings this tradition to life in extraordinary detail. I loved the wit, the realism, and the process of electing a pope alongside the earlier moments of trying to figure out the mysteries at hand. It's a fantastic portrayal of characters while also testing the traditions and credos that many discuss about religion in their various media. While the film thrives as a political and religious drama, it fails in regards to a mystery and thriller, and adjusting your mindset may help you enjoy this movie more with that effort in mind. Contrived, pompous, and slow make this film less engaging, and the realistic content is going to provide less opportunity to escape if that is what you are looking for when hitting the movies. In the end, this film is probably best reserved for home vs. A theater trip, but for quality acting, definitely give this one a try.My scores are:\nThriller: 6.5-7.0\nMovie Overall: 6.0.",

Conclave, a thriller about the fictional selection of a pope, shows more about the ambitions of many \"papabili\" (those qualified to become pope) than it does about doctrine.The curia is a curious place where cardinals reside and ambitions are rampant along with vice, jealousy, bigotry, and lies. Dean Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes) is almost devoid of ambition (see Plato's adage above). Consequently, the ambitious rumors come to him and thus to us. At times the shenanigans seem ripped right from our current presidential election, where, as it gets close to November, we hear even more rumors and plain bad will.Lawrence, a dignified man with scruples, tells why his own doubts are characteristic of emerging wisdom: \"Faith is a living thing because it walks hand in hand with doubt. With certainty, there is no need of faith,\" he preaches. \"Let us choose a Pope who doubts.\" For Lawrence, a candidate who is all certainty, will as pope drag the institution back, failing to keep it fresh and contemporary.Director Edgar Berger helms with a steady hand on the intimacies kept from the crowds waiting for The Vatican's smoke to announce a new pope. Such secrecy lends itself to a fine thriller, whose secrecy is nectar for the audience which can claim to be in on it all.Besides the clues and considerations, we watch the human drama of competing for the big prize and not quite the best candidates. Nuns, however, can be relied on, especially Sister Agnes (Isabella Rossellini), who watches and intrudes only when necessary.After a reveal or two, things settle down to what it is, just a good thriller with the college of cardinals providing juicy bad boys.Not all popes have been perfectly holy: witness Pope John Paul's covering up sex abuse cases and Pope Benedict XVI formerly being a Hitler Youth. Or read Dan Brown's Angels & Demons. However, in this unabashedly fictional Conclave, the cardinals may choose a man who \"sins and asks for forgiveness.\" Or, a Platonic choice of lacking ambition, too. And a measure of doubt.",

        "body":"Sixty-one years ago, I went to see The Cardinal (1963), a major film welcomed by the RC community. It too had big stars, lavish production values, and early accolades. Too bad that the community does not welcome this one as well, since there is no cause for offense in it. It is simply a welcome diversion in a dark historical moment. Thankfully, the horror film stuff I was expecting is absent. One leaves the theatre feeling good. That is why I have no problem with its farther fetched bits. I appreciate the parallel with 12 Angry Men (1957). The Godfather Part III (1990) really was a commentary on then-contemporary events in the RC Church. This one is harmless as a dove, and yet very exciting.",

        "body":"This film had me at the edge of my seat. It was visually stunning, packed with a stellar cast, and had a script that quickly captivated my interest. However, as a Catholic, I noticed lots of very small subtle heretical things\/statements sprinkled throughout the film and tried to ignore it, I know it's common for Hollywood to do such things. Plus, I do like to think of myself as a little more open minded and I try to be more unbiased, as I am sure characters like some of these cardinals with some of the same opinions, do reside in our church.The film had me wrapped up until the very ending which I just feel like was pushing a political agenda. I walked out feeling disappointed at once again, the inaccurate representation of my Catholic faith, yet torn because parts of the movie were phenomenal. I won't be surprised if this wins awards because as a film, it was fantastic. As a Catholic, It was a paradox of something that felt like art, yet a twisted insult.",

Many nice touches add to the interest and entertainment value, e.g. Lines delivered in Latin with subtitles in English. Very approachable presentation. I especially liked the audio work, as the lines were easier to hear and understand than in many other recent films, and the score was very effective. The characters and staging may have been sanitized a bit to appeal to a wider audience. A more gritty, realistic portrayal would have been an interesting alternative here. This film should be especially entertaining to those who take in interest in the evolution of the Papacy through new popes, showing the changing understanding of how to interpret Christ's teachings in the modern world. Definitely see this if you have strong opinions about the choices the Church makes in selecting popes. Non Catholics will also enjoy this look at how the sausage is made, and we don't see this inside perspective often. The only comparable film recently was \"The Two Popes,\" which was a more cordial story. The present film is more about the intrigue and Machiavellian behavior in the College of Cardinals. The climax of the plot is near the end, but it's well worth the wait, and quite unpredictable.",

Ralph Fiennes leads it with solid support from Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, Isabella Rossellini ( looking more like her late, great mother than ever). I would encourage everyone to see this before people start revealing some of its secrets. At the crucial climax of the film, it was amazing to hear the audience's reactions, and I heard one elderly man sum it up with, \"I didn't see that coming.\"True.

As of this writing in October of 2024, Ralph Fiennes is probably the best actor in the world who doesn't have an Academy Award on his shelf, but I would not fall over in shock if that fact changed after this year.The score is imposing and loud and it totally works against the expertly composed imagery and shots that are set up by Edward Berger.The only weirdo thing that threw me for a little bit of a loop is that, without any spoilers or details, there is kind of a twist that descenders upon the viewer completely out of the blue which lead my audience screening to collectively say \"Whaaat? Umm. Okay? I guess?\" Don't get me wrong, it's not offensive and doesn't ruin the movie but it was sort of a bizarre turn that left me a little bit baffled.As a regular person who is 0% religious, I found myself completely engaged and locked in for the entirety of this movie, though it does move a little bit slow towards the beginning.

That said, on the strength of CONCLAVE it seems clear that Mr Berger is a gifted director who extracts high quality from his actors, his cameramen, his editors, and pretty much all other departments - notably script writer Peter Straughan off the Robert Harris book. The only aspect that disappointed me was the score, which at times sounded like intestine-trapped winds.Ralph Fiennes delivers the finest performance I have seen from him, better even than in his Oscar-winning ENGLISH PATIENT or SCHINDLER'S LIST. I have no idea whether he is Roman Catholic, but he certainly convinced me in his role as Cardinal Lawrence with his expert use of Latin, his thoughtful actions as conclave dean, and his knowledge of all matters papal and Vatican-related.Plaudits, too, to Isabella Rosselini, who looks and acts more and more like Ingrid Bergman, her mother. Tucci and Castellitto - playing Cardinals Bellini and Tedesco, respectively - also stood out.Very clever script. Unlike other viewers, I did not find the ending a copout, or weaker than the rest of the film. The new pope is the carnal embodiment of God in all its complexity, a human who has seen war, devastation, abject poverty, religious hatred, and both sides of the human condition. No one is fitter than he for the papacy, even if the manner in which his secret is revealed, on the back of other unsettling secrets involving the various papal candidates, seems repetitive and a trifle tough to believe.As a Catholic, I am glad to see the Church portrayed in a fair manner. The political manner of electing the new pope, with candidates seeking votes from their cultural and geographical peers, the very human interests that drive the papal competitors down to moves in contradiction with the cloth, interests that override the Church's rules, ultimately had to prompt the wrath of God, which happens with Michaelangelo's Judgement Day fresco in the background, when a bomb blows in the street outside the Sistine Chappel.CONCLAVE raises quite a few issues that have stayed with me and on my mind. It is an intelligent, informed film that uniquely grabbed my attention in spite of sizable stretches in Latin, Italian, Spanish and, of course, English. The Tower of Babel, basically.I rate CONCLAVE must-see. 9\/10.",

CONCLAVE is a thriller based on the 2016 novel of the same name written by Robert Harris. The Pope has passed away, leaving the seat vacant. Cardinal-Dean Thomas Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes) is appointed to gather a papal conclave to sequester together to vote on who the successor will be. Sounds kinda boring right? Well you'd be wrong. Being one of the most secretive and ancient events, I found some of the little details with the process fascinating. This movie has some more amazing aspects to it, like puzzle pieces that just fit together perfectly. First, the acting. They utilize an ensemble cast that includes Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, Sergio Castellitto, Lucian Msamati, and Isabella Rossellini. Each character is looked at carefully in this, by the protagonist and by the audience as well. Fiennes gives an understated yet powerful performance that might be in consideration for a nomination. Second, the technical work. The cinematography works well with the reds and whites of the costumes with the greys of antique Roman marble rooms. They weren't allowed to film in the Vatican, but they still managed to find certain buildings in Rome. The score knows when to throw in a note for suspense, but also to have silent moments, lingering with a character or two, holding a shot for longer than you're used to. At the danger of sounding cliché, they honestly don't make movies like this anymore. In today's society, people have less and less of an attention span, so when a movie like this comes along, it feels refreshing. It also lets the dialogue unfold the story and I appreciated how clear and concise it was. The ending is definitely going to be divisive for some, but I loved it. Overall, CONCLAVE is much more than just Oscar-bait. It is patient, understated, claustrophobic, and it reminds us that we are all human. A movie about the protocols of choosing a new Pope has no business being this amazing.",

The film excels in creating a claustrophobic and politically charged environment, where alliances are formed, secrets are revealed, and morality is questioned.The performances are the standout feature, with a strong ensemble cast that brings depth to the characters. The lead, in particular, delivers a nuanced portrayal, balancing conviction and vulnerability. The cinematography is equally commendable, capturing the grandeur of the Vatican while emphasizing the confined, almost suffocating nature of the conclave itself.However, in some occasion, the film's attempt to balance political intrigue with spiritual introspection sometimes feels uneven, leaving certain themes underexplored.But the most divisive aspect is the finale. While the ambiguity of the ending can spark discussion, the final moments feel unrealistic and out of place-seemingly added for shock value rather than narrative cohesion. This choice undermines the careful buildup, leaving the audience unsatisfied and questioning the filmmakers' intent.Personally, this was a significant drawback that made me reconsider just how good the movie truly was.Despite this, \"Conclave\" is a thought-provoking and well-acted drama that offers a unique perspective on power and faith. With a more grounded and cohesive conclusion, this film could have been exceptional-potentially a 9\/10.

        "body":"Edward Berger's 'Conclave' is filled with surprises. It is the story of the Catholic College of Cardinals during its casting votes for a new Pope. We know from the outset (or at least sense) who the main candidates will be. And so over the length of the film we learn more about each candidate, the result of which either removes him from the running or catapults him to the next level of candidacy.As we know nothing about these men, what we come to learn (both good and bad) is not so much a surprise as it is a contrivance. I mean we have to have a reason to root for or against the characters. For me, however, certain of the contrivances screamed 'contrivance' and for a short time, threw me out of the story.But, and this is a very big 'but', the final revelation \/ surprise can make or break the film for you. If, like me, you have a problem with it (from a plausibility perspective) you'll leave the theatre mumbling, 'Nope, nope, I don't buy it. Good film, great performances, but, Nope, don't buy it.' On the other hand, if it works for you (and it very well might), you're gonna leave the theatre singing its praise.Ray Fiennes as the Dean of The College is the film's central character. His performance is award-worthy, absolutely. Stanley Tucci and John Lithgow are two of the College's candidates and they're their typical fine selves. Tucci, however, seemed a bit too .... contemporary in his speaking; too much of a modern lilt to his phrasing (but I think I'm being picky). Isabella Rosellini as a Senior Nun holds one of the film's surprises and divulges it in so strong a manner that you have no doubt about her ability to 'handle' the men of The College.For me, the film's best performance was that of Sergio Castelli; his snarling, drooling, over-the-top conservative-to-his-core Cardinal is the perfect foil to Fienne's tempered Dean of the College. When Castelli was on screen, it was as though the electricity had finally been turned on.So. Surprises; many.They work; you'll love it.They don't; Not so much.",

He is fantastic in this role as he tries to conduct the election of the next pope. You can feel his character struggling to try to remain objective. At times he must decide when to make decisions to involve himself or cross lines in order to make sure that fair play in a sense is maintained.I have delayed this review as I have taken time to ponder over the direction the filmmakers decided to take. In breaking it down my feelings towards it become less and less. While it is interesting while you are in the theatre you later realize that all you were watching was rumours and gossip about different cardinals. The movie is truly a one man show. You see no behind the scenes action or development of the other characters or candidates for the papacy.The score and sound highly elevate what would otherwise be some very boring scenes.Lastly the end just throws everything out the window. Most of the movie seems like what one might expect an election at the Vatican to go like, but the end is just terribly unrealistic and somewhat insulting to the rest of the film.

        "body":"I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like \"The Phantom Menace,\" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was \"How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?\" rather than \"How entertaining is this film overall?\" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Mary Poppins,\" are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, \"Adventures in Babysitting\"), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like \"Home Alone\" and \"Mrs. Doubtfire.\" Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.But much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--\"Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers\"--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.Not that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.The problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary \"muggle\" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.Although the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.The answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing.",

        "body":"There's nothing like the first in a series, is there? The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the \"magical\" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were added in post production!Usually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as \"guest stars\" but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word \"earwax\" to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as \"Maggie Smith cats\", mumble \"Shouldn't have said that,\" when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling's fantasy world, there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.Each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn't immediately conjure the name \"Fluffy,\" chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don't laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don't know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you're missing out on one of the great joys in life. If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie.",

        "body":"Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling, a character was born:  A boy.  A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world.  And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves.  Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard.  But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was.  It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister-- Harry's mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry's father because he, too, was a wizard.  When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to `Hogwarts,' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born:  The gift of magic!  And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it's a journey you will never forget.\tWhat a monumental undertaking to even think of attempting-- translating and transferring this passionately beloved work from novel to the screen. Because to millions of people, Harry and his companions are so much more than merely characters in a book; these are characters for whom people have made a special place in their hearts, which puts a great burden of trust upon the man who would attempt to bring them to life.  And Chris Columbus, it turns out, was the right man for the job.  More than rising to the occasion and with some magic of his own-- and a lot of help from an extraordinarily talented cast and crew-- Columbus has delivered a film that is not only true to the story, but true to the very spirit that makes Harry Potter so special.  The special effects are absolutely beyond astounding, and Columbus, with a keen eye for detail and without missing a beat, keeps it all on track and moving right along at a pace and with a sense of timing that makes this an absorbing, thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable experience from beginning to end.  From the opening frame you get the feeling that you're about to have a singular experience; and you're right. Because you've just entered the world of Harry Potter.  And it's magic.\tEven having the best special effects do not a great movie make, however, and this film is no exception; what catapults this one to the top are the performances, beginning with Radcliffe, whom you quickly forget is an actor playing a part.  And that about sums up what kind of a job this young man does here.  Without question, he IS Harry Potter, physically and emotionally, and when he waves his wand and does what he does, you believe it.  A wonderful performance by a gifted actor who has a great career ahead of him; without question the perfect choice for the role of Harry.\tAlso turning in excellent performances are Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione.  As with Radcliffe, the casting here could not have been more perfect.  Grint is `Everyboy,' with that special glint in his eye and a manner that makes him especially endearing.  And the spunky Watson adds some real sparkle to the film as Hermione, the one with the sense of urgency and the wherewithal to get things done; a real role model for young girls everywhere.\tIt's obvious that a lot of care went into the casting of this film, and it's a big part of why it is so successful.  Richard Harris, as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore; Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall; John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander; Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell.  Exceptional performances from one and all, with two that stand out as especially memorable:  Robbie Coltrane, who readily conveys the fact that Hagrid's heart is of a size that matches that of the man; and Alan Rickman, as Professor Severus Snape, deliciously droll while demonstrating menace through the fine art of articulation.  \tThe additional supporting cast includes John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick), Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick), Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley), Zoe Wanamaker (Madame Hooch), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Harry Melling (Dudley) and David Bradley (Filch).  From Rowling's imagination to the written page to real life (albeit via the movie screen), `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a triumph many times over; a unique film of truly universal appeal, the likes of which is as rare as, well-- a sorcerer's stone.  A film in which adults and children alike will rejoice, because it speaks to the heart in a universal language of life, love, experience and imagination; a film that states unequivocally that magic exists-- as long as there's a single child with a single dream somewhere in the world, and real wizards like J.K. Rowling, Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew around to bring it to life as they have here.  An instant classic in every sense of the word, this is truly a film for the ages.  A remarkable achievement, this IS the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10\/10.",

In only one movie, we've seen amazing creatures, friendly and foes, teachers that are heroes and villains, we've witnessed the wisdom of the legendary professor Dumbldor, the movie made us guess who will be who and on who's side in the chapters to come and above all, we had fun. I will never forget the part where Harry buys all the things he needs to start his wizard journey, the authentic look of the streets, the shops and the bank will be part of the Harry Potter legacy forever.",

        "body":"Ah, the first film adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is an 11-year-old boy who comes to find out that he is a wizard. He lives with his uncaring Muggle (non magic) aunt, uncle, and cousin since his parents died when he was a baby. They were murdered by a dark and powerful evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Harry would be dead too, but was miraculously saved, making him something of a legend. Upon learning of his guarded magic roots, Harry gets enrolled in Hogwarts- a British school for witches and wizards. While there he learns to come into his own, meet people that are actually good to him, and learn more of his dark past. Looking back, I don't know if it was a good idea to have Chris Columbus direct this, as he does have a reputation for being something of a hack, albeit a decent one. I think his direction is okay here. Yeah, retrospectively it could have been better, but it could also have been much worse. At least with him at the helm we get a good amount of whimsy to go along with a bit of menace, and that's a good thing, as the book was likewise not too heavy on the darker stuff (though that sure changed as time went on). Many liberties are taken, which is weird since the book is quite short, and the film is two and a half hours. It does get the point across decently enough though, and also works as a piece for those unfamiliar with the source material. John Williams provides great music, there's wonderful art direction and set design, and there's some nifty set pieces too. Featuring an all-British cast, this film is impeccably cast, and the performances are good too. Finding decent child actors is hard, but they really scored here. My enjoyment of this movie has waned over time, but it's still not a terrible piece of work by any means, so check it out.",

        "body":"We live in a world where economics is hard. This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite, cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations, this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However, it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film.Two and a half hours is not long to explore a wonderful, magical world. Furthermore, the directors have bowed to the inevitable temptation to show us things that cannot be communicated so effectively in a book. The consequence is the feeling of a slightly breathless sprint in places.It also means that the movie has to stay true to the spirit of the book rather than to the letter of it. There are omissions and there are changes. The changes that were made capture and maintain the spirit of the story really well; indeed, there are places where the story is more clearly and straightforwardly told in the movie than in the book. Some aspects of the story are fleshed out on screen and the additions are delightful, completely in keeping with the flavour of the world.The humour of the movie is inevitably more visual than that of the book; no belly laughs, but a lot of smiles. Some punchlines have changed, but the reasons why the jokes are funny remain the same. Not knowing exactly what's coming next is a good thing! It's all kept tasteful, classy and above the belt; there's nothing to cringe about.The voice acting is almost uniformly brilliant. However, there are occasions where some of the actors are required to convey high emotions and are only given a second or two of face shot, or head-and-shoulders shot, to do so. This isn't as much freedom as they need and they fall a little short. The blame here must fall on the decision to give the actors too much to do too quickly, not on the actors themselves.Other than these rare jarring instances, the physical acting is frequently excellent and seldom less than completely adequate, judged against the highest of targets set by the book's clear emotion descriptions.Dan Radcliffe has the look, the mannerisms and the charm of Harry down pat. His strongest expressions are the bemusement that must be inherent at entering a world where science does not rule alone and the bravery that Harry shows in his achievements. Emma Watson possibly slightly overplays Hermione, but does so in a fully endearing fashion. There's one scene which gives her too little chance to truly express panic; otherwise her performance needs no changes.Rupert Grint has comic timing way beyond his years, hitting Ron's lines perfectly. Tom Felton makes a stylish Draco; Matt Lewis' Neville character suffers from the acceleration, so the finale does come as a slight characterisation shock.The Phelps brothers' Fred and George are distinctively cheeky rather than proactive pranksters; Chris Rankin imbues Percy with genuine authority. Sean Biggerstaff shines; his Oliver Wood is likeable and an ideal Quidditch team captain.Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid is the single dominant adult character, with maximum laughs extracted at every step. The movie changes strongly exaggerate one side of Hagrid's nature, though; probably inevitable considering how much plot exposition his character has.David Bradley has a vicious Argus Filch; John Hurt's Ollivander is an eccentric treat, giving a wonderful introduction to the Wizarding World. The professors are uniformly excellent, though Richard Harris' Dumbledore comes off as disappointingly flat until the end.The most ambitious point of the movie is the computer generated imagery. The stills are wonderful, but the fastest animation is restricted by the limitations of real-world technology. The book makes extremely stringent demands of the CGI; sometimes their overall effect in the movie is merely good rather than insanely great. Some of the magic spells and effects look awesome; others don't capture the imagination nearly so much.The world cannot yet completely convincingly animate human beings doing inhuman things, which serves as a clear reminder that you need fictional magic to make the impossible possible. The Quidditch scene is the most demanding of them all; while the sequence is action-packed and good-looking, disappointingly, it's not a total success. Perhaps some of the scenes would have been better with more conventional special effects? (For instance, the lower-tech-looking Sorting Hat scene is one of the most delightful of them all.)The set looks gorgeous. However, it may not stand up to detailed analysis. It's fairly obvious that things are shot in many disparate locations, rather than one big Hogwarts School near Hogsmeade.The score is absolutely wonderful. The soundtrack may rely too heavily on The Famous Bit, but it's clear that the balance and mixture of things in the finished movie are exactly right.The feel of the whole movie is everything fans could have hoped for. The dialogue is intensely measured, the colouring is suitably epic, the selection of what to leave in is really tightly considered. You get chills in your spine at the right places; you feel the triumphs as all-encompassing endorphin highs. It's clear that the production have thought long, hard and lovingly. They are true fans of the story, they are the right people for the job, it all bodes very well for the second film.So it could never have been the film that the hyper-literalists were hoping for, then, but it is as good as the practicalities of the real world could possibly permit. Don't expect miracles and you'll love it. I look forward to watching it again and again.8\/10 at the very least. A really satisfactory film!",

        "body":"HARRY POTTER \/ (2001) *** (out of four)Here's a method of evaluating a movie based on previously published material: ask yourself if the film makes you want to read the material from which it is based?  Before the release of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" I was one of the few remaining souls who had not read J.K. Rowling's fantasy book series. After screening the first film installment, I did want to read the book. Borrowing the novel from a family member, I briefly skimmed over the chapters. The book's intelligence and similarities with the film really surprised me.  With over 100 million copies sold in over 46 different languages, J.K. Rowling's best-selling series of books has become a worldwide phenomenon. Naturally, with soaring expectations abound, the filmmakers felt great pressure to create a faithful adaptation. They have. This film is essentially a visualization of the words in the novel, with very few differences. That said, the film does run into a few conflicts with the book's story. The middle of the movie has nowhere to go. It's like a false second act; almost nothing of major significance occurs in this period of the film. The young characters wander from scene to scene with nothing much to do and nothing much to say. We're left with a grand display of eye-popping special effects.\n\"Harry Potter\" certainly dazzles us with a solid beginning and an engaging final act, however. We first meet a young wizard boy named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). Soon after the film opens, the boy discovers he has magical powers. He's then thrust into an enchanting world of sorcery, magic, and witchcraft. He's sent to a school for young wizard children, where he meets new friends, learns about magic, and participates in fun competitions. But someone at the school doesn't like Harry, as mysterious events begin to occur. Harry soon finds himself in the middle of a diabolical scheme of revenge. Who is the culprit and what do they want with Harry?\nThe film asks some involving questions. Too bad it doesn't give enough depth to the side characters or subplots. We don't really care about the mystery because we don't know enough about the suspects. The movie does conclude with a twist, but it doesn't encourage another examination of the movie. It lacks a foundation altogether. The story spends so much time foreshadowing the villain's identity, it is pointless for the story to abandon its proceeding plot points and develop a new villain at the end. The book gets away with this; the movie does not. After his gentle \"Home Alone\" and sweet-natured \"Stepmom,\" many questioned the ability of director Chris Columbus to bring a sense of darkness to the story-and for good reason. \"Harry Potter\" contains charming, likable characters and a rich pallet of lush, inventive images. Unfortunately, the film lacks an edge. It's missing the dark atmosphere Rowling's novel so vividly brought to life. Columbus does construct some memorable sequences, but the individual scenes themselves are much better than the movie as a whole.Despite it's childish story and pre-teen characters, many define \"Harry Potter\" as a film for all ages. While that's debatable, during my screening, adults were plowing through the isles every five minutes. Going to the bathroom? Getting drink refills? Buying concessions? Who knows? But not a single child budged from their seat. Their eyes were glued to the big screen. Conclusion: It's a sure-fire experience for children, especially if they've read the books. But adults may not encounter the same enticement as kids. Then again, if I had nothing better to do than to count the people leaving the theater, why am I recommending the film?",

That is:  the story of a young boy who has suddenly had his wildest dream come true, and who now must deal with his newfound celebrity, his amazing magical heritage, and most of all, day to day life at Hogwarts with his friends (and enemies).  The movie is more preoccupied with populating Hogwarts with ghosts and moving staircases than it is with characters of any depth.  Everyone from the book, Harry included, suffers from a serious lack of on-screen development, and as a consequence the story lurches  ponderously from event to event without the throughline that stong character development would bring.  I, for one, am not easily impressed by effects, no matter how impressive, especially when they are a duplicitous substitute for the real strength of a story such as this:  character.",

        "body":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a film directed by Chris Columbus. For many years, I hadn't given a damn about the Harry Potter series. But seeing the fanfare surrounded by the series, I decided to give it a try. After watching this one, I can definitely say that I am on the verge of being a fan.Plot: Harry Potter, an orphan living with his uncle and his family is invited to Hogwarts School of Magic to become a wizard.Story and direction: I had watched this part around the time it released but never just kept in touch since I didn't understand a word. Seeing it now as an adult and a movie lover, I just fell in love with this fictional world created. The characters, settings, story, etc.. all just feel seamless. Thanks to J K Rowling, Steve Kloves and Chris Columbus who have done justice to the source material provided to them. I feel the themes are so very relevant in this film. The intricacies of those themes are valid in the current world we do live in. This is what I just exactly want from any story presented to me. Although the film is very long, I never felt bored for a single moment. And to adapt quite a huge novel comes with responsibility and precaution, which the makers completely justified. The sets are huge and awesome. You just feel you are in Hogwarts actually. Also each characters costume is just to marvel at. John Williams once again just proves why he is the composer of the century. But I did feel some flaws to the film. Being a first film, the main plot of the film comes at around the 90th minute of the film. Also the VFX of the film felt very amateur considering some great VFX was done in the years preceding this film.Performances: I would say that the casting of the film is just perfect. Applause for the casting team is deserved. Never do you feel that another actor should play the role. The kids, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felon just to name a few are fantastic. These 10-11 year old just steal your heart. Also the other cast like Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane make themselves likable.Favorite Scene: There were many favourite scenes in this film for me. But one scene in particular was the troll scene where Harry and Ron decide to save Hermione and after the saving Hermione vouches for the boys. This is the scene where you actually happen to see the bond solidified between the 3 as friends.Verdict: For anyone who just loves fantasy film and worlds with great visuals, this film is just for you. I assure you won't be disappointed. I plan on seeing the entire series now because I am fascinated by this world and want to see what else has it got to offer.I am going with an 8\/10.",

Daniel Radcliffe is very likable as Harry, and he is given solid support by a funny Rupert Grint and a good Emma Watson, though she was annoying at times. The scene stealer was definitely Robbie Coltrane; I actually can't imagine anyone else playing Hagrid, Coltrane was just hilarious. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were also great, but for me the standout was the late Richard Harris. Now I much prefer Harris's interpretation of Dumbledore. He was soft-spoken, and actually fitted the part better. Both of these qualities were lost in the interpretation that Michael Gambon gave. I am not saying that Michael Gambon was bad, he just wasn't my ideal choice for Harris's replacement. The film is fairly faithful to its source material, and looks very beautiful. However, it is a bit long, and very young children may find Voldemort too frightening. I know because I have triplet brother and sisters who saw it, and couldn't sleep for about a month after viewing. In conclusion, a very good film, well performed and quite dark. 8\/10 Bethany Cox",

Harry goes to a magical school, Hogwarts, where he learns the truth of his heroic parents and meets two other wizards, Ron and Hermione who soon become his best friends and they discover the power of the sorcerer's stone and what might happen if it's put into the wrong hands.Harry Potter I have to admit is off to a good start with me, it had wonderful and magical effects that anyone could enjoy.

Okay, okay. I'll stop with the superlative negatives. Surely there have been worse, and, yes, off the top of my head, I can think of many that are worse. However, for a book that over 125 million people have read, and for a movie that cemented the record for the biggest opening weekend in history, and also for a book that has had not only kids but critics singing its praises, and also for a movie which one particularly fat-headed critic called the Wizard of Oz of its generation, I am more than severely disappointed. I know that, had it not been so overhyped, it would have been just as bad. Now, however, my anger for it is completely hardened and it's going to be a passionate battle for me for years to come.I go into an in depth criticism, but it would be impossible for me to keep to 1000 words. There is hardly a piece of it that I liked. As a film, it was poorly edited, poorly acted (by most), poorly filmed. The only really memorable scene is the troll in the bathroom, although the payoff to it makes no sense whatsoever. The Quidditch game, which has been hyped to all heaven, is completely boring and poorly created. It looks like the FX guys created it with photoshop. When the chess game looked like it was about to be the most exciting sequence in the film, Christopher Columbus, who, I must say, lives up to his reputation completely, begins to edit furiously. I heard afterwards that this was done to avoid a PG-13. My immediate thought is that the filmmakers didn't trust their young audience to enjoy watching a chess game, no matter how exciting it might have been. I'm still not sure which story to buy.But the person I really want to tear into is J.K. Rowling. What a hack. Never has the word \"hack\" been more fitting. A former waitress, her idea of imagination is to call things by weird names. Only in the mind of a psychopath (or idiot) could the name Draco Malfoy or a Cerberus clone named Fluffy be considered clever. Writing children's literature is not difficult, but this is simply awful. She's clearly ripping off Raoul Dahl like there's no tomorrow, especially in the exposition. The game of Quidditch, which seems to be a drawing point of some sort, is absolutely nonsensical. As a preteen, I invented much more interesting games with much less interesting playing pieces. Quidditch is a game where people score ten points at a time, unless someone catches a special type of ball, which ends the game immediately. So theoretically, the game could end in thirty seconds. And all the other forms of scoring matter not at all. And let's talk about the surprise climax. Really, anyone could have been standing in front of that mirror at the end. It is tremendously unclever. And the penultimate sequence, where the crown is awarded to the best dorm, is anticlimactic and just rude to the children of Slytherin, We only hate one of them, so why should we be happy that the award at first goes to them, and then is cruelly snatched away. And what about Hogwart, anyways? If you're not supposed to use magic when you're away from Hogwart, why the heck would you want to be a wizard anyways?Friends, you're well on the path to making your children drooling morons. If they want a great series of books about sorcery and magic creatures, make them read the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. This is the most soulless garbage imaginable. And I thought Shrek had taken that title. 3\/10",

Rowling's beloved novel \"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone\" hits the screen.Each of Rowling's four Harry Potter books have been critically acclaimed worldwide best-sellers, turning a generation of video-game playing children into avid readers.In translating Rowling's world of wizards and magic to the screen, the film makers claimed to be intensely aware of the fans' high expectations and had sworn to be faithful to the book.\"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone\" is indeed the most loyal film adaptation of a book that this fan has ever seen.It's the story of an orphaned boy who discovers on his eleventh birthday that his parents were wizards and that he is in fact a famous and powerful wizard himself.Released from the clutches of his desperately ordinary (and non-magical) Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia - and their deliciously obnoxious son Dudley - Harry takes his place in the wizarding world as a first year student at the venerated Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.A great deal of \"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone\" is an introduction to this fantastic and dangerous world and its richly drawn characters. There's not only a lot of plot to cover in this film, but an entire world to create.At two and a half hours long (hit the restroom before it starts), the film includes the book's most memorable scenes, bringing many of them to life with pure cinematic wizardry.The Quidditch match (a soccer\/hockey\/rugby thing played on broomsticks) is much more exciting on the screen than on the page, as is the bathroom battle with an enormous mountain troll and the larger-than-life game of wizard's chess.The frightening aspects of the book are in full force in the film, and its PG rating (for some scary moments) should be taken seriously.\nScreenwriter Steven Kloves (\"Wonder Boys\") has done a fine job of streamlining Rowling's tale while maintaining its spirit. Director Chris Columbus (\"Home Alone\") makes good on his promise to be faithful to the book. But at times the film is a bit too reverent; you want the actors to cut loose and have a bit more fun.Columbus clearly understands that fantasy works best when it's played most real. Across the board, his fine ensemble of actors are so perfectly cast that they appear to have literally stepped out of Rowling's book.\nIn the title role, Daniel Radcliffe pulls off the very difficult task of playing an introverted hero who spends most of the movie reacting to the amazing sights and events around him. He beautifully captures the deep soul and untapped potential of Harry Potter. And when this kid smiles the screen lights up.Rupert Grint is delightful as Harry's sardonic buddy Ron Weasley and Emma Watson nearly steals the film as their overachieving friend Hermione Granger. Three cheers to the film makers for giving three unknown child actors the top billing they deserve.The strong cast of veteran actors includes Richard Harris as the wise Headmaster Dumbledore and Robbie Coltrane as the lovable giant Hagrid. Alan Rickman is wonderfully villainous as Professor Snape and Zoe Wanamaker has just the right touch of girls gym teacher as flying instructor Madame Hooch.\nAs the strict but just Professor McGonagall, Oscar winner Maggie Smith seems born to play the role - and is ready for another Oscar.John Cleese (as Nearly Headless Nick) and Julie Walters (as Mrs. Weasley) have all-too-brief cameo roles, but if the next film \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" remains true to the book, we'll be seeing more of them.In addition to being highly engaging, the film is a marvelous thing to look at. From the bustling wizard street Diagon Alley to the magnificently gothic Hogwarts School to the dark and misty Forbidden Forest, the film breaks new ground in imaginative production design.To paraphrase the film's tagline, let the magic (and box office records) begin.",

        "body":"\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is not merely a film; it is a beautifully crafted portal to a realm where magic is both fantastical and deeply relatable. Directed by Chris Columbus, this cinematic adaptation of J. K. Rowling's beloved novel serves as the enchanting introduction to a universe teeming with wonders, challenges, and heartwarming friendships.From the moment the audience is introduced to a young Harry, portrayed with sincerity by Daniel Radcliffe, we embark on a journey from the mundane to the marvelous. With his signature round glasses and untameable hair, Harry is the quintessential underdog-a boy who unknowingly carries the promise of an extraordinary legacy. His transition from the neglected existence in the Dursleys' home to the hallowed halls of Hogwarts is a masterclass in storytelling, beautifully encapsulating themes of belonging and self-discovery.The film is a spectacle, rich with immersive details that bring J. K. Rowling's enchanting world to life. The breathtaking depictions of Hogwarts, with its moving staircases and magical creatures, transport viewers to a place where imagination reigns supreme. Each room, each shadowy corner of the castle, feels alive-a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of the set designers, makeup artists, and visual effects teams. The magic of Quidditch is thrillingly captured, both exhilarating and hilarious, showcasing the whimsical yet competitive spirit that pervades the wizarding world.The film excels in its ensemble cast, from the steadfastly loyal Ron Weasley, played with excellent comedic timing by Rupert Grint, to the effortlessly intelligent Hermione Granger, embodied by Emma Watson with a blend of confidence and vulnerability. Their friendship with Harry is portrayed with authenticity; it is both playful and profound, emphasizing the power of companionship in overcoming adversity. The trio reminds us of our own childhood friendships, filled with shared dreams, fears, and adventures.Supporting characters, such as the warm-hearted Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), the enigmatic Dumbledore (Richard Harris), and Malfoy's smarmy arrogance (Tom Felton), enrich the narrative, creating a tapestry of personalities that resonate with viewers of all ages. Each character, no matter how small, contributes to the overarching narrative of courage, friendship, and the battle between good and evil.John Williams' iconic score envelops the film in a cocoon of nostalgia and wonder, with unforgettable themes that pierce the heart during moments of triumph and reflect the gravitas of despair. His music is the heartbeat of the film, guiding us through its emotional highs and lows, making the magic feel all the more tangible.\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" captures the essence of childhood-where every corner promises adventure, and the impossible becomes possible. It invites us to believe in the extraordinary while rooting us in the importance of love, bravery, and friendship. In a world that often feels disconnected, the film serves as a gentle reminder to embrace our inner child, to find joy in the journey, and to believe in the magic that exists within us all. This film isn't merely an introduction to wizardry; it's an invitation to rediscover wonder.",

In this early installment of JK Rowling saga, our protagonist is freed by Rubeus from the custody of his selfish uncle (Richard Griffiths) and miserable aunt (Fiona Lewis). Harry goes his destiny at Hogwart's school , there meets our friends Ron(Rupert Grint) ,Hermione(Emma Watson) and his enemies Braco Malfoy(Tom Felton), along the dark forces which threatens Hogwart, and finally Lord Voldemor . Besides the professors as Minerva(Maggie Smith), Severus Snape(Alan Rickman), Dumbledore ( Richard Harris), Madame Hooch (Zoe Wanamaker), Quirinus (Ian Hart)and of course Rubeus(Robbie Coltrane). Here some legendary events take place , including a Quiddich match, and Harry Potter competes in confronting in series of dangerous happenings , challenging monsters as unicorn, centaur and horrible creatures and an ending spooky climatic battle .This episode contains loads of adventures and action and is such deeply riveting and emotional as its followings , furthermore gets lots of bombastic special effects and several images have you on the edge of your seat including an amazing array of technical bizarre creatures, a breathtaking ogre ,a three-head animal , and Potter fighting creepy , scary monsters and an exciting final taking on between Harry and the Dark Lord and his henchmen . The picture displays stimulating action set pieces illuminating the full-blown adventures , blending wizardry, witchcraft, horror, humor and is extremely amusing and pretty enjoyable. Darkest even that subsequent chapters is thrilling, dramatic, touching and very exciting. Provide enough amusement to keep the chat rooms humming until the epic ending comes out . In spite of overlong runtime, it suffers from over-length, and the difficult of adapting, the film still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamiliar with the literary and highly detailed work by J. K. Rowling. The motion picture is splendidly filmed with sensational production design and colorful cinematography by John Seale . Phenomenal and spectacular music by master John Williams. The movie is magnificently directed by Chris Colombus . The film is for Harry Potter saga lovers as well as neophyte who have never read J. K. Rowling novels. The follow-up titled ¨Harry Potter and the goblet of fire¨ verse pretty much the same at the first one .",

        "body":"During my childhood, the earlier Harry Potter books got me into the franchise and especially Fantasy Literature in general. They had thought provoking writing, likeable characters, and compelling world building. Then I saw this movie adaptation of The Sorcerer's Stone (The Philosopher's Stone in the UK) back in theaters and loved it. It's not a perfect film I'll admit, but it's a very good start to a successful fantasy movie franchise.Sure, it's a bit overlong and the child performances from Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, while not terrible by any means, could have used some fixing though they did get better as the later movies progressed.Everything else still holds up. The visual effects\/cinematography are beautiful to look at, the directing from Chris Columbus is great, the make up designs are well built, and the music score from John Williams is enchanting and haunting especially Hedwig's Theme. Not to mention the supporting actors are great with Robbie Coltrane as Harris and the late actors Alan Rickman and Richard Harris as Severus Snape and Professor Dumbledore.Overall, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone isn't perfect but it's a very good start to the successful fantasy movie franchise after 20 years. Recommended! :)",

        "body":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first of eight films based on the seven best selling novels by J.K. Rowling. While I certainly don't think it is one of the better films, it is the one that starts them off and crucially it does so in the right way.The tone of the Philosopher's Stone is considerably lighter than the rest of the series. It is quite childish at times and you never really feel there is any danger. That is a problem because in some scenes you probably should feel a threat. The effects in the series overall are fantastic but in this one they are patchy. The troll, fluffy, the quidditch and Voldemort when he appears all look quite cartoonish.The biggest success of the first HP film is the world building. So many fantasy films throw you straight into a complicated, elaborate plot and spend ages trying to explain what is going on. The result is that you never feel like you have been transported into another world. That is what Chris Columbus got right about this one. The plot here feels, for large parts, less important than introducing the world itself. The focus of the film is primarily on the wonder and magic of the world.The sets and locations are fantastic. Hogwarts, Diagon Alley and Gringotts all look great. The costumes are also stunning and give the film a real vibrancy. The soundtrack from John Williams is iconic. The cast features some of the best British and Irish talent from the last half-century and they all give memorable performances. The kids definitely grow into their roles but I had no problem with any of them here.Some of the later films have far more depth, character development and danger about them but they are allowed to because of the foundations laid in this one. When you see Hogwarts, the owls, etc. in the later films you automatically know it is the Harry Potter world and crucially feel a connection to it. That is the Philosopher's Stone's greatest triumph.",

        "body":"I feel, next to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book-to-movie adaptation that I've ever seen. The sets were stunning - the actors were first rate - the effects were breathtaking.  The film flowed quite smoothly in it's transition from page to screen, never tripping on the awkward conventions that other books on film have struggled with.   The screenplay, by Steven Kloves, stripped away all unnecessary elements to get to the root of the story.  Though many events from the book were excluded, the essential ones made it to the film. And it makes for one smooth story and very enjoyable movie-going experience.Many kudos to Chris Columbus and the rest of the Harry Potter cast\/crew for not turning this movie into what it easily could have become:  a 2 and a half hour commercial advertisement for action figures and collectibles, kid's meals and fast food tie-ins, soft drinks and snack products, etc. and instead focused on bringing J.K. Rowling's story to life as accurately and as lovingly as it deserves.  There has been much speculation on whether Columbus was the correct choice for the first two installments of the series and I say to that, Yes.  I feel that he accomplished what most would have failed.  He has proven, at least to me, that Diagon Alley truly exists - if only I could find the right brick to tap on.  The world of Harry Potter is no longer fantasy to me, but instead a place where any of us mere Muggles could hope to visit, one day.One of my favorite moments, is what I'm going to refer to as the Adrenaline Sequence.  By Adrenaline Sequence, I mean the sequence in a movie that for all intents and purposes, doesn't necessarily propel the story, but gives the audience a huge theatrical payoff, ala the Pod Race sequence in The Phantom Menace.  The Adrenaline Sequence for this particular movie is the Quidditch sequence.  I was very happy to finally see the 'hockey\/soccer hybrid on a broomstick' come to life.  The Quidditch Sequence is, by far, my favorite sequence in the whole film.  The scene is dizzying in it's violence and it's one breathless moment after another.  My hat goes off to Columbus and his team for succeeding in making this scene as memorable as it should be.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic movie for children of all ages.  Fans and non-fans alike will enjoy this colorful story of good versus evil and the friendships that endure.",

        "body":"If for nothing else, the Harry Potter films always find a way to give me a great sense of nostalgia. I, like many others, grew up with this franchise. In many ways, this was our generation's Star Wars. It was the 2000's pop culture phenomena. I'm happy to say that the first film, The Sorcerer's Stone, still undoubtedly holds up.I feel like I should first mention just how impressive it is that Warner Bros and their casting directors found the perfect Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Yes, the rest of the film is also impeccably casted with Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, and Tom Felton just to mention a few, but it's the core three characters that carry this franchise. Watching the three of them play off each other so effectively at such a young age is truly awe-inspiring.Granted, heroes are only as good as their villains, and luckily they have a great one in Lord Voldemort. Even though in Sorcerer's Stone it's hard to really call him in the big-bad, considering he's not resurrected yet, but his presence is definitely felt. With that said, I wish they would have involved Professor Quirrell more in the main plot. He's a sketchy guy, but you never get a real sense that he's working to resurrect Voldemort. In fact, he's barely in the movie, so his presence towards the end is unexpected, but I didn't feel like it was earned.But the mishandling of the villain doesn't diminish the tremendous amount of fun The Sorcerer's Stone brings to the young franchise. Chris Columbus does a nice job of setting up all the relationships and characters we will come to love later like Hagrid, Dumbledore, and even Snape. This is clearly focused on the trio, but they each get a chance to chew up some scenery with the young wizards. Everything from a clumsy giant, the dark forest, a game of quidditch, to an important game of chess make The Sorcerer's Stone one of the most memorable entries into the Potter franchise. +The trio are effortlessly cute and entertaining+Pacing+All the beloved characters sprinkled in+Balances a bunch of genres in one-Villain reveal is iffy8.4\/10",

        "body":"Okay I'm gonna say this honestly, I absolutely love this movie. Take in mind that I've read the novels, I'm a big fan and I watched this movie for the first time when I was 10. This is a good adaptation of a great book, but I will say that the only thing that disappoints me now when I watch it is that I can't help, but imagine what it would have been like if JK's first choice of director had been picked (Terry Gilliam). Terry would have definitely been more creative and he probably would have brought something different to the table. I agree with British film critic Mark Kermode, Columbus does have a rather \"bland and straight-forward\" direction style. Now that may work in some movies, but not in a fantasy film like Harry Potter. I must say though in his defense that second movie was much better than the first one, and it seemed to be an improvement for Chris who was probably a lot more comfortable with his surroundings, and had a better relationship with the actors. Still both films are a bit bland in comparison to the rest of the franchise, most of all if we were to compare the first two, to the third one which was directed by the wonderful Alfonso Cuarón, who's style of direction is considerably different from Columbus'. Apart from the blandness the film is great fun for the whole family, and there's always a distinctive energy when you're watching a new HP flick in theaters with a bunch of enthusiastic fans. People are saying now that Twilight is going to replace HP, but I don't think so. The Twilight fan base is only a third of the HP fan base, and the film series is close to been the biggest franchise of all time, and I think they can actually accomplish that. There's great acting by everyone, most of all by the Golden Trio, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and the lovely Emma Watson. Also stand out performances by Maggie Smith as the strict but fair Professor McGonagall, and Alan Rickman as the \"greasy git\", also known as Professor Snape. Richard Harris excels as the Headmaster of Hogwarts Academy, Dumbledore. He plays Harry's mentor to a tee. And I have to say I sorely miss him even if Gambon is doing a great job as his replacement. I just wish Richard would have lived far enough to finish the film series, but I guess you can't get everything you wish for.",

Not to mention that the actors look a lot younger than 11. I felt a bit bored watching it and didn't really enjoy it. Nonetheless, it is Harry Potter, so I will give it a 5.",

Lots of great bits here, like the sorting hat, invisibility cloak, troll encounter, and quidditch match (even if the rules for this game are absurd). The casting is excellent, including the principal three (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) and the teachers at Hogwarts (Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and Richard Harris). The film was a little too long and had scenes that seemed a little disconnected, leading to a rather brief, anticlimactic ending, but overall there's a reason the franchise was so popular, and this got it off the ground in good form.",

        "body":"It's hard to imagine just how influential the Harry Potter series has been on my life. It was released around the time I was born, and I can't really ever remember a time when it wasn't my favorite world to escape into. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first book I can remember becoming a fan of, and wanting to read it again straight away. I'm not even going to pretend that I can judge this without bringing over my fondness for the books.For all the fault this first movie has, it feels like a soon-to-be classic, with many aspects featured here becoming ubiquitous in popular culture. The score by John Williams is recognized worldwide as a magical and wondrous piece of music, conjuring up images of broomsticks, wands, and giant castles hidden in the mountains. Hogwarts Castle itself is now an enormously successful theme park in Florida, Osaka, and more on the way. King's Cross has become a tourist attraction, with hundreds of fans waiting in line to take a picture with the trolley at Platform 9 3\/4 every day.The cast from the very beginning is stock full of British acting royalty, great actors sinking their teeth and relishing every bit of dialogue. The young actors do their best and it's fun to see them start off, knowing what lies ahead for them, both in the course of the series and afterwards as well.The opening sequences have a real sense of mystery and wonder, possibly enhanced by the knowledge of the truth about Harry's real identity. The introductions to characters and places are perfect, most notably: Diagon Alley, Alan Rickman as Snape, and our first glimpse of Hogwarts.The story is simple and mostly an excuse for world-building, but what a world to get lost in. In my head, Hogwarts wasn't so...practical, but it looks like a place a child of 11 would consider the most amazing place in the world. The creatures and rules and spells add to the fun.The film does feature shoddy CGI (the quidditch match is particularly bad) and at 2 and a half hours it is overlong. It's hard to ignore, though, the place in popular culture it has attained and the earnest sense of wonder and fun that it offers to everyone who gives it a chance.",

Our trio of main actors are very young and as a result we get plently of chessey acting. Looking back however it is great too see the beginning roots of the characters that we get very attached too through out the series. We get too see them grow as actors. A great cast was put together that stayed more or less the same through out the whole franchise. The effects in the movie are handled well for its time despite Harry not actually using any magic.

The film has made over 90 million at the box office. Most of the movies were set in U.K and some parts was set in Scotland. The location is true.After reading the book, then you watch the movie, you will find the movie is intriguing.

That all changes one day when he is informed by a man named \"Rebeus Hagrid\" (Robbie Coltrane) that his parents were famous magicians and because of that he is invited to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Needless to say, Harry accepts almost immediately and after Hagrid and he buy the necessary school equipment he begins his journey to the mystical academy. It's then that he meets two fellow students named \"Ron Weasley\" (Rupert Grint) and \"Hermione Granger\" (Emma Watson) who become his good friends and share in his triumphs and travails. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film was based on the very successful book \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" by J.K. Rowling and from what I understand remains quite faithful to the book. At least for the most part. In any case, I found it to be a fine fantasy film with the interaction between Harry and his two friends especially entertaining. Admittedly, there are some slow parts here and there and it does run a bit long (152 minutes). Even so, despite the faults just mentioned, I believe this to be one of those rare movies which can be enjoyed by the entire family and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",

        "body":"I have recently been revisiting the Harry Potter franchise during the ongoing pandemic and I have been wondering whether these movie that I hadn't seen in a decade would have aged well or not. My conclusion is that most of them have aged particularly well and this is especially the case for the first two movies that I consider the best of the franchise. The producers' idea to hire veteran director Chris Columbus was certainly a decisive one in hindsight since he managed to transform a first novel with numerous lengths into an extremely entertaining film for the entire family.The movie has numerous other strengths that need to be pointed out. Even two decades later, the special effects still look stunning and do the great novel series justice. The visual effects are magical, the sound effects are epic and the lighting techniques increase the movie's multiple shifts in atmosphere.The locations have been chosen with care as well. Harry Potter's home looks as boring, desolate and exchangeable as it's described in the novel. The scene at the lighthouse oozes with atmosphere. King's Cross busy Platform 9 3\/4 looks very colourful, detailed and imaginative. The extraordinary train ride to Hogwarts invites to dream yourself far away. The highlight is obviously Hogwarts and its surroundings as nearly every section in this gigantic castle comes around with creative details and imaginative surprises.The film certainly convinces with its detailed storytelling and diversified subplots. It takes all the time it needs to introduce us to numerous most entertaining classes at Hogwarts. The sections that show and explain Harry Potter's Quidditch career are so detailed that even someone who hasn't read the novel will understand how this fascinating wizarding sport works. The film carefully and credibly develops the friendship between lead characters Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Everything is however wrapped up perfectly in an adventurous, entertaining and epic finale where the three protagonists have to face numerous challenges related to the main plot as an impostor is aiming to steal the mysterious Sorcerer's Stone for a most sinister purpose.The young actresses and actors are doing excellent jobs and are truly convincing in their roles. Daniel Radcliffe shines as confused and isolated but soon enough adventurous and imaginative young wizard going through dynamic changes. Rupert Grint excels as friendly but clumsy young wizard who you are going to appreciate right from the start. Emma Watson shines as self-confident, intellectual and slightly arrogant young wizard whose academic performances are incredibly inspiring. The adult actors have also been chosen with care. Richard Harris's performance as principal Albus Dumbledore is the best ever for this role as he convinces as wise, patient and kind mentor that you will like right from the start. My personal highlight is Alan Rickman as cold, gloomy and unpredictable professor who seems to be antagonist and protagonist all at once.In the end, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not only the only movie that I prefer over its novel version in the franchise but also one of the two best movies in the inspiring fantasy film franchise that has left a significant mark on an entire generation of children and teenagers two decades ago. The film has aged quite well and should still impress children and teenagers as well as their parents all around the world nowadays. The movie has been executed with care in every single department and has lost nothing of its unique charm. It would go as far to state that it stands as one of the very best fantasy movies of the twenty-first century.",

This film redeems itself above other sorcery films with its old fashioned English ambiance being greater than arch and portentous fantasy.Unlike other fantasy films the directors face the challenge of a highly critical audience of children who are more familiar with the books that they are & waiting expectantly for their favorite part of the book and would tear the director to ices if he was there in their anger such omissions. Any changes in the film would be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. In the production of the first film this was a contention in preproduction. As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done as far as special effects go. The actors although experienced are let down by the younger cast not being trained and coming from a stage school background with the exception of the lead show the typical stiltedness of such training. Daniel Radcliffe has been accused of being too subdued in the title role but as he becomes older he character does become more sombre. Alos it allows the other characters oddities to shine more clearly in contrast to his quieter style.",

He becomes friends with Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). It doesn't take long for Potter to learn about his past as well as what's expected of him in the future.I'm going to be really honest and admit that I've never read a single line of any of the novels and in all honesty I never really paid too much attention to what they were even about. I'm watching this first film on March 15, 2016 so that's nearly fifteen years since this was released so obviously you can't say I'm a fan of anything involving the characters. I really wasn't sure what to expect going into the movie but by the time the end credits started there's no doubt that I was left entertained.I thought for the most part this was a pretty entertaining film and I think everyone got it right in regards to the casting. I mean the three leads are all extremely good for their roles and I thought all of them managed to help carry the film. Radcliffe was certainly believable in the role of this master wizard and I thought both Grint and Watson added a lot of charm. Then you've got the likes of John Cleese, Alan Rickman, John Hurt, Maggie Smith and Richard Harris.I'm not normally a fan of CGI heavy movies but I thought it was perfectly used here and never really took away from the story. Instead of taking away from the story it actually did a very good job at adding to this alternative universe and the various magic that is to be found in it. Technically speaking the film was certainly well made with a ripping score, great effects as well as fine editing and cinematography. If I had to say anything negative about the picture it would be the incredibly long running time.",

My opinion of the first two in this series (Godzilla and Godzilla: King of the Monsters) is that they were (somewhat) reality based and not obviously made for children. My criticism of G v K (the ending in particular) and this movie is that so much of it is far-fetched and fantasy based. Much more cartoonish.The bottom line is, they're making the monsters out to have too much human intelligence when they should actually be more animalistic. This was like watching a superhero movie and in my opinion, making the monsters out to be superheroes is a huge mistake. That's what happened when Toho did this in the 60's\/70's which resulted in Godzilla movies becoming silly, low-budget kids movies, which has since been ridiculed for decades and has tarnished Godzilla's image. I understand the writers are trying to be creative and give the fans something different from all of the other monster movies out there, but this can be done without all the cheese.

Luckily, I wasn't disappointed, I got everything what I expected which might be summoned by the two equations above.About humans:\nIf you want to watch the movie at home, don't waste time on humans subplot. It's completely pointless. The dialogues aren't funny or smart. They serve poor exposition which is painfully exhausting to watch. You see the monsters fighting and these \"characters\" are explaining in between: oh, he is protecting! - Come on, who wrote this? In my opinion if Legendary Studios wants to include humans, they should at least try making them just little interesting or just remove them completely. None of them is doing anything necessary, furthermore whatever they're doing doesn't make any sense. Why the hell are they in the Hollow Earth without protection? One guy is just in a Hawaiian shirt. The amount of dangerous monsters is not alarming, I guess... Paper Boy is filming everything but the British guy in a Hawaiian shirt says something like: It's better to keep it in a secret, this ancient civilization shouldn't be exposed to our world. The girl from Godzilla Vs. Kong (she is from that world and has weird X-Men power (?)) is among modern people, so the world already knows the underground world. What does he want to hide? There is more of this stupidity.About the monsters:\nKong is the lead. His journey is simple, he feels lonely, he wants to have a family of his kind. From the trailers you know, there is more giant apes, so I am happy to see them because I am Team Kong :) I'd want to appreciate the \"dialogues\" between Kong and this little ginger fella. They don't use words as we do but believe me, these two are more interesting than the humans. You will enjoy it.Godzilla and the rest are just monsters. Sadly Godzilla isn't intimidating in this movie, his only goal is to gain the pink level of nuclear power and then use it to fight the bad monkey. However, the fight scenes are awesome - this is why we are watching this type of movies, so if you're a fan of giant monsters, I recommend Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire... and don't expect to see raise of \"the new empire\" in this movie.

The movie is filled with monkeys throughout, making it more like an independent Kong film because it barely depicts Godzilla, with Kong having far more screen time than Godzilla. I feel like Godzilla's role was forcefully added and feels disconnected from the rest of the movie. Also, the portrayal of SHIMO is superficial, failing to showcase its power, while Skar King is portrayed as a clown; it can't even defeat King Kong one-on-one, lacking a strong antagonist that leads to a rushed conclusion of the final battle.

Adam Wingard's second Monsterverse film following 2021's \"Godzilla vs Kong\" delivers satisfying Titan action, but overall, the film feels like a step back, largely owing to dull and tedious human drama.Personally, I found \"Godzilla vs Kong\" to be the best Monsterverse film. It embraced the absurdity and silliness of its premise and made the most of it to deliver one hell of a show, placing the Titans front and centre, while jettisoning any unnecessary human drama. \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" starts off much slower, with the actual plot taking nearly 20 minutes to kick in. Combined with an uptick in uninteresting human drama, this slows down the movie with certain portions feeling boring.Much like its predecessor, \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" struggles trying to the connect the stories of the two leading titans. Kong is the heart and soul of the movie, with Godzilla largely feeling like an accomplice or sidekick. The first half of the movie is almost entirely about Kong's exploration of Hollow Earth, the subterranean ecosystem where the Titans live. While learning about the mystical world was engaging and intriguing, it lead to a delayed introduction of the villain, leading to the third act feeling slightly rushed and less rewarding compared to the enthralling finale of \"Godzilla vs Kong\".The action sequences themselves are a whole lot of fun, with a face off in hollow earth with gravity slightly messed-up being one of my favourites of the entire franchise. The finale in Rio delivers plentiful excitement and fun too.\"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" is best suited for fans of the Showa era. For Kong fans(like myself), there is a lot to like about the movie, owing to the humanisation of the great ape. The action scenes are fun, colourful and campy, similar to it's predecessor, but an increased focus on human characters and a slower pace make this a slightly underwhelming entry to the Monsterverse.",

And lastly, the Titans were back to being the bad guys instead of humans. I always find it a bore when you watch a movie about monsters fighting, but have to bare through a story of human villains and their idiotic ideologies.A side note, it's hilarious that these Titans seem to really enjoy having their royal rumbles in the biggest cities on the planet, or while destroying some of the world's most revered structures.

        "body":"This movie has a real problem - It tries to cater to a wider audience by adding more 'Marvel type' action and storytelling rather than focus on doing what it could do really well and appeal to a more niche audience.The \"doing what it could do well\" part I am referring to is the BIGNESS of the Kaiju's \/ monsters. Not just their actions but their presence and size.. a bit of slowness in how they walk and move, to feel that \"thud\" when they take a step and the sheer overwhelming presence that they represent - Like in Pacific Rim or in Godzilla King of the Monsters. You FEEL the bigness and the size.A splash in the ocean can causes huge tide-waves due to the size.A resounding BOOM that is felt when two Kaiju's collide.Where is that?There is no respect paid to the bigness.It's just they took some superhero action sequences and applied them to giants and made them move like they were the same size as humans.There is no FEEL or BIGNESS - It's simply a 6 out of 10 movie because it caters \"enough\" to enough people because it goes for what's popular and throws a lot of it while giving away the depth and the \"feel\" of a big monster movie that is what godzilla is meant to be.",

Human characters exist only to remind us of long forgotten cliches and definitely not of characters. Destroying the cultural and historical heritage of mankind is order of a day. And in all that there's nowhere in the site possibility of simple 'just sit back and enjoy the rid'. What an insulting mess of corporate idiocy...

It's essentially a very forgettable monster mashup that aims for the heights of the epic and terrifying; but instead serves an OTT nonstop chest-beating slugfest, smothered in tawdry CGI. It's overpowered monster WWE seemingly presented as something the filmmakers *believe* or estimate an audience will like; as if it were the product of a soulless spreadsheet.These tired titans of bygone cinema have been pulled back into the limelight as the viewer suffers a nowhere-plot aimed at the lowest common denominator. The Kaiju terror is here, but in a very watered-down state.No dialogue because it's just senseless roaring beasts? Don't need to pay anyone to write a good script. Excessive closeups of the beasts all the time? Well that handily means they didn't need to animate higher-budget complex scenes from a more interesting POV. Sensory overload to distract the viewer from the complete lack of actual substance? Check. The corner-cutting is so apparent the more you look; the buck is passed onto the consumers who continue to accept this poor standard of filmmaking time and time again.4\/10.",

My biggest problem with it, was the human characters. Just like \"Godzilla vs Kong\", the characters are flat and i would rather watch monsters fight than them.The direction by Adam Wingard is pretty good. The action in particulat is really well done and you can really see what's going on.The actors were OK for the most part but for the script they are given, they are fine.Giant praise to the VFX. Everything looked amazaing and you can see that the money went in the place, not like \"Captain Marvel 2\" for example, which had a 300 million dollar budget and for the money, it looked awful.The music is good too. I wouldn't buy a soundtrack but it served the story.Overall if you just want to have fun for 2 hours, this movie is perfect.",

My expectations were kind of meh, me personally, Godzilla Vs Kong (GVK) was OKAY, nothing special, maybe about a 6\/10So who won this time in Godzilla X Kong & what is this New Empire?... well legendary studios of course!After a victorious achievement for Toho... we all know what we've come for here at legendary studios, & the results are definitely not a minus one...because this time we up the ante, and the people have spoken, we want this, legendary in this film is simply unlocking the massive cheese vault oozing into my optic stems, Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire is a hyper adrenaline rush energizer, it felt like my brain waves digested a high voltage energy drink kicking every inch of my brain cells.Dan Stevens is a solid comic relief along with Brian Tyree Henry. The jokes land a bit better this time around. The aura & creative decisions in this film have almost an 80's vintage vibrant feel, the music & color palette compliment each other perfectly along with cinematography.My issues? Well... why does the movie have Monarch being okay with bringing anybody down to hollow earth? Reliance on slight jumpy exposition, small things that could have been explored a little more to leave more an impact. It's not perfect for those, however I will argue this film was a lot closer to striking close to being perfect than you would think a film of this caliber could do.This is what happens when Cinematography, awareness, consistency & finding the footing on following Kaijus, gets the best of a cinematic experience, it's just as much a kaiju story as it is a human story & It's a Love Letter to the showa era & fans should be proud.I've never been more invested in the actual story of the kaijus until this movie, expositions & humans don't ruin it either this time. It's not anything special, but what is special are what we are here for, & that's the Kaijus.New Empire, by far, has the longest showtime for Kaiju action that I've ever seen in a monster flick. Beautifully shot cinematic camera scenes, there is one specific upside down shot unfolding to the right side up, just amazing cameraworkThe gradual building blocks embedded in the story left exciting awe in entertainment & care of handling Kaiju moments. The humans are just enhancers for the monsters. Compared to GVK, they have a better direction here without getting lost.It's a ride, took the issues of GVK & corrected it more, there's plenty of action if not more than you'd think... there's plenty of surprises, emotional character moments with humans\/monsters, & although a not so perfect expositions still a solid fun plot\/story following the elements at play... Godzilla X Kong was a lot better than I thought it was going to be & that's worth something.7.5 \/ 10.",

Yeah they had humans, but they were mostly more of a footnote in the story, which could have been almost completely told without the humans, but they did add a little flavour to the mix. Especially Dan Stevens. But then I AM kinda biased towards him as I've loved his work in everything I've seen him in so far.All that aside, Kong was great - and MASSIVE - and Godzilla was pretty damn impressive, too - and just as massive as Kong - but more than that, we got a look at a few other Titans as well, and they were ALL pretty impressively brought to life here. My ONLY gripe about Kong himself is that, in the early going the filmmakers tried to humanise him just that little but too much, and it kinda fell flat to me.

        "body":"Wow, just wow. Now the thing is, the reason I am saying wow, is for a few big reasons that can probably relate to a lot of regular humans like me because I am most definitely human and not Godzilla trying to promote his own film. The reasons being; CGI, Big monster go rahh, and epic battle scenes. Anything else is boring and I frankly could care less about in this film because it affects nothing and all I care about are the things that THE FILM IS ACTUALLY ABOUT (humans).First, I wanna start off by saying that comparing this film's CGI to Godzilla Minus One (greatest Godzilla film that actually made me care about humans), budget wise, is like an insult. GMO had a budget near abouuuut 20 million or so, while GXK had 10x the budget. GMO managed to achieve winning an Oscar with 100x less visual art employees and having the best and probably the most realistic large scale CGI I've seen ever. BUT, the CGI even with such a smaller film beating it, is still excellent as always and doesn't look like some PS5 game that was reprogrammed to run on a Nintendo Switch, unlike other films. It has definitely been one of the consecutive aspects of the MonsterVerse.Monsters; I'm a sucker for Godzilla, not so much Kong, but this version of him definitely catches my eye. Godzilla and Shimo were what really brought this film together, and the funny thing is, before I saw Godzilla with pink atomic breath, it was my most disliked color, but on him, it's my preferred look for him. I also already loved cold related things so a big beast like Shimo definitely made me see this film.Battle Scenes. Now I know, I know, not all Godzilla films can entirely be epic fight scenes, I'M JUST SAYING, I wish they were longer. They are definitely what everyone, including me, came to see, and I am beyond glad with the outcome of the film, that I totally didn't see coming (that's sarcasm), and I actually would love to see more of the franchise, whatever it may be. Also to anyone who disliked the movement speed of Godzilla, watch literally any dated Godzilla film.In summary, I love Godzilla, Dune Part Two and GMO still beat it by an inconceivable number, but if you like big monsters or just Godzilla in General, watch this, maybe watch it again, or just watch the fight scene clips.",

Director Adam Wingard has adopted this approach when making this film, but on this occasion very little that is being randomly tossed about actually sticks. The smackdowns between the film's creatures are loud, frantic and reasonably fun, but the plot is a sloppy turd of Titan proportions -- a stinky, contrived, overblown mess brought to life in a maelstrom of not very convincing CGI.The script is absolutely terrible, and the majority of the film had me either scratching my head in confusion or laughing at its preposterousness. Kong being equipped with a metal fist is an undeniably cool idea, but the fact that the protagonists just happen to have such a device on hand in Hollow Earth is just crazy (especially one with built in anti-frostbite serum!). A vet who knows how to extract a Kong tooth also knows how to fly a Hollow Earth hover ship -- clearly a man of many talents. God only knows what the Iwi tribe were up to with their glowing pyramids. What was the deal with that glowing spike that nasty ape used to control the ice lizard? And why did everyone suddenly start floating around in Hollow Earth? (there might have been explanations for some of these points, but they became lost in all of the chaos).After Godzilla Minus One, I suggest leaving all future films featuring the big lizard to the Japanese.3.5\/10, rounded down to 3 for Kaylee Hottle's perpetually anxious look -- doesn't the girl have any other expressions?",

Now, don't get me wrong, because I have thoroughly and genuinely enjoyed the recent movies, by all means, but they were not really outstanding.And then director Adam Wingard brought \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" to the table. Holy Monster Bash, Batman, what a phenomenal surprise of a movie this turned out to be. I have to say that I was blown away by this movie, and I had not seen a movie of this magnitude making its appearance. I was fully and wholly entertained throughout the course of the 115 minutes that the movie ran for.The storyline in \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\", as written by Terry Rossio, Simon Barrett, Jeremy Slater and Adam Wingard, is pretty straightforward. But what works here, in comparison to the many previous newer Godzilla and\/or King Kong movies, was that this movie was all amount Titans fighting one another, and the human storylines were mere backdrops. That worked so well for me, because the insane amount of action in terms of Titans fighting throughout the course of the movie, was amazing. And it made the movie work on such a great level for me. Seeing Godzilla and King Kong fighting, or either of them fighting other Titans, now that is why I sit down to watch movies such as this. And, oh boy, did director Adam Wingard deliver her.The acting performances in the movie are good, and I have to say that I wasn't really overly familiar with any of the actors or actresses on the cast list. Sure, I've seen some of them before, but am not all that familiar with their previous work. Kaylee Hottle (playing Kia) and Fala Chen (playing the Iwi Queen) definitely put on memorable performances with their characters.Something that is important for a monster bash movie such as \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" are special effects. And wow. I was beyond amazed here. The CGI in the movie is phenomenal, and it looks so great and realistic. And the sheer amount of mayhed and destruction throughout the course of the movie almost had me cheering in the cinema. This is definitely the most intense Kaiju movie (or Titans as they are called in this movie) I have ever seen. And that alone makes it more than well-worth sitting down to watch \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\".\"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" is how Kaiju (or Titan) movies are supposed to be. And this particular movie from director Adam Wingard was simply amazing. This is a movie that I strongly and warmly recommend you to go watch. Do it in the cinema, because the sounds of the Titans roaring and battling is so well-worth getting shook through from the cinema speakers. I loved that about the movie as well.I am a fan of this movie, no doubt about it. And when I walked out of the cinema, it was with a big 'wow, are you kidding me' feel. Because Adam Wingard's 2024 movie \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" was over-the-top and exactly how such a movie should be.My rating of \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" lands on a rock-solid nine out of ten stars.",

Tell Bryan Cranston's dying wife that the world will be safe because a giant super hero monkey with a transformers arm will team up with a caped crusder lizard to kung fu fight monsters, and the earth is hollow and has a giant monkey city in it, then come back and tell me how well that fits together as part of the same \"universe\". \"Monkey hits lizard, good , don't say otherwise or me throw poop at you!\" If that's your level of intelligence you will love it, but don't watch it or you will get worse. Please don't defend this movie by asking us to \"TURN OUR BRAIN OFF\", if that's your defense you already lost the deabate, why don't you ask the writers to turn their brain on? \"FUN\" is not synonymous of \"STUPID\", it wasn't, it doesn't have to be, and we already passed that, oh that's right \"-1\" wasn't Hollywood... here we go again... OF COURSE ITS FAIR TO COMPARE IT WITH \"-1\", every movie with dinosaurs is still compared to Jurassic Park, people can compare it with Barbie or the Smurfs if they want, but this one doesn't even stand a comparison with GODZILLA 2014 which is part of the NOT MARVEL \"universe\" it belongs, and its the one has to be mandatory compared to. Don't turn off your brain for Hollywood again, enough is enough. This movie is to GODZILLA 2014 what BATMAN AND ROBIN was to BATMAN 1989 AND BATMAN RETURNS or what Moonraker was to James Bond. They started as something believable and serious and someone else turned them later into goofy cartoons. Being a fan of GODZILLA and tokusatsu cinema and tv doesn't mean that I cannot distinguish quality from trash, and as a healthy fan I always want QUALITY, NOT QUANTITY, I don't consume and blindly deffend everything because it says \"Godzilla\" on it. Yes, the Showa era exists, Toho is embarrased of it, any fan knows that, do you? They consider it as the lowest point of the franchise and that's why Godzilla has never been that goofy; at least in Japan, ever since. BUT This is NOT a Showa era Godzilla movie, its supposed ti part of the serious american Godzilla 2014 version, which exists because the American 1998 version was so terrible and goofy that they decided to scratch all sequels and reboot it in a serious direction with the 2014 version. But 1998's was more believable than this new one, why is 1998 not equaly praised? The Showa era; as goofy as it was, was its OWN thing(mess) separatted from the original's canon, Godzilla has been reseted in Japan at least 3 times, but this ultra goofy american cartoon is NOT its own thing, it is supposed to be a CONTINUATION of a movie where Bryan Cranston, crying with a broken soul, had to sacrifice his wife and colleagues to save the city and his son, and he had to say goodbye while she was dying in front of him, a movie where they tried to give weight and REALISM to a creature of more than 300m height and thousands of tons in weight, where they tried to put on screen the consequences of its destruction and existence in the REAL world. That was the selling point, realism, that was what was promised to the fans, it delivered that promise but not as well as GODZILLA-1 did, yet it was a stept on the right direction, how did we get from that 2014 movie to this? How is that a progress? Goofy movies are fun and have their space in cinema, a bigger place than what they deserve, no doubt of that, I love \"so bad are good movies\" as much as the next man BUT.....BUT.....but I repeat, that is when they ARE THEIR OWN THING and not a continuation of something that was relatively realistic and serious. And this one goes an extra mille triplying down with stupidity which makes it insulting to even kids intellligence. After so many times complaining about studios telling us to \"turn off our brain\" when did you, the raging fans decided to obey and celebrate that? Have some integrity! GODZILLA-1 and everything from Nolan prove that movies can be intelligent and entertaining at the same time again, no excuse! Specially GODZILLA-1 reminded us 4 important things:\n1 - You can have an intelligent, engaging, and even inspiring story and visual spectacle at the same time. Thay they cannot exist together is an old lazy writers' lie.2 - People do like human characters, when they are well writen and important for the plot. These movies dont work without them, they are the ones that suffer the consequences of the destruction and as the audirnce we need that.3 - Millions of dollars on visual efects are worth nothing if points 1 and 2 are not checked.4 - Not everything has to ripp off of MARVEL.If you are a filmmaker who loves bad dumb movies create your own franchise and quit destroying others with continuations that are not even part of the same genre! Does Jar Jar Binks fits in The Godfather's \"universe\" (everything has to be called a universe now, thanks to Marvel)? Cake on face jokes? I didn't think so neither.IF you as most fans have complained of movies for being shallow, dumb and for treating the audience as \"stupid cattle\", but you deffend this movie precisely for being all that, don't you dare to trash Batman and Robin, Transformers, anything from Michael Bay, Uwe Boll, Fast and Furious, Jurassic World, sharknado, Birdemic, The Room, again, because that's called DOUBLE STANDARDS. TURN YOUR BRAIN BACK ON. This movie is terrible and that's NOT A GOOD THING.",

Despite not being able to speak, Kong steals the movie with his facial expressions. The humans are merely a sideshow.{BTW, the 9-star review \"Monsters can tell a story w\/o human dialogue\" is worth a read}Personally, I think showing Kong's surprisingly dreary existence in what was supposedly the monster-paradise of Hollow Earth was nicely done. For example, we see him fighting a bunch of reptiles, and he rips one body in half over his head, covering himself in green goo (and roaring) to scare the remaining attackers away. This works, but you can clearly see his subsequent thought process (via body language): \"Great. Now I have to find a waterfall to wash all this gunk off. Ugh.\" Plus, he has a toothache that's very painful -- he can't even enjoy eating what he kills. His life basically sucks.Of course there's WAY more than that going on, but other reviews cover that.So while the story is complete hokum, it's done so earnestly that I can overlook that. I often subtract one star for movies that seem forgettable, but not here -- my gears are still turning a day later.I give this seven (7) stars for entertainment value.",

The film doesn't disappoint in this aspect, as the fight sequences are incredibly well-executed and visually stunning, capturing the raw power and scale of these colossal creatures.What sets this film apart is its ability to balance the spectacle of the monster battles with a decent plot that keeps the audience invested. While it may not break new ground in terms of storytelling, the plot serves its purpose by providing enough context and stakes to drive the action forward. It effectively sets the stage for the epic clash between the monsters, making their confrontation feel earned and impactful.One of the standout aspects of the film is its breathtaking visual effects. The CGI is top-notch, seamlessly blending the massive creatures into their environments and delivering jaw-dropping action sequences that truly immerse the audience in the epic battle between the Titans. From the destruction of cityscapes to the intricate details of the monsters themselves, the VFX work is nothing short of astonishing.After watching \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,\" I'm left wanting more. The film delivers on its promise of entertainment, offering a thrilling cinematic experience that leaves a lasting impression. I'm already looking forward to revisiting the movie and eagerly anticipating future installments that continue to deliver the same level of excitement and spectacle.

Aside from Godzilla (2014), they range from mediocre to terrible. And GxK is no different.I know most reviews will compare this to Godzilla Minus One. But I have to. Every single Godzilla shot from Minus One is better than every single shot of him in GxK. Every single action scene in Minus One is better than every single one in GxK. Better story, characters, dialogue, emotional investment. Everything. Minus One is better in every way.The worst thing I can say about GxK is... I was so bored. And I didn't care about anything that was happening. Zero investment. This is partly because it doesn't really have a story. Stuff just happens. Halfway through, I still didn't know what the story was about, what conflict we might be heading to, any kind of build up of a threat.They continue with another useless human plot, completely formulaic and bland. One of the only positives is a highly talented cast. They're just not given anything to work with. Rebecca Hall is the only one who gets to show her talent.Even worse is the 50+ comedic attempts. I laughed twice. The nearly sold out crowd laughed a few times. The rest made me cringe. They're like dad jokes. The entirety of the human story is basically a kids movie.What about the titans? They rarely show the scale of these monsters. Most of the time it's from the perspective of the monsters, not the humans. So they always look like they're 6 feet tall, with everything around just smaller.Even the movements are so fast like humans are fighting. When they fall, they fall in a second. No ground-shaking impact. It feels so fake and nowhere close to epic. I'm not anti-CGI, but the big action scenes are hectic gibberish.I give up. It shouldn't be this difficult. I don't even need it to be a \"good\" movie. Just entertaining with good action. Instead I get forgettable and dumb.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 3\/28\/2024)",

The film's narrative dives into the discovery of a new threat emerging from the Hollow Earth, prompting Godzilla and Kong to team up once more to defend the surface world.The story unfolds with a fast-paced urgency as ancient secrets are unearthed and new monstrous adversaries rise. While the plot is undeniably engaging, it occasionally feels rushed, lacking the depth and development that could have elevated the film from great to exceptional. Some story arcs could have benefitted from more screen time to fully flesh out the intriguing mythology that surrounds these legendary creatures.Despite this, the cast delivers stellar performances across the board. Rebecca Hall returns alongside Brian Tyree Henry and Kaylee Hottle ensuring that the human element of the story remains strong amidst the colossal battles. Dan Stevens also makes an appearance as Trapper, a pretty fun and interesting character.The true stars, however, are the VFX and SFX teams. The visual effects are nothing short of spectacular, bringing the titans and their world to life with breathtaking detail and realism. The sound design amplifies every roar and explosion, immersing the audience in the heart-pounding action. The sheer scale and spectacle of the monster battles are awe-inspiring, making every clash a visual feast.Overall Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire earns a solid 7\/10 from me. The film boasts a fantastic cast and phenomenal VFX and SFX, ensuring a thrilling cinematic experience. While the story could have benefitted from more nuanced development, the movie's strengths more than make up for its shortcomings.

We open with the uneasy alliance between Godzilla and Kong, tasked with protecting humanity from lurking threats. However, whispers of a hidden danger soon tear this fragile peace apart, dragging our ape and atomic lizard into a clash for survival.The film's biggest strength lies in its breathtaking visuals. The battles between Godzilla and Kong are undeniably impressive. Director Adam Wingard stages these showdowns with a chaotic energy, taking us from the neon-drenched streets of Hong Kong to the gravity-defying caverns of Hollow Earth. The special effects are top-notch, with both titans rendered in stunning detail. Godzilla's atomic blasts illuminate the screen, while Kong swings through the air with a balletic grace that belies his immense size.Unfortunately, the impressive visuals can't mask the film's narrative shortcomings. The plot feels cobbled together, relying on tired tropes and predictable twists. The human characters, once again relegated to monster movie peanut gallery duty, are given little to work with. There's a valiant effort to establish a connection between Kong and a newfound ape companion in Hollow Earth, but it's underdeveloped and ultimately inconsequential. Meanwhile, bland dialogue and clichéd motivations make it hard to care about their fate.The pacing is another culprit. The film lurches between slow, exposition-heavy stretches and frenetic action sequences. The editing feels choppy at times, leaving some fight choreography confusing and hard to follow. The score by Tom Holkenborg (Junkie XL) is a mixed bag. While it boasts some pulse-pounding tracks during the fights, it lacks the thematic depth or memorable motifs that truly elevate a monster movie.Godzilla x Kong: The New Kong Empire feels like a missed opportunity. It evokes memories of classic monster brawls but fails to capture the spirit of what made them special. While Kaiju fans might find some enjoyment in the big-budget slugfests, the film ultimately disappoints with its forgettable story, underdeveloped characters, and uneven execution. If you're looking for a monster movie masterpiece, look elsewhere. This one's best left on Skull Island.",

In fairness it picked up towards the end though.A signal coming from somewhere within the Hollow Earth causes Godzilla to begin to strengthen himself for an upcoming battle. Within Hollow Earth, Kong unwitting reveals a deeper level, that was previously sealed off and within that level are other giant apes, ruled over by a tyrannical king Skar. Kong challenges Skar but is wounded in a losing effort. Desperate he heads to the surface to convince Godzilla to join him in the battle.That all sounds pretty exciting I know, but its all belaboured by a relatively boring middle section, that we spend with the human characters, exploring the Hollow Earth. The humans themselves are actually pretty good. Dan Stevens is great in everything and he's having a lot of fun here. He has good chemistry with lifelong friend Rebecca Hall and with Bryan Tyree Henry, both of whom are reprising their roles from \"Godzilla vs. Kong\". Still though their voyage through Hollow Earth is lacking in peril, or excitement. (Whilst we're here, the \"Monarch\" TV series established that time moves much slower in Hollow Earth than it does on the outside world - a fact that this film ignores entirely.)It does, as you might imagine, pick up for a zero gravity multi-Titan battle that takes place leading into the films climax. From that moment on I was engaged with the film and enjoyed it through to the ending.I don't know how helpful it is to compare this with \"Godzilla Minus One\" as despite sharing the same character, they have very different objectives in the stories they tell.

Then there are apes, Wakanda people inside hollow Earth with great CG technologies and do nothing. Seems this movie ain't made for watching but to put cool lights on silver screen.We have few human characters as well. Protagonist, wisdom girl, cool white guy, compulsory funny black guy and one guy supposed to die about which no body cares. So all these characters go on a simple mission which turns out to be existential threat to earth so these people watch a bunch of monsters fight until credits roll.",

        "body":"As a long-time fan of monster movies, I eagerly anticipated the release of \"Kong and Godzilla: The New Empire,\" hoping for a thrilling showdown between these iconic titans. Unfortunately, the film falls short on nearly every front, delivering a lackluster experience that left me more frustrated than entertained.First and foremost, the plot is a convoluted mess. The story feels cobbled together from cliches and lacks any real coherence. The attempt to weave in human drama feels forced and unnecessary, detracting from the monsters that should be the stars of the show. Instead of focusing on the epic battles, we are subjected to tedious subplots involving forgettable human characters who add nothing of value to the narrative.Speaking of battles, the film's action sequences are surprisingly dull. One would expect a film featuring Kong and Godzilla to be packed with jaw-dropping, edge-of-your-seat moments, but what we get are poorly choreographed fights that lack any real sense of danger or excitement. The special effects, while decent, are not enough to save these uninspired confrontations.The performances from the human cast are mediocre at best. It's evident that even talented actors struggled with the poorly written dialogue and shallow character development. Their motivations are unclear, and their actions often defy logic, making it difficult to invest in their fates.Additionally, the pacing of the film is atrocious. At over two hours, it drags painfully, with long stretches where nothing of significance happens. The movie's climax, which should be the highlight, feels rushed and anticlimactic, leaving much to be desired.In terms of visual and audio elements, \"Kong and Godzilla: The New Empire\" does have some redeeming qualities. The CGI is generally well-executed, and the monster designs are impressive. However, these aspects alone cannot compensate for the film's many shortcomings.In conclusion, \"Kong and Godzilla: The New Empire\" is a major disappointment. It fails to capture the magic and excitement that made previous entries in the franchise enjoyable. With a nonsensical plot, lackluster action, and forgettable characters, this film is a chore to sit through. Save your time and money; this empire is not worth visiting.",

        "body":"Having never seen the original Japanese series of Godzilla movies, I only have a loose sense of their progression from serious to silly. I've seen random clips that I couldn't take seriously, but I also know some of the first films in the franchise were a grim analogy of nuclear war. While Godzilla Minus One (2023) nailed the serious side of Godzilla, the Monsterverse movies have steadily been drifting toward unhinged territory. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire (2024) is merely the latest proof.There were so many things going on in this movie, it felt like a shotgun approach to see if anything would stick. It was a bit frustrating that the headliner, Godzilla, barely appeared until the third act. The humans were even more caricature-like than previous entries, and I hardly cared about their stories or struggles. When the universe can support any random thing happening, the whole thing ultimately becomes less grounded in reality. Not that these movies were ever truly grounded in reality, but the better ones didn't suspend my disbelief nearly as much.Despite the criticism, though, The New Empire had its fun moments of monster mayhem. I wished there were more of them, but the ones we got were well worth the price of admission. Of course, Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) started this trend toward the silliness in this film. You can only really do it seriously once before the plot demands you add in pink energy crystals or cyborg prosthetics for a gigantic ape. As a popcorn flick, I could definitely turn my brain off and just enjoy the CGI carnage. Just don't think about it too hard.A Monsterverse film sliding further into \"silly\" territory, I give Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire 3.0 stars out of 5.",

Both came out at the same time but that was significantly better in my opinion and made for a fraction of the cost. Now i get that this is fantasy but I hate my constant eye rolling thinking that this is nonsense. Aren't we supposed to feel something for the people were watching. They all act like divs half the time and have the emotional depth of a budgie. I often get to the end of the film feeling disapointed they didn't all die like the clearly should do.",

This movie is an emotional roller coaster, blending extremely exciting action with touching bonds and epic team ups.Suko, Kong's loyal companion who is like a son to him, steals a spotlight for me, he is so cute and shows his loyalty and affection towards Kong. Godzilla's and Kong's eventual team up is what we all wanted for so many years!!! For these two iconic titans to fight together against Skar King and one other formidable foe.The introduction of the main antagonist of the movie, Skar King is very interesting, I really like the concept of this antagonist as he will bring some emotions to the character as well which is very interesting for a titan to have such human like behavior, and also adds a whole new layer of excitement to the movie with later putting one of the best monster battles ever brought from a movie.But whats truly sets this movie apart is its heart. Amidst the chaos and destruction of the epic monster battles, there are moments of pure emotion between the titans and the humans, and what brings \"The New Empire\" is the new bonds that were made between the characters for me.This is by far the best addition to the Monsterverse yet, it has all that we asked for and its truly a masterpiece, thank you Legendary, This will probably be one of my favorite movies ever made!!!

        "body":"Really wanted to like this. The previous trilogy is excellent, and I'd even say it's one of the best genre trilogies ever made (LOTR is #1, of course). Dawn is especially a masterpiece of intelligent sci-fi adventure spectacle, a movie that is both exciting and intelligent. The entire trilogy is emotionally engaging and Caesar is an incredible lead.Unfortunately, this film doesn't have any characters as good as Caesar. In fact, it feels like a lesser retread of the same ideas and themes of the previous trilogy. There's nothing really new here. You've already seen a better version of this movie before.With that said, let me get the good out of the way first. The cinematography is excellent. The visual effects are still incredible, both as a technical and artistic achievement. The first 45 minutes of the film are really solid. There's a lot of good visual storytelling in the opening act.However, once we meet the main antagonist, things kinda fall apart. The pacing is off. Some scenes drag, while major character moments feel rushed. There's a friction between two major characters that doesn't feel earned, especially since the characters kinda come to an understanding, and then a few scenes later they are butting heads. What could and should have been an interesting dynamic feels incomplete, like entire scenes were cut out.The main antagonist could have been really cool. The idea of a cult-like warlord obsessed with human history, there's so much they could have done with that idea. But he simply doesn't have enough scenes to really make him anything more than Koba Part II. And Koba had better motivations and more complexity. None of the characters here are as well written as the previous trilogy and the last 10 minutes feel more like a TV finale than a movie.Oh, and the music score is pretty generic and forgettable. Really disappointing, because I love the music from the other movies. Caesar's theme is so good. Nothing here comes close.Anyway... Kingdom is far from terrible, but to quote another major franchise with a movie coming out May 2024: \"Mediocre!\"",

A classic hero's journey through the remnants of this universe's apocalyptic landscape is a great idea, but the journey itself is just devoid of sauce. It's bland, and often just feels like we're watching scenes checking off boxes from an adventure story. Like a movie coming out of an assembly line. Character motivations are unclear, the mc's emotional arc is unclear, and overall every idea just doesn't feel fleshed out, even when they almost have a good one. How Caesar's legacy is handled in this movie is almost interesting, but again it is not fleshed out. I will say the movie starts strong, I didn't really start turning on it til I realized how bored I was about halfway through. And that's before the third act really just frustrated me. Almost feels like we're seeing the first draft of a potentially great movie. Still excited to see where the franchise goes, but this new set of movies is off to a rough start for me.",

The film shines with its impressive special effects and CGI, which bring the apes to life in a remarkably realistic way. The world-building is expansive, offering a fresh take on the franchise's post-apocalyptic setting that's both intriguing and immersive. The story introduces new layers to the apes' society and their conflicts, maintaining the series' hallmark of exploring complex themes through its characters.The performances, particularly from the lead actors portraying the apes, are compelling, adding depth and emotion to their roles. The action sequences are well-choreographed and engaging, keeping the tension high throughout.However, the film does stumble slightly in its pacing. Some parts of the story drag, and there are moments where the narrative feels overly familiar, relying on tropes from previous installments. Additionally, while the new characters are interesting, they don't always receive the development needed to make a strong impact.Overall, this is a strong entry in the series that continues to captivate with its imaginative world and impressive visuals, even if it occasionally falls into predictable patterns.

        "body":"This movie is just about a worthy successor to the original set of movies from the 20th century.Like them, it uses state of the art special effects to wittily investigate contemporary questions of ethics, humanity, status and prejudice while distracting the popcorn crowd with an engrossing adventure of exploration, captivity and escape in a make-believe world that, in what is a strong science fiction tradition, is recognisably a few \"what if?\"'s away from our own.Unlike the original five movies, where each sequel was originally unplanned, this is clearly a new \"chapter one\", taking the time to introduce some elements that will feature in the upcoming sequels.Over and over it evokes the sense of wonder of the original handful, with plenty of specific visual, musical and thematic evocations. There are reognisable influences from the 1970s TV show and even some of the Apes comic book stories of that era. But, it is also unmistakably a post-Lord of the Rings epic, the influence showing up in how various action and travel sequences have been shot.While there is not nearly so much sly humour as the originals, the socio-historic themes are more nuanced, closer to the surface and harder to miss. Questions of defining civilisation in terms of laws are answered in a way that will ultimately resonate with modern audiences; a layered and varied spectrum of responses to enslavement is shown; and as expected, anti-monarchist revolutions will always play well in the USA.Non-Americans may roll their eyes a little at the very earnest equating of eagles with capital-L Liberty (one can't imagine Charlton Heston's sardonic and cynical George Taylor from the 1968 movie being very impressed), but on the plus side, Peter Macon's wonderful Raka just about matches the delightful charm of Kim Hunter's Zira and Roddy McDowell's Cornelius from the originals. Owen Teague also does a good job as Noa.The various fight scenes are competent without being overly thrilling (the most exciting action is a cornfield chase vaguely inspired by the original 1968 film), but the deeper probing into the various sub-texts and a fine selection of minor characters keeps the interest levels up. One could pick nits about some of the physics shown in the last twenty minutes, but it's hardly the first Hollywood film to sacrifice strict logic for spectacle and it surely won't be the last.Overall, this does a good job of working on several levels and should appeal to a good range of audiences.",

I really liked how the franchise once again showcases the humanity of the apes, like the touching funeral scene. It had breathtaking scenery throughout, especially the transformation of metropolitan cities into forests. I found it interesting how they introduced pets, a bird is an ape's best friend, essentially. I liked that we exploring their customs in the first act of the movie.While the film's length and the extensive world-building sometimes made it feel a bit slow, every scene served a purpose in the end, especially considering this's setting the stage for a new era in the Planet of the Apes movies. We get to see how the environment, the apes and the humans have evolved. I liked how the movie paid homage to Caesar without directly continuing his story; his legacy felt respectfully acknowledged. He had a good run and his story was complete.The premise of the movie, particularly the portrayal of the antagonists, reminded me of religious wars, where the apes resemble Christian crusaders using a historic figure's image to justify war and violence, a theme with deep implications. The movie addresses that but not in a way that will make you leave the theatre pondering. How teachings can be misconstrued.This installment's message felt more overt compared to the trilogy, almost as if the apes were portrayed as essentially human. The trilogy was always telling a human story through apes, it was always obvious but now the fourth installment is quite on the nose.Good time is spent with the characters, so when moments of sadness or goodbyes arise, we feel it too. It's slow paced but I was heavily invested. The scene where she calls out to Noah was amazing. Hearing an 'echo' speaking, was almost as shocking when Caesar screamed \"go!\" for the first time. Also was she essentially looking for an English textbook? Lol.While Noah is the lead character, there were instances where Mae took the forefront, causing some confusion about the movie's primary focus. She didn't feel explored or interesting enough but I loved Freya Allan's performance.It's a drama. It's not what I was expecting, I thought it'd me more action packed, but it's still good. It was different to my expectations the way \"War for the Planet of the apes\" also wasn't a full blown war as well. I also think this is the first movie since the trilogy started where earth was now actually a planet of apes. Humans clearly have been dominated.Following up on Caesar was always gonna be difficult, I think he was a beloved character and we got to see his whole journey. The new lead character Noah is alright, however, I didn't find myself super captivated by him. We got to see Caesar's full character arc, birth to death; while Noah is already a little older, coming-of-age age. His story is still interesting though.The conflict of ideas between Noah and Mae could have been more intense. There were times when I thought \"ouu this is about to be a big fight\/argument\" and it's just meh. It wasn't as thought provoking as I would've liked. I liked Proximus Caesar though, I thought he made quite the enticing antagonist. Second most interesting character after Raka*.The ending hints at the possibility of another trilogy, laying a solid foundation for future installments. Overall, I liked it more than \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" but not as much as the sequels. \"Dawn of the planet of the apes\" is still my favorite. It's not as epic as I thought it'd be; I think it's more enjoyable if you're already into the franchise. It doesn't do anything terribly, I just didn't walk out of the theatre thinking \"wow!\" People were applauding a lot throughout the movie actually. There was a guy who sat close to me and blacked out before the movie started, snoring the entire time. Thought about not waking him up after the movie finished because everyone literally just walked by him. This dude bought imax tickets, large bucket of popcorn, large soda and some more snacks, all that just to sleep before the movie started. Anyway, I still enjoyed the whole thing, and very much looking forward to whatever's next.Also just found out it's directed by they who did maze runner movies and they actually both have such similar aura to them.",

But they were either afraid or got controlled out of it.I do recognise amazing work on the visuals, which is why I compare this one to avatar. Good visuals but empty story. And it might actually be avatar 2 . A shell movie using the previous one to sell and trying to be a filler for the next one...",

        "body":"Greetings from OppositeofColumbus. Like many, I thought the trilogy wrapped up years ago. So when I heard of the next movie, my first reaction was - why? While I liked the trilogy, I didn't think they had been quite the blockbusters to spawn another trilogy, and they had a sombre tone. Nevertheless intrigued, I went for the early screening not having even watched a trailer or read anything about it.First off, watch it on whichever premium format you can. The CGI is really well done from apes emoting to the dramatic terrains.I liked that the hero was a little diffident at first but grew with the story. Sure we've seen it a thousand times, but it was still an identifiable journey.The ideology splits were shown well, the action sequences were effective and the shades of characters kept me interested. Sure it left a few questions hanging, but I guess those are for the sequel(s).Pacing did feel slow at times but I like that personally better than nonstop effects and explosions. Mae was the more intriguing character, with Noa's arc (see what I did there) being a more predictable one. If you let yourself go on the journey, I think you'll enjoy it. No huge surprises in the story though - you'll know if you're gonna like it or not pretty much in the first act. Have fun!",

The main character was not impressive. The film does not offer anything particularly new, and I miss the unique atmosphere that director Matt Reeves created. The main antagonist could have been truly captivating and powerful, but he simply doesn't have enough screen time to showcase his potential and become something truly great. The plot felt predictable, and the dialogue lacked the depth and emotion that could have made the story more engaging.

        "body":"If someone would have said that 2 of the more emotionally rich movie going experiences of the past 6 months (or so) would have been a Godzilla movie and a Planet of the Apes film, I never would have believed you.But such is the case with last fall's GODZILLA MINUS ONE and the new KINGDOM OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. 2 CGI-rich action\/fantasy epics that focus more on the emotional heft of the characters rather than inundate the audience with over-the-top, flashy CGI.Are you paying attention KONG x GODZILLA: THE NEW EMPIRE?Set \"many generations\" after the events of the previous 3 Planet of the Apes films, KINGDOM OF THE PLANET OF THE APES takes place in a world where the Apes (not man) rule the planet. It is set in what would be their \"Bronze Age\" where all the simian populations are living in clans and the concepts, teachings and philosophies of the original intelligent Ape, Caesar, is more myth than reality.Enter our hero, NOA (wonderfully played in motion capture by Owen Teague - the bully Patrick Hockstetter in the IT films) who is leaving a peaceful life with his family and his clan. Their clan of chimpanzees is overpowered - and thrown into slavery - by a clan of Gorillas led by Proxima Caeser (Kevin Durand - Little John in the Russel Crowe ROBIN HOOD film of 2010) - also ably rendered in motion capture. This sets Noa on a journey to rescue his clan aided by an Orangutan, Rata (Peter Macon - Bortus in the t.v. Series THE ORVILLE) and...gasp...a HUMAN (Freya Allan - THE WITCHER).It is this journey by this disparate trio that brings the emotional power to this film as the trio must decide to try to trust each other while also coming to grips with what their world has become.It's an interesting allegory that is subtle and does not try to preach or hit the audience over the head and the 3 actors (despite 2 of them being rendered in motion capture) form a compelling trio to watch.And...that is because this film is wrapped in an action\/adventure CGI story that is a marvel to view. The motion-capture of the actors is superb - this technology has come a long way since Tom Hanks in THE POLAR EXPRESS and one forgets that one is looking at a rendering and not a real, flesh and blood actor - even if that actor is an ape.Director Wes Ball (the MAZE RUNNER films) does a very strong job of keeping the plot moving and the characters grounded while also dazzling with marvelous special effects and battle scenes that are well choreographed (you know where all the major players are and what their motivations are during the action). This helps to bring a very enjoyable summer blockbuster film to the cineplex - and you don't even need to have viewed any of the previous Planet of the Apes films to understand what's going on.A very pleasant surprise and I look forward to the next (11th) feature in this series.Letter Grade A-8 (out of 10) StarsAnd...you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",

Aren't they the plots of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes & War of the Planet of the Apes put together? And somehow most of the film consists of the most uninteresting world exploration and character development. It was almost like they intentionally set the excitement bar low so the next film(s) can easily appear more exciting. If you're expecting an action packed adventure, maybe save your money instead. I wasn't necessarily expecting an action packed adventure, but I expected a bit more than one 5 min action scene. I would also expect to care about the story.War for the Planet of the Apes is on my 10\/10 list, and for it to be followed up by THIS is insulting. When I saw Wes Ball was directing and Andy Serkis wasn't returning I knew it would be a disaster, when I saw the reviews I thought it might actually be good. (I know Serkis's Caesar isn't in the film but he plays an ape for Christ sake).This was clearly just a cash grab for 20th Century Fox which is receiving relatively positive feedback.

        "body":"300 years after the reign of Caesar, Noa, a young chimpanzee, embarks on a journey alongside Mae, a human woman, to find his kidnapped clan.Directed by Wes Ball, Kingdom of the Apes is a visually stunning addition to the Planet of the Apes franchise, though it falls short of reaching the heights of its some of its predecessors including the original.Accompanied by John Paesano's score the film's visual effects are nothing short of breathtaking, with computer-generated primates that are hyper-real and incredibly detailed, rivaling the best in modern cinema. Ball's direction ensures that the action sequences are top-notch, delivering some truly standout moments. The voice (and motion capture) acting is fantastic notably from Owen Teague (Noa), Kevin Durand (Proximus Caesar) and Peter Macon, (Raka, orangutan).While the apes are brought to life with impressive realism and depth, the human characters feel somewhat two-dimensional, lacking the complexity or depth needed. There's no time-traveling connection to the shuttle launch teased in 'Rise'. The lack of character development, combined with the absence of the classic \"fish out of water\" dynamic explored in Planet of the Apes (1968) and Tim Burton's remake, makes the film feel a little flat.Freya Allan's Mae, while central to the plot, unfortunately comes across as more of a plot device than a fully realised character. William H. Macy's Trevathan adds weight but feels like a thrown-in addition.Writer Josh Friedman's narrative structure also seems to strain under the weight of setting up future sequels, particularly in the third act. This focus on franchise-building over storytelling diminishes the impact of what could have been a more powerful conclusion. It may not be perfect, but it's a good time for those willing to appreciate its thoughtful, if somewhat flawed, storytelling. The film's slow pace might not appeal to everyone, but Ball's visuals still manage to provide an engaging experience throughout.Overall, with its rich visuals and compelling ape characters Kingdom of the Apes is a well-crafted traditional epic that handily justifies the continuation of the series.",

This is the first modern Ape movie shot without Andy Serkis, but it does star Kevin Durand (\"The Strain\"), William H. Macy (\"Shameless\") and Owen Teague (\"Bloodline\").Watch out for: One of the most iconic death by birds scenes since Alfred Hitchcock.Now I can't wait for the reboot of the '68 version where apes are reading, bearing guns, governed and all the crazy stuff that made this concept so fascinating to me as a youth.\"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\" has blown my mind.Its message is about how society functions better with decency, morality and compassion...valuable things that the OG Caesar taught his clan and passed on through many generations...because together we are strong as a society, not divided.\"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\" is like \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" with Apes and you're getting the big picture.What a wonderful day...to see a movie where you'll believe Apes can swear!",

Will the movie still be enjoyable in the more regular formats? Absolutely, the movie is worth it either way!As preparation for this movie. I re-watched the Ceasar trilogy Rise (2011, 2D), Dawn (2014, wonderfully, natively shot with 3D cameras) and War (2017, 3D added, partly in post) in my 3D-capable home theater. It is a very moving trilogy that I had not viewed in a while, a worthwhile re-watch. Is it necessary to understand this 2024 edition Kingdom? No, not at all. It will add depth to the experience, but the new story can be understood and followed without having seen the first trilogy.There is no 3D release of this new feature, Kingdom, unfortunately. No 3D version anywhere in the world, from what I found. In my country (Netherlands) it is playing in the premium formats Imax, 4DX (which is still 2D in this case), Dolby Cinema and ScreenX. I do my research and usually I tend to go for ScreenX if I have similar options to choose from. Why? ScreenX adds peripheral imagery that is specially shot for a selection of scenes, usually the scenes where the viewer can be immersed in the action or the environments. There are 5 or 6 long sections where the side screens are turned on. It is not an add-on effect created in post, there is actual additional, original footage to the left and right that you don't get to see in any of the other formats. There is also no way to see it at home yet, as far as I know, although it could be released for VR glasses, I imagine, similar to how Disney+ recently released Disney and Pixar 3D movies for the Apple Vision Pro.I am someone who avoids watching previews and trailers. I want to go into a movie with zero information about what I am going to see. I hate those spoiler-ridden trailers that give half the plot points away. So I am not going to say anything about the story.All I want to say is that this post-apocalyptic world is the most appealing that I can remember experiencing. It brings a totally different feeling than e.g. The Mad Max movies, Fallout, The Road or Akira. Even though there is something imminently sad about this possible future, it has an appeal that is comparable more to James Cameron's Avatar movies on Pandora. Where the Ceasar trilogy showed a not so distant future of earth, here we get to look around in an intriguing green world full of surprises.I am not very familiar with director Wes Ball's previous films, but he does a wonderful job following into Matt Reeves's (Dawn and War) footsteps. Yes, this is science fiction. Yes, it is a marvel of technology that we can be immersed into this world, but in the end it is a movie where you are swept away by engaging performances and story lines, not by special effects. Go see it, if you enjoy original, intelligent stories.",

        "body":"The well-laid-out and often quite beautiful Planet of the Apes prequel \"trilogy\" now gets a fourth installment -- Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes. Needless to say, I didn't see the use for it; having now watched it, I feel about the same, even if I appreciate the attempt to mimic the weight and patience of Matt Reeves' films -- as well as their seminal VFX work.That said, there are certain downgrades. Instead of Andy Serkis' iconic mocap performances as Caesar the ape, the new movie treats us to comparatively unmemorable sapient simians. Instead of trusting audiences can pay attention to a film that's largely silent and reliant on sign language (part of why 2017's War for the Planet of the Apes was my favorite of the bunch), the apes in this one talk up a storm. (They don't perform \"Dr. Zaius\", alas.)So basically, at this point in the timeline, we are closer to the future that Charlton Heston saw in the original Planet of the Apes -- which, of course, he at first thought was an alien planet in his own time, learning the truth in what might be the most spoiled and unconcealable twist in cinematic history (yes, possibly including Luke's relationship with Darth Vader and the significance of Kane's last words).As the movie begins, apes have all but seized control of the Earth. Those human colonies we saw in the prior film are wiped out and what few humans remain are feral -- for the most part. One exception is William H. Macy's character, Trevathan, who teaches the vicious ape leader Proximus Caesar of the old world.Another important player is Mae, a human who befriends our hero, a young ape warrior named Noa. Mae, too, can communicate just fine, which startles a friendly, knowledgeable orangutan in one of the funnier scenes. Noa's loved ones have been taken; Mae, or \"Nova\" as she is nicknamed, knows where to go.The movie has appreciably better action sequences than a lot of other blockbusters, managing to make these scenes of CGI animals going at it seem more real, weighty, and tactile than many modern action scenes that feature real humans. (They also mop the floor with recent action sequences that do primarily involve an onslaught of CGI creations -- see last year's astoundingly soulless Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.) And while we're talking of the CGI, the animation of the animals still manages to be quite astonishing to look at, even as we've grown used to seeing computers produce photorealistic apes and monkeys.It does still look a bit \"off\" to see these seemingly real animals speak with human mouth movements. Yet, I feel as if their facial expressions and emotive subtleties are even more impressive than in the prior films. Several years ago, in my review of the Jungle Book remake, I wrote that talking animals are never going to look wholly natural. Now, I'd say we're getting there.In short, it's a fairly enjoyable blockbuster. Even so, I can't imagine we'll remember anything from it quite like we remember those pivotal moments from the older films. Matt Reeves gave us a mute girl bonding with a gorilla over the beauty found in nature, distilled in a single tree blossom. Matt Reeves gave us the paralyzing sequence from the first film in the trilogy where Caesar speaks for the first time. Matt Reeves gave us Kobo. Nothing here is at that level, but I say check it out.",

It doesn't make you regret spending time and money, but it's not as good as the Caesar's films. Maybe it may have felt like this because it was a new beginning of a serie and there were compulsory character introductions, too.I think the main problem as a first film of a new trilogy is that character introduction was not done very well. Soona and Proximus characters did not have enough screen time.Priximus' motivation and obsession are logical enough in my opinion, while Noah's decisions are not. Some of his decisions are at the level of betrayal to his own species. I think, Priximus were right about his decisions and Noah were all wrong.While giving humanity a serious trump card for future films, the history of apes seems to be in danger for now. Therefore, the titles of the next films may be the \"Destruction of the planet of the apes\". An equel conflict between Noah and Mae would be enjoyable to watch.",

        "body":"The apes rise again in \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,\" a brutal and bloody addition to the franchise directed by Wes Ball. With a story that feels both epic and intimate, the film delivers stunning visuals and impressive performances from its motion-capture stars, but it's held back by a formulaic narrative and underdeveloped human characters.The world-building in this installment is exceptional. Set several years after the events of the previous film, 'Kingdom' depicts a post-apocalyptic Earth where intelligent apes and the remaining humans exist in a fragile détente, each clinging to their respective territories.The visual effects are stunning, seamlessly blending the photorealistic apes with their environments. From the lush forests where the apes make their home to the crumbling ruins of human civilization, the world feels fully realized and immersive. The action sequences are expertly crafted, with intense hand-to-hand combat and large-scale battles that showcase the apes' physical prowess and strategic thinking. The violence is brutal and unflinching, earning the film its well-deserved R rating. Blood flies, limbs are brutally torn, and the bodies pile up as the apes engage in vicious battles with both humans and each other.However, while the ape characters and their world are richly developed, the human characters feel like an afterthought. The film introduces a new protagonist, a young woman named Kate, played by Sofia Boutella, who finds herself caught between the warring factions. Unfortunately, her character is underwritten and fails to make a lasting impression. The same can be said for the rest of the human cast, who feel more like plot devices than fully fleshed-out characters. This imbalance between the compelling ape characters and the forgettable humans pulls viewers out of the story and undermines the film's attempts at exploring complex themes of family, loyalty, and the struggle for survival.The narrative also falls into familiar territory, following a predictable arc that echoes the beats of previous films in the franchise. While the world-building and character dynamics within the ape kingdom are intriguing, the overall story fails to break new ground, relying on well-worn tropes of rebellion, betrayal, and the inevitable clash of civilizations.In conclusion, \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\" is a visually stunning and emotionally charged entry in the franchise. The motion-capture performances are exceptional, and the world-building is immersive. However, the film is let down by its underdeveloped human characters and a formulaic narrative that fails to elevate the story beyond what we've seen before. Despite these shortcomings, the film is a gripping and brutal exploration of a world in flux, and it will undoubtedly satisfy fans of the franchise and those seeking an intense and violent sci-fi adventure.",

Clearly money was well spent on effects and details!Story wise, it doesn't take a lot to figure out the plot and direction, especially if you have watched the original and reboot. Might be advisable to check your expectations on that front. That being said, the storyline was fine, albeit familiar. Honestly, how original can it get with a predetermined trajectory. It does lag in parts, which I personally thought could've been shaved off to keep the momentum going.I thought the cast did a good job, namely Owen Teague and Kevin Durand. Freya Allen's role could've been played by any actress, so she really didn't add anything spectacular to the movie. I liked the ape characters, not so much the humans. Which has been a thorn to every Ape movie.Somehow, this instalment didn't hit me like the Andy Serkis trilogy. The remarkability of the first 3 episodes was clearly missing here. Perhaps Serkis cast such a wide shadow that it's a tough act to measure up to....who knows? Durand's Caeser was awesome, but not nearly as captivating as Serkis' namesake.Still, it's a worthwhile watch. I'm certainly looking forward to a future instalment (if there is one), and counting on the storyline to improve as well. 7.5\/10 from me.",

The movie continues rather elegantly, concluding the story of the previous installment. The new movie brings the story toward the world of the story that was in the 1968 movie, and that is good. The world looks wonderful and leaves the viewer to ponder where the adventure is now. CGI was well done, but as the Achilles' heel of modern movies, it was also overused. I would still be happy with a gorilla or monkey mask with traditional practical effects. The story moved forward but got off to a slow start. The movie's themes are the relationship between monkeys and humans and the lust for power. The end of the movie makes you wonder how peacefully we could live and why wars are still fought.

There's also nods to slavery and dictatorship which is interesting. I think this movie deserves much more credit than it's had.

While the music occasionally dips into mediocrity, similar to typical superhero films and Godzilla x Kong, I wish it had a different-sounding soundtrack and something a bit more unique. It detracted from my overall experience.The CGI apes are impressively realistic, although they are clearly identifiable as CGI, which doesn't detract from their impact. Medium close-ups throughout the film add a personal touch to the storytelling, making the apes' expressions particularly engaging. The production design and writing are notably superior, reminding me of the vibes from Kong x Godzilla (2024) but with better execution.The first act moves at a slow pace, laying the foundation of the film. The editing is subtle yet commendable, maintaining the film's rhythm without drawing attention to itself. Some shaky camera movements in the most dramatic scenes effectively heighten the tension, adding to the film's dynamic presentation.Voiceovers in the film are another high point, with each delivering depth, courage, and meaningfulness that enrich the ape characters. The human characters are intriguingly portrayed with a blend of cold-bloodedness and empathy, adding layers to the narrative, but I felt like it was not enough. Although the third act is slightly stronger than the first, the transition between the second and third acts feels a bit sluggish.KOPOTA is a visually captivating and emotionally engaging film that explores complex themes like morality and trust with a reasonable blend of action and depth. With its clever ending and strong character portrayals, it earns a well-deserved rating of a solid 7\/10 and a touching 8\/10.",

The wise orangutan \"Cancer\" calls for mercy and peace, pointing to the only right path for the main character, marking in front of him the landmarks of conscience and the sacred meanings of forgotten human knowledge.For me, he has become the most pleasant character, but alas, the philosophical orientation gives way under the pressure of the commercial paradigm of rationality, and the authors wash away the furry philosopher in a stormy river of mass preferences and heartbreaking conflict.The third act was the most tedious and predictable for me - everything became extremely clear and monotonous: a minimum of reasoning, a maximum of actions, no intrigues, only the goal \"forward to a dramatic happy ending\" - so one could title \"Act 3\". The third act is a guerrilla war of saboteurs in the realm of the fascist dictatorship of the monarchical order, the frenzied miasma of which will be washed away by the all-consuming ocean, and the self-proclaimed tyrant will become a ritual sacrifice of the \"New Kingdom\"",

Directed by Wes Ball (\"The Maze Runner\" trilogy) and starring Owen Teague, Kevin Durand, and Freya Allan, it lays the foundation for an exciting new trilogy by successfully building upon the previous three films.Over 300 years since the events of \"War for the Planet Of the Apes\", the Earth is now completely ruled by various ape tribes borne out of the ideologies taught to them by Caesar (Andy Serkis). On the other hand, the humans have regressed into a primitive state and are now forced to live within the shadows of their ape superiors. Among this new world order, the tyrannical ape Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand) has grown obsessed with finding ancient human technology and perverts Caesar's wise teachings into influencing other apes to help seek them out for his own selfish reasons. One day, a young chimpanzee hunter named Noa (Owen Teague) decides to reluctantly team up with a young human woman named Mae (Freya Allan) to stop Proximus from causing further damage for the future of both apes and humans after Noa's village is destroyed by Proximus's fanatical followers.One of the most underrated film trilogies released this century would have to be the rebooted \"Planet Of the Apes\" series. This trio of films, which exceeded the expectations of many people like myself, featured some impressive visual effects, engaging social commentary on the ethics of certain leadership roles, and an excellent performance from Andy Serkis in the lead role as the protagonist Caesar. Yet to my surprise, not many people seem to be talking about this trilogy as much as they should, at least not on the same level of your typical superhero film series or other similar blockbuster franchises. Although I think things wrapped up nicely enough with the third entry in 2017, \"Kingdom of the Planet Of the Apes\" kickstarts a new trilogy of films by continuing the basic story laid out by its predecessors while also offering some new and intriguing elements that are bound to win over newcomers to the series.Taking place several generations after the conclusion of Caesar's story, the film shows us how his influence has spread throughout the entire world and how he is now universally viewed as a messianic figure among all apes. While the previous films examined leadership statuses like democracies and dictatorships, this film distinguishes itself from that trilogy by exploring the way a posthumous cult of personality can cause others to hold conflicting views on how to follow that particular figure's teachings. As anybody who has seen how major political and religious leaders with ignorant followers have fared throughout history, this can lead to deadly results. It is here we see the way in which Proximus has taken the lessons Caesar left behind and twisted them into his own corrupt method of placing himself on top of the food chain under the guise that he is helping others to survive.Of course, this later leads to the destruction of the village occupied by Noa and his family, whose tribe disagrees with Proximus's extremist views. In the wake of this, Noa sets out on a journey to learn more about Caesar's beliefs and whether or not his dogmatic mantra of \"Apes together strong\" still holds ground many centuries later. On his travels, we see Noa discover various things about the world that once was, with strong evidence that humans were the dominant species on Earth well before the apes took over. He finds himself doubting the world view imposed upon him from birth, yet still acknowledges Caesar's role in reclaiming ape dominance from the oppressive human rule of the past. The interesting part about all of this is that in spite of there being a number of contradictory views that the apes may have towards each other, it is shown that they all nonetheless hold Caesar's core principles in high esteem.In addition to analysing the power of dogma, the film also reminds the audience of how much human civilisation has collapsed since the ape uprising centuries earlier. Director Wes Ball immerses the viewer in this post-apocalyptic world now reclaimed by nature, save for some prominent steel structures that serve as a reminder of a world that once was. We see skyscrapers completely covered in vegetation and their once bright interiors reduced to nothing more than a dark cavern filled with objects that humans used for their material benefit. Yet despite the apes' advanced intelligence, it is made clear that they are unable to figure out how to make this archaic human technology work in their favour.For instance, it is established that even after 300 years, the apes have no written language and are unable to decipher the writings of books found inside the abandoned buildings. Also, some of the apes are able to ascertain that humans once flew due to the abundance of crashed commercial planes that litter the landscape. The apes' curiosity of how humans once lived functions as the key driving force for this story, which is why it makes perfect sense for someone like Proximus to use this to his advantage. Like any fundamentalist leader, Proximus believes he is doing the right thing for his people, but as previously mentioned, this kind of extreme authoritarianism never ends well.In the lead role as Noa, Owen Teague has some big shoes to fill taking over from Andy Serkis, but for the most part he plays the character quite well. I enjoyed the way the film showed the parallels between the way Noa and Caesar were raised in the respective worlds they each grew up in. Anyone who saw the previous films will remember that Caesar had a major uphill battle to survive the cruelty he faced from not only the humans but also some of the apes he presided over. In contrast, Noa is shown to have had a relatively comfortable upbringing in his village, remaining ignorant to the human settlements that came generations before him. Teague does a fine job playing into Noa's curiosity, wishing to figure out what kind of future may be left for him if fanatical leaders like Proximus are left in charge for too long.Freya Allen also played an interesting role in the film as Mae, a human woman who harbours far more intelligence than what the apes may have assumed at first. Without giving away spoilers, it would seem that Mae could be the key to bridging the rift between humans and apes in a future entry, given her significance in assisting Noa on his journey. I cannot discuss her major contributions to the story without revealing important plot points but I was pleased with the way she was fleshed out as a real person and not reduced to being some obligatory sidekick character. Allen and Teague had a solid chemistry with one another, effectively showing us that it is possible for humans and apes to find common ground in this new world despite their differences.As the film's main antagonist, Kevin Durand treats Proximus Caesar more like a deranged cult leader as opposed to a brutish dominant male. He is a master manipulator, preying on the apes' desire to learn about human technology and how they can possibly use it to make their lives better. Naturally, when Proximus's authority is challenged by Noa, he tries to use the original Caesar's teachings to make his followers assist him in dealing with this outsider threat. This leads to some interesting moments between Noa and Proximus regarding their specific interpretations of Caesar's wise words, much like how people from different backgrounds might impose their views on religion or politics towards others who disagree.For the beginning of a new trilogy, \"Kingdom of the Planet of The Apes\" does more than enough to justify its existence beyond being simply another cash-grab sequel to a recognisable IP. It remains respectful to the source material that preceded it while also adding in some fun surprises that might even catch veteran viewers off guard. Though I am now optimistic for the inevitable sequels, a part of me also worries that the series may go down the same wrong path as \"Star Wars\" with a lack of direction for the overall story to take. At this point, given Disney's recent track record of running beloved franchises into the ground, it looks like things could go either way. Until then, we'll just have to expect the worst but hope for the best.I rate it 8.5\/10.",

From what I grasp, this movie served as a base for the upcoming sequels.That being said, it had a decent start; exciting story buildup, but it couldn't capitalize. There just wasn't enough conflict. Neither was there enough story material.It kept me on the hook during the entire duration, but I was hoping for a bit more intensity in the story line. The role of the main villan didn't seem to be all that villan-ish at the end. He kind of seemed to be on the right side.I think the movie tried to cover too much in too less time; making a mess out of things.This is what happens when you over-try.",

The first one was garbage too, but at least it had some kind of story to drive it, this movie is basically as 2 hour music video with sex.... yes, that's all it is. The relationship between the two leads is as mindless and unrealistic as the first, and another man joins the scene, who is just as dull as the first.Nothing happens in this film until roughly half way through, and if you even managed to endure the pain that is the awful dialogue, directing and acting, you then have to suffer a boring thriller-wannabe. It's a shame really, because with a good director and writer, you could have had a compelling story with good characters, but no...we get this. The main actors, (I can't even be bothered to look up their names) have little to no chemistry between them, and half of the time they are just standing there looking pretty.I understand that 20-40 something men aren't this movies target audience, but at least make it bareable for us.If you were to take out all the music and sex, you would have a 40 minute short film. Seriously, it's that bad. So many usless scenes that add nothing. The only good thing about this movie is its cinematography, which is surprislingly very good, which is the only thing stopping this from getting a 1.",

Now it's not the dialogue that was bad, the woeful unrealistic story, or the acting, what's bad is the fact people can make excuses for this throwing lot of clever cinematic views and shall we say steamy moments. A movie isn't about the thrill. It's not about filters and fancy clothes, being spoilt as a woman and loaded as a man. No actually that actually is all this is. Netflix throws this at us because of the demands to please the audience with this sort of thing. Any pathetic, girl power, snap chat fish for likes love myself type of person will adore this. As too will any unhappy coupled or bored individual. Point blank doesn't matter how disgusting the male lead is, how bad the story or dialogue, how bad the female leads acting is, it's all about what is pleasing on the eye. That's why a Netflix original cannot be trusted or half of the reviews left by these so called adults. Many of whom are probably underage by the way or only care about a good time and no doubt have everything easy. This isn't about an escape and it's not about putting yourself in the polish girls shoes, or underpants, it's about what is wrong with the every day person these days and how so long as they're enjoying their life nothing else especially not this stuff matters.

        "body":"I can say that I enjoyed the first movie, 365DNI, more than This Day. I understand that the Blanka. Lipinska had a hand in writing the screen play for the second movie. Maybe that was the problem. I've read two of three novels so far and thought the books were more pornographic. I was hoping that This Day would contain some of the book plot, but it didn't. In fact, This Day added things that weren't in the second novel. I can say that I was really disappointed with how Laura Beal's character was so whiny and needy. In 365DNI she was much stronger and I admired how she took over the situation of her kidnapping (Some critics compared it to Stockholm Syndrome. NOT!). Also, I hated the ending of this movie. I am waiting for the third novel and I am hoping that the writers don't take their \"artistic license\" and screw the third movie like they did the second.",

        "body":"I find it amusing to read the reviews of American puritans expecting this film to be some sort of masterpiece of cinema. If you saw the first film you knew exactly what to expect. It is an erotic film, period! Expecting more and worse yet, reviewing it as such, is ridiculous.As erotic films go, it is slick and visually stunning compared to its American cousins. The story is mostly predictable, yet there are surprises. The production values and the surprises set it apart from the typical erotic film. The intimate performances are pretty hot and the simulated sex scenes are convincing to any viewer.I will say as polished as it is, there are moments where the performances are a bit stiff or forced, but overall, a very well done film that could easily be appealing to couples. Exotic European locales, the dangers of mafia life, etc... set up a decent experience. For those who are looking for Shakespear, see a play, this is not for you.I enjoyed it for what it was and had no preconceived expectations to ruin the experience. I wouldn't say it was plot dense or dialogue rich, but it played to its strengths. That being the on screen chemistry between Anna Maria and Michele. It worked better than others in the same genre, where a poor story was mixed with terrible dialogue and shoe horned in simulated sex scenes between actors with little to no chemistry. If one were to remove the steamy sex scenes and panoramic vistas, it would likely be a 30 - 40 minute short about competing mafia families.I recommend checking it out if you enjoy erotic films. The staging and erotic performances are remarkable.",

No one has an idea of the story soon after they watched it.A plot inspired by Fast 5, where they stole a safe and rode it along the streets of Rio de Janeiro.Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) is the sociopathic son of Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and he wants to make Dom Toretto and his family suffer for what happened to his dad.The main action starts by dropping a big rolling bomb in Rome and aim it for the Vatican.Plagued with behind the scenes issues. Original director Justin Lin departed soon after shooting started. Director Louis Leterrier does a workmanlike job. As he showed in the Netflix series Lupin, Now You See Me as well as The Transporter movies. He can do car stunts as well as sleight of hand. Some of the CGI looked cheap though.As for Momoa, the director obviously told him. Man you will never play the Joker, too Polynesian. So Dante is your Joker and dial it up to 12. He is loud, camp and is having a ball. Especially with those two IT guys with a funny grin on their faces.Some of the regulars are even more tiresome. A few should had showed up but did not like those two Brazilian guys from the earlier movies. John Cena plays lovable Uncle Jacob, he was the main villain in the last one.The movie actually has four Oscar winning actresses. Not one of them told Vin Diesel how to do dramatic.

I mean it's pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low, and they're that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way. It also proves how little faith they have in their own film. The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54% rating is a more accurate. I gave it a generous 6\/10.It's too bad more effort didn't go into the writing and S\/VFX (which needed major toning down and lacked realism), as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise. This was too long, too slow, and too cartoonish. The writing was infantile, like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens, and Momoa's character was too overboard and can't be taken in long doses. They basically tried to copy The Joker's character instead of creating his own persona. His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining. Don't even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X. They should've just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even number.Nevertheless, still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment, especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste.",

Don't they have special forces? So yeah, lower your expectations because I'm glad I did. And it turns out to be more fun that expected. Hear me out, the movie still lacks of logical explanation for its action scenes. Physicists will cry watching this movie. Put your logic aside and watch it for fun, it's great. Jason Momoa's character was surprisingly good! The villain's plan was so much more malicious than previous ones. The soundtracks, like usual, does not disappoint. Cinematography is nice as well! What disappointing for me is Brie Larson's character. A waste potential. I don't know maybe her role will be bigger in the next part.",

        "body":"Ever since the Fast Five (in my opinion the best movie in the series), The Fast Franchise has taken a nosedive. It is now straight up ridiculous what this series has turned into. A street gang, is basically an army of unstoppable and invinsible soldiers. Seriously these people would probably survive a nucular blast - or a more likely scenario, Dom Tortetto would likely absorb the blast and shoot it from his eyeballs. It's gotten that absurd.While this movie is close to being an MCU movie, it is drastically better than the horrific previous movie, which made me rethink what a movie is. Fast X is pretty good for the most part, if you can switch off your brain and not take anything you see seriously at all.The story is as you would expect - bad, but it flows from point A to B which is good enough. The visual effects are great, the soundtrack is pretty good as well. But the clear standout here is Jason Momoa. His acting and character is a blast to watch. Every scene he's in, keeps your attention, because he brings a much needed fun and humorous vibe to this weird movie. Jason was clearly having fun here, because it translates to the screen. His crazy character was more compelling than most, if not all of the previous villains of the series combined. So the reason I am even giving this movie a 6, is solely because of Jason as Dante.Fast X ends of a stupid cliffhanger, but if we get to see more of Dante, I'm up for the next installment. Let's just hope thye don't stick to this trend of making villains heroes by the end, and killing off more people only to bring them back a few years later.",

        "body":"I thought they couldn't possibly write something even worse than F9, but here we are.This movie is just excruciating to watch and the 2 hours felt like a really long 5 hour movie to me. It's just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends, until the movie just ends out of nowhere. Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than this.This movie might be better than F9 for some, which is understandable since it's all because of Jason Momoa. Hell, I don't even remember a thing that happened in the last movie, but I won't forget Momoa's character here any time soon. So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some, if not most people because of Momoa, but I think it's worse and Momoa's character gets tired and annoying really fast.The biggest problem of this movie is that the writers don't have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the \"family\". So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real \"family\". Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in Fast 13.Not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it, like the black market scene with the ever unfunny Pete Davidson.There are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy. This movie is a really good cure for insomnia.Like if you cut 90% of Tej\/Roman\/Ramsey scenes, nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot. But then again, it's the only time you have a breather between the awful action scene.The story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structure.Compare this to the storytelling of Fast Five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon it's story, remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were, and basically ruin it. It's not like the old movies were masterpieces, but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded, and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterization.Those movies were mediocrely written, but at least they were competently mediocre with actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree. They were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a 2-hour movie of them doing all of that.But these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings I've ever seen and they feel like they weren't even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable. This one is particular feels like it's just a collage of some random bs they wrote on the story board.They also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious, now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you can't do anything but roll your eyes and facepalm.The movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on, but the ending itself is so bad that it's insulting honestly.All of that with a lot of other problems that I do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage, along with the fact that you already didn't care an ounce about these characters and stories in F9, make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a 1\/10 from me. Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one, but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced, so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point. But, this movie sets the lowest bar possible, so you must be an actual genius to somehow write something worse than Fast X's script.",

There is a truly insane lineup of stars in this movie, and somehow the movie finds a way to give every one of them a purpose.Jason Momoa as the bad guy is worth mentioning as being terrific. He looked like he had a lot of fun with the role. It seemed like he was given a lot of leeway to do as he pleased and he used it wisely. He actually gave me a lot of 'Joker' vibes.The film is long at 2 hours and 21 minutes, but it's a rare time when I felt the film could absolutely justify it. For one thing the pacing is incredible and time really does fly by. For another thing there is so much going on and so many cast members who need time to do their thing that it was absolutely necessary. Actually the fact they were able to cut the run time down to only this was an accomplishment.The action scenes and the story are as outrageous as we have come to expect from this series. It's at the point now where you simply have to sit back, switch your mind off and enjoy the ride. And to be honest it's pretty easy to do with this film. I had a great time. 8\/10.",

Everything was forced, the acting was stale and wooden, nobody seemed to care that they were looking like what they were out there doing! Stroking Vin's ego and not caring how they came across. They were all just going through the motions of a movie with less plot the Wiley Coyote and the Roadrunner. Momoa did a cheap imitation of Ledgers Joker and every part of this movie was just one lifted from 1 or more of the previous 9 movies! The car in outer Space was 10 times better than this 10 year olds version of the Fast & Furious. Fast is just a blatant rip off of Point Break. Walker was Keanu as Johnny Utah, Vin as Swayze's Bohdi. Instead of surfing it's cars and in some they actually rob a bank or two. This movie should never have been made as it contains nothing of what made this group of films popular as they are. The next one hopefully will be the last forever! Whoever gave this more than a 1 has to be somebody related to someone in the movie or a 5 year old! This was so bad that it wasn't even funny and the torment lasted almost 3 hours of non stop chaos and pointless plots with going back and forth between too many storylines that were not connected or understandable! If you don't want to waste 3 hours of your life, skip this and watch Looney Tunes, they are superior in every way!",

        "body":"You know when a director like Tarantino or Nolan put out a new film and you've had to wait a while so it's a big event..... Anyway this is my review for Fast X . It feels like we've had a new fast and furious movie every two years for forever and at this post nothing is off the table in terms of balls to wall action and stunt work. Fast 9 may have gone up high into space however I think most people are in unanimous agreement that it was a new low for the franchise, despite this the film did well at the box office and well here we are with a 10th instalment and it's more of the same. The story is simple, the villain of the film Dante (Jason Momoa) isn't too happy about something that happened in one of the previous films (no he didn't just waste his time like I did by watching fast 9) and so he's decided to not just kill but make Dom and Co suffer because 'never accept death when suffering is owed'🧀. This leads to the usual over the top action fiasco which we go to see these films for as Dom and Co try to defend themselves. Groups of characters end up getting split up and have their own plot lines however despite there being a lot going on in the film it still feels empty and not several hours after coming out of the cinema I've forgotten most of the sideline plots. Some of the characters also get more screen time than others which could disappoint people who have favourites. That could all be forgiven if the action is good right? As after all that's what people are going to these films to for. The first 90 mins I was throughly enjoying this film, there's a bit of build up then a big action scene (the best in the film) but then it calms down after that and really tries to delve into what little plot there is which really didn't work me. I also felt a lot of the action scenes were spoilt as if you've seen any of the trailers then you can pretty much piece together exactly what happens in the full film. The only thing that was a surprise was the mid credits scene which is worth sticking around for. The first half of this film is enough to make it not the worst in the franchise however it's far from the best and Fast and Furious definitely feels like a franchises who's best days are behind it. As we brace ourselves for two more of these films I suggest we take a deep breath and think happy thoughts of Oppenheimer.... Actually that sounds a bit wrong 😬.",

        "body":"Fast X finally went too far.As far as I remember, people are always complaining about these movies being dumb. However, people often dismiss the charm of the action and the overcomplicated plots of the crazy writers trying to show how smart they are. This time they actually went too far.Once again they retcon an old movie by adding scenes that weren't there. Once again they got caught on a \"revenge plot\" and once again family has to come together to defeat evil. They quite literally just rehashed the plot of the last 2-3 movies, except this time they got lazy!The whole family is back with a brand new cast.Allan Ritchson, I love the guy, but he can't act to save his life. He has the funniest dialogues in the entire movie, though.Brie Larson, the second worsth actor in the entire movie, has absolutely no chemistry with the entire cast. It's actually impressive, she seems uncomfortable in every scene. I don't get it.John Cena again charming his way into making you like his character, but he can't act either. Though he actually takes advantage of his dialogues and his own phisicality to sell the Jacob Toretto.And Jason Momoa... Just played a goofier Joker. Jared Leto would be proud. He's even obsessed with the color purple. Someone must've felt very cheeky when he said something on the lines of \"I don't wanna kill them, I just want to hurt them real bad\". What a failure of a villain. Jumping back and forwards between a serious villain and an clown.This was, overall, a very dull, uninteresting and boring disappointment.

        "body":"The Fast & Furious franchise is one that I have been following since the first film back in 2001. I always give this franchise the benefit of the doubt. I have at least liked all of the movies, even loved a couple of them, that was until F9 in 2021. It has now become a thing to expect that these films will try and outdo the previous installment in terms of insanity, but F9 truly felt like they took everything all the fans had been joking about and just did it all. It went beyond ridiculous to even enjoy. Thankfully, now that Fast X has hit theatres and I had the chance to check it out, it has put the franchise back on track for me, even if it is still almost too ridiculous (stupid might actually be a better word, but in a good way).Directly connected to the events of Fast Five, Fast X picks up ten years later, as the emergence of Dante (Jason Momoa) begins. He is the son of the man they robbed and killed in Fast Five, so obviously he wants revenge. It's actually pretty seamless how they tie it all into that film, reusing old footage and adding new. My only issue with this storyline is that it took ten years for Dante to actually seek the revenge he wanted. Sure, let's just roll with it because if you don't, you'll probably hate the rest of this film too. People have come to expect the ridiculous here, as I said, so as long as that's what you go into this film looking for, you may just be as satisfied as I was.The bombastic action sequences are once again dialled up to a million, but it was nice to see an actual race sequence, even though it felt a little short. The main reason to see this film though, if you're a fan or not, is Jason Momoa. His performance here may just be my favourite of everything I've seen him in. The flamboyance he exudes had me laughing and fearing for the crew all at the same time. I enjoyed the entire cast as always, but Momoa just stood out over everyone else here.I should also mention that you shouldn't be expecting a completed story. Fast X is clearly the start of a bigger storyline to come, as the film ends fairly abruptly with no resolution at all. Almost in an Avengers: Infinity War style, I really want to see what comes next. There are quite a few promises in this film that excite me, so I'll remain optimistic for an awesome conclusion. Let's be real though, Fast X is very, very stupid.This film doesn't hold back in throwing the impossible at you. From Dom flipping over a car with one arm to driving down a dam Hot Wheels-style, it's absolutely bonkers. Again though, it felt like a breath of fresh air compared to the lunacy that happened in F9. Nobody stays dead in this franchise either. There are some big surprises throughout the film, but I'm still not sure how I feel about one of them in particular. It borders on ruining storylines from the past, so there better be a nice explanation in the subsequent movie. Look, I had a great time watching this stupid film with characters I've grown to love, so sue me for reviewing it positively. It has fully embraced everything anyone has ever said about this franchise, so at this point, you should know what you're getting yourself into. If you like these films and are up to date, I say check it out. I had a blast.",

Although I am a physicist I can live with \"curbing\" the laws of nature to some extent, provided that this is justified (e.g., through SciFi, magic, alternate universes etc.). It is also OK in movies like Mission Impossible and similar to drive things to the extreme. However, when both physics AND logic go awry it's simply too much.The main villain in the story, (Dante, played by an amazing Jason Mamoa) is simply a joke. He is super intelligent, super rich, super powerful, and a caricature of a sociopath à la Joker. He is able to organize his crimes (which are purely driven by hatred) in such perfect timing across the globe and with access to every possible computer, that his abilities surpass those of Robert Langdon's foes (DaVince code), of Thanos (Avengers) and all James Bonds enemies at once. It borders ridicule. And, the most importantly, makes the film boring.In the next episode they are going probably to have spaceships racing across the galaxy I guess, and Dante will use nuclear fusion to kill.Acting is generally from decent to very good (well it's not Shakespeare after all, so not utterly important), and the cinematography (referring to the effects) excellent. Unfortunately a nice packaging does not salvage a really bad content.Finally, I really abhor cliffhangers, and I seldom (if ever) have seen such an infuriating one. It's one thing to leave things open in a story, and quite a different one to literally stop the action in the middle of the most intense scene, like someone just pulled the plug of the TV. This practically means the producers where so sure the viewer will not watch the next one, that they had to use every means to animate them to do so. Plain awful and tasteless.In a whole this is by far the worst of an otherwise very good series. If you really want to watch it, at least wait until the next one comes out to save yourself the frustration of the unfinished scene.",

But with the money still rolling in, nobody in Hollywood was going to end this cash cow; thus we have Fast X, the first in a rumoured three part finale (until the inevitable reboot).I've been on board with the franchise since the start, sticking with it as it moved from the street racing world into more James Bond territory, the action getting more and more ridiculous with each chapter. Seeing how each movie would top the one before in terms of craziness is what kept me entertained. But Fast X is just dumb, and it's not even dumb fun.The stunts are more preposterous than ever, but the film is never thrilling, every interminable action scene enhanced by rather ropey CGI (the flames, in particular, look really bad). There are some dreadful attempts at humour (mostly courtesy of Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris), and we get all that inevitable crap about the importance of family (if I see the gang having another barbecue I think I'll hurl).And then there's Jason Momoa as villain Dante...I can see what they were going for -- kooky flamboyant psycho capable of almost anything -- but Momoa is absolutely awful, his performance bordering on camp, not helped by the character's dubious choice of attire. It's hard to find Dante menacing when he's flouncing about in a silky shirt. I'll no doubt watch the next two films for the sake of completion, but with Momoa on board it'll be hard going.Fast X is easily the weakest of the series so far, but I'll give it 3\/10 because I guess things could get even worse.",

I think Charlize Theron being the villain had a lot to do with it. Never really cared for her as the antagonist.Here we get Jason Momoa, whom I'm not a fan of at all to be honest.. but I actually enjoyed how cartoony and over the top he was. I think it's what this franchise has needed for a while. Basically Joker...But yea I also liked the cliffhanger ending. Left me with something to kinda sorta look forward to in the next one.Again. I'm not saying this is a good movie be any means. But it's serviceable if you're into these mindless action movies that you watch while stuffing pizza in your face hole.",

        "body":"Fast X had a job to deliver an action movie that has great action that is riddled with impossible situations. This is a part of the allure of the franchise that has been the driving force that has led to 11 films with more on the way. It is not without its flaws, major ones at that, but they're the type of issues that get somewhat of a pass due to the type of movie they're in. In fact, the flaws help make the movie fun.Dispensing with the bad, don't expect the plot to make a lot of sense. It's basic, but convoluted to the point where you just go along for the ride. There's 3-4 too many characters and at least 10-20 minutes worth of run time that can be cut out. But the time we spend with these characters and the added run time do not equal a movie that drags or ever gets too boring. What works is the comedy, action, and a memorable villain (that perfectly balanced being goofy but also fearful). It's not a comedy, but some of the characters and the situations they're in allow natural comedy to happen. What's not natural is the laws of gravity and technology. The action scenes that happen can only play out in a movie like this, so when a bomb makes its way through Rome barreling it's way through 10,000 obstacles, we appreciate its ridiculousness that not many movies can provide.If this were a script for most action movies, it would result in a much lower rating. Fast X has a script that could purposely be bad to make the ridiculous action pull can be more easily swallowed. Quite simply, the only way you won't like this movie is if you don't like this franchise. It's better than some of the Fast movies, not as good as others, but is for sure a fun time with some standout action scenes.",

Jason Mamoa was very refreshing and devilishly funny. But both soon started to lose their characters in such script so poorly structured.Jason Statham would have done better than the ''star'' who persists in being the center of the attention of the world wich seems to be always against him.The script seems to have jumped from writer to writer with several sequences that seems to only serve to fill time and film, but without contributing much to the continuity and outcome of the story.A disappointment for anyone who would have expected something more exciting.",

Even sets seem to be composed into the background from time to time. It wouldn't surprise if there were three different locations filming at the same time in all of the tax havens for films.The car stunts which are a big draw even are obscured by filming them tighter which almost leaves you feeling what is the point. Also, I feel there were more CG cars than normal for a fast film which was a little disheartening.BBBUUUUUUUTTTTTT, Jason Mamoa saves the film single handedly. You haven't seen a villain quite like this before. Everything about his character Dante is cranked up to 11. He is the drawcard of this film and his backstory is woven clunking into the fabric of Fast 5 but at least drives the story forward consistently.Louis Leterrier is a fine directer given the right material and tone. Unfortunately Fast X isn't one of them. It would have been a very different film with Justin Lim at the helm considering his visual action chops.If you like the fast films it's at least better than number 9.",

        "body":"Fast X is an unabashed next step in this series' mission to depict escalating vehicular mania. It's certainly enjoyable and even thrilling at points, but it does lack some novelty. As Fast X speeds the Fast and Furious franchise into its final lap, it can't help but feel like we're going in circles.Fast X follows Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) as they raise their son away from their enemies and the battles that have taken up much of their time for decades. Dominic's friends and soldiers of the wheel-Roman (Tyrese Gibso), Tej (Ludacris), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) -all go on a mission to Rome, Italy, for an underground government organization. However, the mission isn't real and both the agency and Dom's pals are duped by an old foe that emerges from the shadows to exact revenge on Dom and his family. This villain, Dante (Jason Momoa), threatens to break Dom's family into pieces, so the family must figure out how to save themselves from Dante and new government agents who have Dom in their crosshairs.These Fast and Furious characters used to steal TVs off of moving trucks-now they save the Vatican. These movies succeed most when they know what they are and what you want. It's a rollercoaster, so at a certain point you just throw your hands up and enjoy the ride. Dominic Toretto is basically inhuman by now; nothing can kill him and he can bend the laws of reality and science to his will. Action is the primary draw of these films-story has become secondary as the saga of Dom and his band of street racers turned superheroes cruises into its 11th entry. Fast X, however, goes all in on plot, which feels like a miscalculation. Especially as the second half refuses to reach any kind of conclusion, barreling towards a silly cliffhanger that does little to maintain the stakes the first half establishes. None of the racers we've come to know and love are safe, but the way Fast X wraps up, it's hard not to feel like all of them are.Jason Momoa is unbelievable in this movie as Dante. He's easily the best villain Dom and the crew have ever fought against. This level of gleeful, over-the-top evil is hard to find in any movie, but it's a gift in the heightened world of Fast and Furious. He gets all the movie's best laughs-you almost wish he would crush Dominic's world so we could watch him laugh, twirl, and dance as it all goes up in flames. John Cena's a lot of fun, too. He takes a page from Momoa's playbook, an action hero who loses the self-seriousness and has a good time playing uncle to Dom's young son. Tyrese Gibson is ever a delight as Roman. Gibson always has a lot fun with this role, and he understands exactly what energy he must bring to keep the franchise full of life. Practically every time he comes on screen, the audience erupts into laughter.I give Fast X 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, for some language, frequent intense action and some graphic violence. Fast X zooms into theaters on May 19, 2023. Vroom vroom. By Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST!",

But let's try to stay positive and start with a good point.The opening is probably the best part of the movie so make sure you enjoy it. Additionally, all the scenes with Jacob were surprisingly good and funny where on the other hand the scenes with Roman and Tej aren't that funny anymore. Also you need to stay till the Post credit scene. I would say it's worth the wait.But enough good things. The story is very bad. Normally, the action compensates the bad story but this is not the case here because the action is also one of the worst we have seen in a Fast & Furious movie yet combined with even worse VFX. Furthermore, the cars should be a very important aspect of the movie but no, not in this one. The cars play a pretty small part and are just there so they can call it a Fast & Furious movie. Also the movie is too long. We only see bad action after bad action and then learn about how a new character is related to this whole family, just boring.And the most important question: Are the scenes realistic? Not really but after we have seen a car in Space the scenes are relatively realistic.With this movie Universal just wanted to make money but completely forgets about us fans. After we watched it we are forced to watch the next one and spend even more money which is just too bad. Well, I think that was everything and I hope you enjoyed this review.",

The plot is a poor rehash of the former movies, with nothing new or compelling to it.The performance by the cast is mostly bland, except for Jason Momoa and John Cena. This is the most impassive and drab portrayal of Dominic Toretto by Vin Diesel, and this is especially frustrating, as this is meant to be the beginning of the end of this franchise. The supporting characters are numerous, but due to the short screentime and unceremonious entry they have, they all seem like an endless introduction of cameos. Jason Momoa as the villain of this movie is the best thing. He's charismatic and campy, and his jokeresque performance is refreshing. John Cena also gives a good performance, with a good blend of bravado and hilarity.This franchise is hinged on farfetched action but this instalment is sheer dumb, and the funny ridiculousness that the former instalments have is absent here. The CGI is not good, and the direction and editing can be choppy at times, this is especially poor seeing as this is the sixth most expensive movie ever made, wonder where all the money went, probably to the sprawling uninteresting cast.3.5\/10.",

I had no idea this would be the first of a two-parter. In seems like they're going for a Marvel\/Harry Potter sort of finale. Every entry in this franchise since Fast Five felt like it would be the last one, yet it wasn't. Here we might actually be entering the endgame, which I hope we are. These guys aren't getting any younger, and the franchise has been in danger of becoming stale for the last couple entries.I've been a fan of this series since Fast Five. I like the first and fourth films okay, but it was the first one that really drew me in. Furious Six is actually my personal favorite. Seven and eight are okay, as well as Hobbs and Shaw. F9 I like, though not as much as some of the others, mainly due to the absence of The Rock.At this point, you should know what you're in for with these movies. These movies are not high art. They're pure popcorn entertainment. There's a bit of character development to keep you invested, but mainly these films are about the spectacle. If you're a critic watching the tenth Fast move complaining it's not an Oscar caliber drama you need to get your priorities straight. They're about nice cars, fan service, the themes of family and honor, a catchy soundtrack, great effects and cinematography, nice locations, and of course fun, high-octane, ludicrous action set pieces (pun intended).Fast X hits all of those beats. Although, none of the action ever reaches the same level of craziness as the previous film. That's another reason why I hope this franchise ends after the next film. We are now at the escalation problem. Each entry has continuously escalated the stakes and action. In the last film they went into space. Short of an alien invasion, there really isn't anywhere left for this franchise to go without becoming standard and stale. We've seen that happen with Marvel in these past few years. In my opinion, the last couple Mission Impossible film have felt that way.There are also other staples of this franchise present that have annoyed me for years. The film, like all the rest, is longer than is needed, with too many subplots. The fact that everything is interconnected. Each antagonist is either directly related to Toretto or directly related to a past villain. Each time a past major antagonist becomes either a good guy or an anti-hero. Last but not least, people can't stay dead. Death means about as much in this franchise as it does in Dragon Ball. A character can supposedly die in one movie, but they return for nonsense reasons a couple film later. We see that yet again in this one. Despite the cliffhanger at the end, I have literally no fear for anyone's life in this. No one ever dies.The best thing about this film for me, other than the action, is Jason Momoa as the villain. I will say, he's probably the best villain in the history of this franchise, which is mostly due to Momoa's natural charisma, much like The Rock has. I still miss The Rock, but Momoa's presence evens things out for me.Overall, there is quite a bit to take issue with. But I still found the film fun. The film looks great, with amazing action, like all the past several Fast films. And I'm a bit excited for how this seemingly final story arc ends. If you're a fan of the franchise I think this is a must watch.",

The characters of Dom and Letty are so badly written it hurts.

Are they even capable of creating anything original anymore?The rest of the 'family' continues the trend of becoming more and more unwatchable and unbearable with each new instalment.They probably decided that the cliché of an annoying kid character that tries to behave like an adult for comic relief was a good idea. It wasn't. The kid, by the way, looks like neither of his parents, nor does he look like the baby that Dom brought home years ago. I felt no connection between the boy and the beloved characters of Elena and Dom.But, of course, it gets worse, because we're subjected to the pure torture of having to tolerate the most talentless and uncharismatic actress this franchise has ever seen...

This is about explosions, fast cars and nonsense action scenes and you will be rewarded nicely in such apart. Said that, I lower my rate because of the effects that look kind of rushed (not all of them). Not bad at all, but does not feel precise, does not feel well curated as we are getting accustomed from other action movies during last years.

The plot is simple but has a very good addition in the role of the villain that for sure is a plus. Is the one that steal the show. Other additions like Brie Larson and Alan Ritchson are welcomed too. The usual crew deliver well and there are some funny moments with Rome as expected. Worth of seeing on theater? Yes. Is very entertained if you are clear about what are you paying to watch for. Worth of any kind of prize? Not at all. There is only one post credit scene but worth to see it.

        "body":"Fast and the furious returns with a new cinematic experience for the fans. Honestly speaking this is the best one I have seen since furious 7. It reveals good nostalgia with the new elements added. Some good throwbacks and refrences. Even though everyone is hating on how it's over exceeded and dragged with same plot lines the movie still doesn't bore. The movie's plot is pretty much a normal Hollywood rivalry slick but the action sequences used to portray and show the plot add the excitement. The sequences might be over the top for some but has the ability to create intensity everything looks real the cgi is good. The sequences are made to watch in premium format theatres. I watched in imax but I recommend dbox to feel the cars. Speaking of the performances mostly the actors are good. The villain Jason mamao stole the show on this one. The rest original is also good as the series goes on. The one that's underwhelming is Jason satham. It's not because of his acting is the role they gave him he was pretty much wasted. Rest aside the movie ends at a cliff hanger. There is a cameo and tease of an old character returning. Really waiting for the next one for a sequel. Good hype.",

        "body":"This starts with the memorable vault heist chase through the streets of Rio. Dante (Jason Momoa) is the unseen son of Hernan Reyes. After his father's death, he vows revenge on Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his FAMILY.I see what Jason Momoa is doing. He's trying to create this franchise's version of The Joker and I like it. He has a solid origin story which ties directly back into the franchise's most outrageous chases in a franchise full of outrageous chases. He is the best part of this movie. On the other side, the worst part of this movie is the writing of the Rome part.I'm not sure if I should be demanding good writing from this franchise, but Rome is the inciting incident for this two movie run. It needs to be tightly written. I don't get why Dom and his cohorts are automatically outed as the villains almost immediately. There is a bomb rolling down the road and the cops are all shooting at Dom like that's going to stop it. There are all kinds of questions being ignored by the authorities and the media. The premise is problematic at best even with the eventual reveal about the new character. He doesn't control the Roman cops in that chase. I can see what Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin are trying to do. It's falling a little flat although this one has to do some heavy-lifting storywise. That's not this franchise's strong suit. I'm not even going to touch the resurrection. This franchise doesn't care and the audience should know better than to question it.",

        "body":"I've lost track of how many more films there are going to be in the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise, but I made it to the cinema this weekend to see the tenth film (not counting \"Hobbs and Shaw\") and, whilst it doesn't have an actual ending, it was again a good time.Cipher (Charlize Theron) arrives on Dominic Toretto's (Vin Diesel) door to warn him that Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the son of former adversary Hernan Reyes (Joaquin De Almeida) is out to destroy his family. Upon learning that a mission that Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludicris), Han (Sung Kang) and Ramsey (Natalie Emmanuel) are undertaking in Rome is, in fact, a trap, the rest of the team try to save them but are framed for a terrorist act and driven underground. With the help of Mr Nobody's daughter Tess (Brie Larson) Dominic is given a chance to go on the offensive.By now, we're at the point when you know what you're going to get from these films. Expensive stunts where the laws of physics don't really apply, lots of mumbling about family and a villain who will be their best friend in the next one. That this film actually calls itself out on some aspects of this predictability is probably to the films credit, and there is a twist in this, using this prior knowledge, that I genuinely didn't see coming. The stunts, visual effects, etc all are reasonably good, even if perhaps some of the fire effects are a bit disappointing.The story divides all the 'family' up into their own subplots, some of which are better than others. John Cena inexplicably (but welcomely) decides to forget the personality he had in the last film and instead play his character like Peacemaker and his scenes are great. Contrast that with the Roman, Tej, Han and Ramsey scenes, which involves some of the least natural and least compelling banter ever committed to celluloid, and that's before the highly unwelcome Pete Davidson cameo. The films MVP though is Momoa, who plays his character like he's the Joker. Undercutting the pretend masculinity of the series, with a fun, occasionally psychotic and always camp performance. He has one scene in this film that I think is perhaps the most surprising thing that the series has ever done.Overall, I feel positively about the film, even if the decision to split this specific story over multiple film feels unnecessary and there are bits of the storyline that work better than others.",

Well I think that's how Fast X was written. It's a mish-mash of the previous 9 films rolled into one with cameo appearances from almost anyone who's ever starred in any of them. The problem is the story is nonsensical - we have jumps to shoots all around the world for no reason at all. We have a few maudlin scenes from the past. And of course (this is not a spoiler as it's now everywhere in the press) Fast X is not in fact the last film of the franchise so there is no closure of any sort at the end. The cast felt tired, going through the motions. I think even they think there's maybe been too many movies in this franchise. The only saving grace here was the wonderfully over the top villain played brilliantly by Jason Momoa - every scene he was in stood out.Yes there's the usual over the top stunts (though personally I thought not as good as some of the previous films) racing for no real point, fight scences etc so the fans of the franchise will probably enjoy it. But as a standalone film and even in comparison with the previous 9, it's a bit of a mess.",

You want charcter arc, watch Nefarious. If you want mindless action with just, midless action, watch Fast X. The movie is not horrible. It delivers exactly what it's predecessors did (aside from the first film, which I found unique at the time). This franchise has been built on escapism and spectacle. It's a franchise that only requires you to watch and be visually entertained. A franchise of films that does not expect you to think but to simply be entertained. It's turned out to be a great formula obviously given it's longevity. Thus, Fast X isn't horrible. It's just simple entertainment and it knows this and that's the point. Sometimes it's just nice to watch a film that you can just watch and not think. Stallone did it, Van Damme Did it and so on. Action films are like a nice cheat day while trying to eat healthy. The only fish out of water in this film is Jason Mamoa. In my opinion, he stole this movie. He pulled the Joker card and it paid off for him. Some say he was too much but I say he could have done even more. He did a wonderful job of playing over the top which is why I give this movie a seven instead of a five. Two stars for Mamoa. In closing, this film is not awful. You want awful? Watch Marvel. At least this film is honest in what it is.",

But this is also pretty fun, and for a franchise which has got both stale and over the top this is not too shabby.What really save this movie, and elevate it above most other movies in this franchise, are the two additions to the acting team: Brie Larson and Jason Momoa. Both are excellent and show how great actors they are in comparison to everyone else. Brie especially is so good she almost destroy the movie because once you put a Oscar winner and one of the best actresses alive today next to the rest in this movie the other actors almost look amateurish in comparison. Plus Momoa look like he is having a ton of fun. So together those two bring this movie up one or two notches.Another thing which is good (for me) is that the action is more down to earth and \"realistic\" in comparison. To some I assume that is a negative, but for me watching them fly cars out into space and flying between skyscrapers it is very refreshing to almost see something believable for a change.Otherwise this is pretty typical fast and furious and this movie will never win any awards. This is not great nor amazing. This is fast paced loveable F&F fun and entertainment. If you love the previous movies you will definitely love this one too.I give this a very generous 7\/10 but at least one extra point for Brie Larson whom I would watch change socks next to a wall of drying paint without feeling shame.Probably second or third best of the franchise and very entertaining, but nothing really special.",

A previous film will be retconned in some way to make it even more hilariously convoluted, the family will get even larger and whole thing will act like the biggest and dumbest B-movie telenovela currently going.Judged against the other F&F films though, Fast X improves quite a bit over F9, fixing a fair few problems with a superior antagonist and a tighter run time. Even though it struggles to give all of its characters something to do it remains a great blockbusters that's unashamedly silly, loads of fun and gets the franchise into its endgame in satisfying fashion.Vin Diesel gets to show a lighter side to Dom early on that's really sweet before returning to the usual overly serious presence that still works. John Cena is way better here, finally allowed to play to his comedic strengths and his adventure with Leo. A Perry is the most enjoyable subplot of the movie.The standout performance is easily Jason Momoa. He's by far one of the best villains of the whole franchise and possibly the best. So flamboyant, playful and clearly having an absolute blast. Really leaning into his characters insanity and giving the Fast franchise its equivalent of the Joker.Louis Leterrier's direction is really good, he keeps the multiple subplots moving along nicely and overall brings a mobility to the film that avoids it feeling overly familiar or stale. There's also a nice Transporter 2 reference that proves he was an inspired to choice to make one of these as it fits in perfectly with their over the top nature.The CG looks really cartoonish once again and just like last time it kinda works in its favour and makes every set piece even funnier in its absurdity. The music by Brian Tyler carries over everything that was created in the previous score as well as bringing back the themes that were sorely missed in that one.",

Big big shoes to fill, I completely love Fury Road - a perfect action film in every way, so I was prepared to have this film fall in its shadow. Which it did. Furiosa is fun but its sadly no FR.The good news:\nYou want action? There is action, loads of it. Like any good Mad Max story it holds true to its promise to entertain the masses with spectacle. Glorious. We get the hot rods, big wheels, diggers, bikes of all shapes and sizes, as well as flying contraptions, weaponry galore and no holding back on the violence. Explosions, bodies flying, witness me etc. Plenty. It can be brutal and nasty but true to form and true to Mad Max. What more do you want?Casting is good, perhaps a few too many characters leaving each of them to have not quite enough to do especially with Immortan Joe's followers. Anja Taylor Joy is good as Furiosa and Hemsworth seems to really be enjoying himself. Dementus is a great villain, a sort of love child of Immortan Joe and The Humungus; the presence, the wee speeches, his villainy is fun. And he gets to be very Aussie no need to hide that accent. I also liked a younger and much cleverer Immortan Joe; in this film he's not the core bad guy and without the need to get his 5 wives back as a motivator making him crazy we get to see him as the warlord he is. Smart and patient and in control.And there's world building! Which was very cool. We got to see more of the Wasteland and get hints of how it ticks and what made it so.The bad news:\nVisually Furiosa is a bit of a mixed bag; sometimes we get stuff worthy of its predecessor and other times we get stuff that is... less so. The colour is much more pale than the richness of FR and the cinematography is no where near the standards. Occasionally the CGI lets the film down just a bit. In Fury Road you got the impression that it was almost all practical effects even if it wasn't. In Furiosa there are sequences where I went... 'eww, yikes' as the standards of the film dropped. Only a few moments but be prepared.The music is often absent or very lacking. The sweeping epics of Fury Road are almost gone instead we get much more background stuff or even sadly largely silent action sequences. This leads to a lack of tension, nothing edge of your seat here.The writing and edit isn't great. The characters lack spark and bits feel missing. Miller is trying to tell a story but seems unsure of how to write characters in which one can invest. Furiosa has more ambition in its story telling and I think its execution is lacking. The core story solid but it seems a bit empty on the screen. The film jumps at times skipping over character development worthy of exploration.In the edit i really really missed the fast cuts of Fury where Miller really built his scenes through tight production and cuts and edits where everything builds beautifully and leads to a great conclusions. Miller did this scene after scene in FR whereas in Furiosa its really lacking. Means theres not as much tension, not as many 'that was close' nor 'that was amazing' moments.Overall I did like it. Furiosa is a good Mad Max film but its no Fury Road. I'd be surprised if the film is recognized at Oscar time, where Fury Road won 6 Furiosa might get a nomination or two in the technical but no nominations for Directing or Best Picture.By my deeds I honour him...By my wallet I honour George Miller, Witness Furiosa. Its worth your time and money but not more than that.",

It's a completely different film in its structure which allows it to be a prequel that tells a complete story on its own whilst still enhancing Fury Road with its world building. The fact that George Miller is still telling stories in the wasteland at this scale is a real gift.Alyla Brown gets a lot more screen time than child versions of pre-established characters usually get and with next to no dialogue she is superb at communicating everything without words. Carrying that on for the second half, Anya Taylor-Joy does a phenomenal job and was right to fight to keep the scream in. If you need someone to act exclusively with their eyes, she is as perfect as they come.Chris Hemsworth is clearly relishing the opportunity to play a properly mad villain with Dementus and has so many chill inducing moments. This is easily the best he's been so far, completely unhinged with just enough depth to explain everything he does. He's a complicated figure who always seeks power but is never able to truly hold onto it.George Miller truly is a genius when it comes to exploring this franchise. Getting to see a fully realised Gas Town and Bullet Farm allows this world to cohere like never before and the action crafted here is so epic with gorgeous imagery that refuses to slow down. Just like John Seale achieved last time, Simon Duggans's cinematography can keep the action clean no matter what's thrown at it.It makes sense that the only way Tom Holkenborg could come close to his best work on Fury Road was to return to the wasteland and his score here continues to compliment the kineticism of the action so well. The only downside is the CGI which looks pretty bad at various points and stands out further because of how well Fury Road implemented it.",

        "body":"I feel many go into Furiosa expecting a Mad max movie, and at its core it is so much different. With its predecessor being Fury road, Furiosa had a very high bar to achieve. However, these 2 movies are so different, while they may seem similar they are completely different action movies. Furiosa takes on a much more different aesthetic with the use of slightly more darker and less vibrant colors, a much different protagonist, and a more complex story. The use of cgi is pretty disappointing, if you have a keen eye you can pretty easily the digital doubles and green screen. Anya Taylor-Joy gives an absolutely amazing performance. Dare I say she is better than Charlize Theron in Fury Road? Absolutely! Chris Hemsworth was also great and hilarious. Furiosa, while it may have many flaws, is one of the best action movies to come out in recent times, and I hope it gets the recognition it deserves. Furiosa is in no ways perfect, but do I love it? Yes.",

        "body":"Furiosa would be easier to watch if Fury Road never happened. After the incredible cinematography magic that genius John Seale weaved, Furiosa felt just like some lacklustre adaptation of a far superior source material.Only thing I found charming was the overall 80's feel, resembling the style of a Road Warrior, and some scenes feel like they were recreated straight from the original trilogy. While action sequences are, as expected, top notch, the epic sense of awe and sheer crazy excitement that ludicrous stunts and choreography brought us in Fury Road was lacking. Editing was sometimes atrocious. Even in the best action or \"poignant\" scenes this movie had to offer, I never felt that I'm watching it from the edge of my seat, nor did I get emotionally involved with any of characters.Speaking of which, acting was fairly wooden, lines declamatory delivered, the script overall seemed recycled and overly done, bordering on boring. Storytelling was chaotic, rushed and dragged at the same time. Sometimes the unnecessary narrator helped things to move along, unfortunately in a bad way.But the major flaw was that there was no hero's journey for any of characters. Furiosa is the same person at the beginning as she is at the end of a movie, same as Dementus. Remember Nux and his journey? There is nothing like it in Furiosa. Furthermore, Furiosa endures every hardship with the same fierce look in her eyes - we never see pain, never fear, never doubt. She shrugs any injury off, like a terminator. It was hard to get emotionally involved with her character. Unfortunately, she came across as a classic girl boss, amazing in everything she does from the start to the finish, as a kid, and as an adult. Relationship between Furiosa and Praetorian Jack is so robotic and unemotional it's painful to watch. Dementus's monologue at the end was a snoozefest. All in all, I witnessed it, and found it mediocre.",

She was great! Chris Hemsworth as Dementus was funny, scary and...demented! This role of a villain was great for him and much much better than the last Thor interpretations!Anya Taylor-Joy was, from my perspective, a much better Furiosa than Charlize Theron! She did an amazing job!The CGI was there but it was top notch and the ones who complained about the use of CGI doesn't understand a movie like this needs some CGI!The vehicles, motorbikes were steampunk constructed and cool! Dementus truck was a BEAST!!! The roaring of the engine was beyond cool! It was amaaaaazing! The young Immortan Joe was decent, his boys are there(from Mad Max: Fury Road) .Some little brutality, little humor that worked like a jewel!A little minor Spoiler: i think there was a little, very little scene of Max filmed from behind..there was his car as well. The verdict: A must seen, a must seen in theater for the best feeling! The sound of motorbikes and that beast, the Dementus truck motor engine sound was so cool!!! 9\/10 from me!",

Director George Miller returns with his signature style, delivering a prequel that not only lives up to the high standards set by \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" but also expands the lore in fascinating ways.Anya Taylor-Joy shines in the titular role, bringing both ferocity and depth to Furiosa's character. Her performance is nuanced, capturing the raw survival instinct and emotional complexity of a young woman navigating a brutal, post-apocalyptic world. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances that add layers to the narrative and enrich the overall experience.The film's action sequences are nothing short of spectacular. Miller's direction ensures that every chase, fight, and explosion is not only thrilling but also coherent and impactful. The practical effects and stunts are awe-inspiring, creating a visceral experience that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Visually, \"Furiosa\" is a masterpiece. The cinematography and production design transport viewers to a desolate yet strangely beautiful wasteland, where every frame is meticulously crafted to immerse the audience fully. The score, too, complements the film perfectly, enhancing the tension and emotional beats with its powerful compositions.Beyond the action, \"Furiosa\" offers a compelling story of resilience, rebellion, and redemption. It delves into the origins of one of the franchise's most iconic characters, providing a rich backstory that fans will find deeply satisfying. The film balances its high-octane sequences with moments of genuine character development and emotional resonance.Overall, \"Furiosa\" is a triumphant return to the world of Mad Max. It's a must-watch for fans of the series and a standout action film in its own right, combining breathtaking action, strong performances, and a gripping narrative to create an unforgettable cinematic experience.",

The look is off everything from camerawork to editing to the costumes to vehicles to action scenes. Loads of bad CGI replaces the high octane realistic crazy stunts and motor mayhem from fury road. It all looks shot in a studio with fake everything. Big drop in quality and a sense of realism.It's sad to see that Miller has settled for the studio instead of real vehicles in real environments with neck breaking stunts. Both clothes and vehicles just looks very designed now as well instead of a somewhat believable mishmash of what can be found in the wastelands. It's also a-lot cleaner in every way, vehicles look shiny and newly made. It just feels more censored and less naked and rough.The story surprises nobody and is pretty much exactly what you expect. Void from a lot of the epic action scenes you might have to expect after fury road. You get some decent action but Fury Road is the gold standard here and this is not even close. Look and feels more like a cookie cutter action movie set in the Mad Max universe. Had I have to guess without knowing it I would never have guessed that Miller directed this. The world building is cool though and you get more of the cool world of Mad Max so that is a big plus.Actors do a decent to a good job all around.Immortan Joe is not impressed.MEDIOCRE!!!",

I have seen all the mad Max films and I was there at the very beginning with one and two... number two, at the time was a tour de force of action filmmaking and I remember it with a great fondness and watched it over again, many times. I have seen some quite disparaging reviews and I am a bit stunned and wonder if they saw the same film, but I guess everyone is entitled to their views even if they are wrong. Chris Hemsworth was great value as the nutty warlord.'Dementus' and everybody else in it were great fun as well, notably Taylor Joy and Mr Burke when he came into it as his usual charismatic self. I know it was a flop, but I can only attribute that to the amount of dross that was around at that time, so perhaps it was released too soon?.... all I know was that I loved it from start to finish and I did not want it to end. I have been watching sci-fi, fantasy and action films for over 50 years and I would definitely put this in my top 10, so I think that's the best tribute I can give to it. All hail George Miller for this bonkers universe he has created.... Which actually, with the problems in the world might prove to be a bit prophetic. Let's hope not, though, hey?.Hee hee....................\nAfter enjoying this film, immensely, I happened across some superb reviews of the 'Mad Max' PS4 video game, bought it,(..it's cheap enough now..), and......it's FABULOUS FUN!!!...why..it's just like being...er...Mad Max and ,right now, it's as good as anything I've ever played...Go buy or you might regret it..Hee hee!!.",

I'm a huge fan of the last one, the spectacle and action make it one of the best films of all time imo, and it's clear they tried to recreate that with this movie, but for me it falls flat. Most, if not all, action sequences are all CGI, it's good CGI, but you can absolutely tell it's CG. There are lots of times in the movie where it straight up just looks out of a video game. I get where this comes from, the shots they go for are definitely a bit more ambitious, but it's lacking the chunky and gritty realism of the last film. The action can seem floaty and overly ragdolly at times because of this. Regardless, this isn't my biggest complaint with the movie, my biggest is the story. There are times when things just happen for no good reason at all, in an effort to avoid spoilers, I won't list them, but they are painstakingly obvious. For example, an integral character gets killed and it seems to be of zero consequence to one of the characters, even though the movie spends some time trying this half baked romance. I also just couldn't get into Anya Taylor-Joy as furiousa, maybe it's just a me thing, but she just doesn't really fit the gritty role she's meant to play. Chis Hemsworth is a standout performance though, although I do think, again, the writing for his character is a bit garbage. Regardless, this is a fun movie, lots of cool action shots, and pretty good if you have no preconceptions and expectations stemming from the last movie.",

        "body":"One of my biggest unpopular movie opinions is that I'm just not that crazy about Mad Max: Fury Road. I admire it as an action vehicle but as a movie overall it just really leaves me wanting. I've thought this for years but it only really got confirmed to me once it rewatched it the day before I finally saw this movie. The fact that this movie was supposed to be so different from Fury Road was quite appealing to me going in since I don't totally gel with that movie and overall I'm amazed by how much I enjoyed it given my somewhat mixed feelings on the predecessor.I think where this film succeeds for me compared to Fury Road is that it does takes its time more. There's considerably more world building and moments to breathe between the action scenes. In Fury Road this was very much absent by design but I loved the fact that Miller took a different approach here. I really liked the gradually pace this film took and how it fleshed out this surprisingly interesting world. The one thing I can't deny about Fury Road is how incredible the action scenes are and that's no different here. I think the big difference for me is that there's more build up to them and as such I thought there were more stakes going into them. They're long and jaw dropping in scale and it really does give me an urge to finally watch the original films.The performances and character work are also top notch and I really appreciate the fact that those are things George Miller doesn't skimp on in his action movies. Anya Taylor-Joy is basically perfect as Furiosa and obviously she's going to be compared with Charlize Theron but ultimately I think both of their portrayals compliment each other very well. While her arc does follow a template we've seen before I ultimately thought it worked very well and I was always interested what action she was going to take next. A big credit for that has to go to Chris Hemsworth who is outstanding and this is easily the best performance I've ever seen him give. He's not the deepest villain I've ever seen but's he's very memorable and Hemsworth gives such an entertaining performance that I just always wanted to see more of him on screen. Tom Burke was also great in a role that I thought was surprisingly wholesome but also quite mysterious in all the right ways.The story itself though is definitely where the film falters the most for me though. It's split up into very distinctive chapters and in many ways I liked that about it but it also hurt the pacing somewhat. It felt as if the film had to keep re-starting with every new chapter and for as jaw dropping as the action scenes are their length became a bit tiring since the story is so bare bones. I also think the actual ending could've been stronger given that it very much leads directly into Fury Road and the transformation of the Furiosa here into the one in that film didn't feel entirety earned to me.I had no idea what to expect going into Furiosa but I was so pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It feels like such a natural expansion of the world set up by Fury Road and the character work is surprisingly very strong. It definitely has its weaker aspects but as someone who's not the biggest fan of the predecessor I really appreciated how this movie gave me more than I could've possibly expected.",

Fury Road used vfx and cgi to enhance the experience but this time they made most \"cool\" action sequences in front of a green screen. Only a few of them were real stunt work.

They just wanted to milk a bit more just like any other money hungry media conglomerates. I am looking at you Disney.The story was easy to understand and within minutes I was able to comprehend at first. Then, of course with the pressure of the studio, Miller chose to give us only the glimpses of the awesome fights we saw in the og. Too many time jumps made me utterly confused about the plot at some point.I also have to mention that there were some action scene which would have been much better with some MUSIC. Music was one of the main things that were missing from this film. Sound effects generally were worse.At the end, I was begging Furiosa to finish her long unnecessary speech so I can go home. I didn't do this in the og. In fact, we absolutely didn't need this film. Or any other prequels. Furiosa was a mysterious warrior for us. This one chewed all the awesomeness of hers and spat\nback this half baked put-together. Hell, when they showed scenes from FR in the end credits they made the film look even worse imo since that lead people to do direct comparison on the site and I can swear they didn't leave the theatre happy.I am so sick of these greedy companies.

One after another these generic villains get blown away and you stop caring after the 800th one. It is also really gross which is an unwelcome change from FR. Maggots, amputation, and body horror that feels like a bait and switch from what we were promised. That brings us to the worst component and why the movie fails, comparable to why the fourth Matrix failed. The casting. Anya just cant carry a film like this no matter how much gritty makeup they cover her in. Any time she talks all tough you want to just cringe. They knew this so gave her as few lines as possible and just made her look cool. But you can't hang a film on an actor with such little charisma. And what on earth is Chris Hemsworth doing in this movie? He is badly miscast and half the time you wonder how he's supposed to be the villain when he's so light hearted and likeable. This kills the core of the revenge story. You should be hating him more than she does. The other guy, the guy she teams up with should have been the villain--he looks and acts ice cold--and Hemsworth should have taken his role. The movie tried to cover up the flaws with cool looking shots, and at times I felt this is so trashy that they must be doing it as a gag. But no it is dead serious. This is a major step down from Fury Road, it is not carrying the torch of action filmmaking like that film did, with real stunts and old school effects, in the way it was nominated for ten Academy Awards. It's like Miller has gotten senile, every single decision is more baffling than the last.",

This prequel to the critically acclaimed \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" not only expands the lore of the titular character but also redefines the boundaries of the action genre. Anya Taylor-Joy had 30 lines of dialogue that delivers a tour-de-force performance as Furiosa, embodying the character with a fierce determination and emotional depth that captivates from the first frame. Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of the villainous Dementus is both charismatic and menacing, providing a perfect foil to Furiosa's heroism. George Miller's direction after watching FURY ROAD is nothing short of masterful & beautiful creations of what road action is really like; he crafts a narrative that is both expansive and intimate, with each set piece surpassing the last in scale and spectacle. The cinematography is a character in itself, painting the Wasteland of \"WHAT A LOVELY DAY\" with a palette that is as beautiful as it is desolate.\"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga\" is a testament to the power of myth-making. It's a film that not only honors its predecessors but also stands on its own as a monumental achievement in cinema. With a perfect blend of relentless action, compelling characters, and a story that resonates with the human spirit's indomitable will, this film is the best films of this year of action. It cannot be lower at all. It delivers the goods with a gold plaque.",

I prefer to watch the 2015 version and enjoy it instead of watching this film. The performances are extremely weak and unconvincing, making it impossible for you to sympathize with them. The lack of contrast and ups and downs in the film prevents you from getting engaged and understanding it. Even the director fails to create the suspense he aims to instill in you. In terms of special effects and sound quality, if I were to compare it with the film \"Dune II\" that I watched on the same IMAX screen two months ago, I must say it was really unsuccessful in this area.

They made Mad Max without Mad Max.I could potentionally (and maybe even probably) enjoy the stories if they weren't so disrespectful. Why not just in an interview say they were deepely inspired by Mad Max. It was stories you imagined when watching Mad Max as a kid. Hey you could even say it takes place in the Mad Max universe and it'd make sense because surely he wasn't the only one who had experiences in that world. Just don't try to take advantage of the name just so you can save money on advertising you'd have to spend to gather interest in a new franchise and then NOT give us Max.And no, saying it is a Mad Max Saga isn't the same. Rogue one didn't say it was a Luke Skywalker story, it said it was a Star Wars story. And guess what? It WAS a GREAT Star Wars story!If you still need me to explain the difference to you here it is in short.The name Mad Max focuses on the character Max. The name Star Wars is unspecified and can easily include all things that happened in the galaxy far, far away.Now is this (to some people, a very small point) important enough to go on this sort of rant?

Miller and his team stepped it up even more from Fury Road, still giving the same look and feel of the brutal Wasteland, but with even more grittiness and realism, obviously taking advantage of advances in production since 2015.Overall it is one of those rare prequels that is better than what was already a great sequel.

        "body":"Furiosa as a prequel film missed the mark by several magnitudes. This was George Miller's attempt at telling a more sentimental and heartfelt origin story of his famed female hero, Furiosa; who was played more compellingly in 2015 by Charlize Theron.While I understand the need to recast the part due to Theron's age, Anya Taylor-Joy lacked the grizzly survivalist grit and fierceness that would have justified her character's ominous mutism. Furiosa should fill that silence with her brooding, steely aura - but here it didn't land.A lack of a consistent film score also jarred; as many segments went unillustrated by music with a strange foray into negative audio space that didn't achieve whatever Miller perhaps thought it would in potentially establishing intimate presence and rawness. It's a quiet film not helped by a quieter character in Furiosa. The main audio is probably the symphonic roar of engines.Miller aspires to the Homeric and the biblical in this latest installment, but he cuts corners with an over-reliance on CGI and special effects. What set Fury Road apart from the rest was its markedly sparing usage of CGI; here we sadly see a departure from that standard and a step in the wrong direction.We aren't treated to a thunderous cinematic thrill-ride with ambitious sequences. Instead it's a muddled patchwork detailing Furiosa's removal from the 'place of abundance' and her introduction into the wasteland - at the poignant cost of things very dear to her. Unfortunately Anya was not convincing in the role. Hemsworth as Dementus was good; although not an exceptional villain like Immortan Joe.The world-building does certainly help underpin Fury Road, but it forgets to be exceptional in its own right, rather than solely derivative of its excellent sequel.",

That is undoubtedly the most important thing to remember when watching Furiosa.The way he constructs the world's and characters to fit his imagination is unparalleled. The action set pieces are so incredibly woven in to his story lines that you find it hard to understand how he starts creating a film like this.I was lucky enough to attend the UK premiere of the film and hearing members of the cast and crew talk so passionately about the process helped me to understand the enormity of creating a project like Furiosa.Chris Hemsworth steals the show as Dementia, the villainous gang leader, obviously having huge fun in a turn that contrasts so much from his usual turns as the hero of the piece. There are excellent turns from Anya Taylor-Joy, Tom Burke and Alyla Browne as Young Furiosa, helping to create an emotional understanding of how the character becomes so hell-bent on revenge.At times, there is a complexity that seems unnecessary and becomes slightly frustrating at times when character development is taking precedence over action. In some ways the film is a victim of its own brilliance. Because the action sequences are so thrilling it does feel as though there just aren't enough of them. If you are going in to Furiosa expecting to see Fury Road, mark two then you may be a little disappointed.However, if you are all in on this futuristic dystopia that Miller has created them you will be in for a treat.",

        "body":"After George Miller's 2015 masterpiece \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" revitalized not only its franchise but the action genre as a whole, expectations were sky-high for the next entry in the series. I remember being blown away by seeing \"Fury Road\" on the big screen back in 2015, and I was hoping that this gritty and often brutal prequel about Furiosa's childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood would help complement that film and stand alone as a compelling and action-packed entry in the series. Prequels aren't particularly easy to get right, particularly when it comes to establishing a sense of purpose and creating clear stakes and dramatic tension to keep the audience engaged even when they think they know the ultimate outcome of the story. But as we clearly know by now, Miller doesn't do things the easy way, so I didn't expect that to be much of a problem. Ultimately, I thought \"Furiosa\" was fine, but it sometimes feels flawed and dull in a way that \"Fury Road\" obviously isn't.Running a lengthy but never lethargic 2.5 hours (which is a lot longer than previous movies in the series,) the film's primary plot centers on Furiosa seeking revenge against the evil Dementus (Chris Hemsworth.) Anya Taylor-Joy does well as Furiosa, always establishing a commanding sense of rage and trauma, but Chris Hemsworth sometimes over-acts as a sometimes-vicious, sometimes-campy, sometimes-Shakespearean sort of villain who ends up being a bit all over the place thematically. While the film does a good job establishing world-building, the plot still isn't especially unique, efficient, or consistently engaging despite being a bit dragged out. Audiences don't end up learning as much about Furiosa as a character as we would expect for a prequel that is this long. There are two prolonged action scenes that are very technically impressive, but the action is definitely not as good (and nowhere near as frequent) or ingrained in the story as in \"Fury Road.\" Yet on the positive side, Taylor Joy's performance is generally strong, and the movie is still gorgeously shot, edited, and scored while always staying very visually engaging. While topping \"Fury Road\" probably would have been impossible, it's just at least a little disappointing that this film couldn't have been at least a little better or a little more purposeful. 6\/10Note: My ranking of the franchise, from best to worst, is as follows: Fury Road, The Road Warrior, Mad Max (the first movie,) Furiosa, Beyond Thunderdome.",

Makes sense since this film spans decades meanwhile Fury Road is a couple days. Despite that, going in I thought it was going to be another rollercoaster ride but immediately I had to change and adjust to Furiosa's style of storytelling.Chris Hemsworth steals the show like Charlize Theron did in Fury Road.I have issues with the story structure and focus. Miller wanted to expand the world and tell Furiosa's origin but seemed to unable to balance the two together. There are title cards seperating each segment of the film into parts. I would have prefered the film without these, they feel so uninspired with the simple white basic font too.The pacing takes a hit since the structure has some issues but in the end it does all come together nicely. Did this blow me away like Fury Road did? No which does leave a bit of a sour taste in my mouth while leaving the cinema but the action is still a spectacle. There were concern with CGI usage and in the final film, it is prevalent but there are sequences that I wouldn't know how else people would create it with the framing. I don't mind it and it didn't break immersion.Character developments was done off screen at time which confused me since this is an origin story so the whole point is to get the audience to connect with the character more. I don't think the runtime is used at it's full potential. There are several moments that last too long and others that are completely glazed over which would have been so interesting to see, even perhaps a film dedicated to that part.The expansion of the world is some of the best parts. The dynamic of the 3 central points and how the wasteland functions was cool to see. Furiosa doesn't have nowhere near as much replay value as Fury Road but it is worth watching at least once even if you're not a die hard fan to appreciate the world building and action setpieces George Miller crafts. The man still hasn't lost his touch which is mindblowing.",

It didn't add much to the experience or push your excitement, which was a bummer.The climax was a bit of a letdown too. People who expect some sort of epic finale will be disappointed. It just felt underwhelming compared to the insane stakes and conclusion of Fury Road. Throughout the movie I just kind of felt it lacked that certain punch...don't get me wrong, the action is as intense as ever, but it just always feels that something is lacking and I didn't care about anyone but Furiosa (Fury Road had Max, Furiosa, Nux, the women...)The cast did a good job, though. Anya Taylor-Joy was fantastic as Furiosa, while I was skeptical before going into the movie. Chris Hemsworth was fine, but honestly, I didn't find him as amazing as some people are saying. He definitely didn't \"steal the show\". Furiosa's love interest was pretty bland and didn't add much to the story.Despite all this, I still think Furiosa is a good movie. The action scenes are awesome, and Anya Taylor-Joy really shines. I'd recommend seeing it, but sadly I have a feeling it might not do great at the box office. It just doesn't have that same magic that made Fury Road such a hit, and I can see people not connecting with it as much. That would be a shame because it's definitely worth a watch.The movie turned out way different from what i expected and it ended up being better, it had me hooked in and i had mixed feelings at the start but it simply kept getting better and better and it might actually be my favorite movie yet, no words good enough to describe itP.

An 8 is an almost perfect score, and for me, only the best of the best movies deserve an 8.It's strange that all new movies receive tens of thousands of ratings and reviews in such a short time even if they flop at the box office and clearly nobody went to see them.",

However if I had to complain about one thing it would be the casting of Chris Hemsworth as the major protagonist Doctor Dementus.The ugly truth is Chris is not an actor- he's a movie star. His performance was not up to the standards of previous main male characters in other Mad Max movies. This one didn't have the character of Mad Max to lean on so it was even more important that the Doctor Dementus character be a major force.Hemworth is no Tom Hardy- his performance was as wooden as any of his Avenger performances and the movie suffers from this.",

Very rarely will we ever have a chance to marvel at something like this. The wasteland looks incredible. The biker horde and the design of the costumes and vehicles is outstanding. The War Rig chase scene is breathtaking. I loved all the characters, despite the fact that many of them are evil lunatics. The leads all give amazing performances in my opinion, and the music really keeps you watching on the edge of your seat. George Miller has done something really special with Furiosa and Fury Road.

Anya was good, too.On a technical level, I want to watch all the material available on internet regarding the making of this film as soon as possible.

It's painfully obvious they sacrificed the CGI stuff in the beginning for the action scenes later on in the movie. All throughout the movie, there are plenty of scenes that don't make any sense, plenty of plot holes, and quite a few head scratching moments. The acting, for the most part is OK. Fortunately, the movie DOES pick up. The intensity increases, the acting does go from \"Meh\" to \"OK\", the CGI is a little better (though there are still some pretty bad CGI moments later), and the movie actually is quite watchable. It's a really weird film, in that it feels like they changed directors around halfway through the movie, lol. The change is just so abrupt. For a little bit you're yawning, thinking about turning it off, but then you start to get sucked into the movie. One thing that definitely caught my eye is how closely they were able to get the younger Furiosa and the older, pre-Charlize Furiosa to look so similar despite two different actresses.All in all, just push through the beginning. It does get better, and like myself, you might find yourself actually liking it. If you're looking for something entertaining, it will eventually pay off.",

With her wit, cunning, and singular goal of returning home, she creates opportunities to escape danger and survive in the Wastelands. With the passage of time and the chaos of Wasteland politics, Furisoa reprioritizes her goal and becomes the legend of Fury Road.This movie is the prequel to Mad Max: Fury Road. While this movie has the same awesome action and post-apocalyptic feel as the first, it has a drawback. The story is excellent and expands on the character of Furisoa, gives some history as to how the world ended up in the state it is in, and expands on the history and dynamics of Wasteland and the colonies that exist in it. Since it is a prequel, the audience knows what is in store for the main character, making some of the story predictable. Another drawback is the length; with Furisoa's story already known, some parts could have been shortened or obliterated, keeping the audience engaged without feeling like the movie was dragging on. Overall, the movie is entertaining, expands on the overall story of the Mad Max saga, and sets up the potential for more.

Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.\"Return of the King\" is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.The cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien's creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.Now that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.A masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own.

I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.My only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.Despite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic.The score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.The acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10\/10 Bethany Cox",

        "body":"Obviously, I'm aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually one giant movie, but since it was released in parts, that's how I'm judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.At this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.This is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.These were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them.Sorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing.My rating: 10\/10",

Especially the ghost army is a huge, huge mistake. Everybody who readed the book knows the ghost army does not take part in the huge fight, but only conquers the pirate's fleet, so Aragorn and his men can sail to the battle. The orcs think they get some backup when they see the black sails, but then are overrun by Aragorn, not the ghosts.Like the thing above there are more things which i do not like. Like the snowboarding Legolas in the battle for Helm's Deep (not this movie, but still). Legolas is indeed quite handy on his feet, but snowboarding on a shield?

Action packed, intriguing, funny and several scenes that will pull a few years from your eyes.The greatest battle scenes of all time, they are as relentless as they are breathtaking, if you like action, this is the film for you.There isn't a single lull, at no point does it ever dip, it doesn't matter which character the focus is on, it captivates, that opening sequence with Gollum was off the scale, as was the final, epic battle.I will only watch the extended version, as I find Christopher Lee's absence in the theatrical cut unforgivable, I know it's about four hours long, but that doesn't matter, you lose all sense of time in the wonder and brilliance.McKellen, Mortensen, Wood, everyone associated, incredible.This film truly is one of the best ever made.10\/10.",

        "body":"Saying that this film starts where `Two Towers' left off is somewhat misleading, for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helm's Deep. `Return of the King' opens with a flashback of Smeagol (Andy Serkis) obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of `Two Towers,' at that's the ring. The first installment, `The Fellowship of the Ring,' provided heaps of exposition on the ring's importance and influence, and in `Return of the King,' we see it pay off, big time.After the armies of Isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance between Theoden (Bernard Hill), the king of Rohan, and the elves, the main threat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of Mordor, controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron has turned his eye towards the realm of Gondor, the last free kingdom of men, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) must warn Denethor (John Noble), Steward of Gondor of the impending attack, while Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), heir to the throne of Gondor, and Theoden gather men to aid against the armies of Mordor. The dark lord Sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of middle earth, and two hobbits, Frodo (Elijah Wood) the ring-bearer and Sam (Sean Astin), must continue their journey, directed by Gollum, to Mount Doom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed. Got all that? If not, you need to bone up on your `Lord of the Rings' before expecting to follow this film.Since all three epics were filmed simultaneously, each individually has the feel of being part of a larger picture - except for this one. `The Return of the King' is just too big, the most epic of a set of epic films. Now that director Peter Jackson has brilliantly constructed the characters and plotlines throughout the first two films, he puts them to use.All of the characters have their best moments within this film. The pair of mischievous hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), are no longer the tree ornaments they were from `Two Towers,' but are split-up, and take their characters in completely new directions. Aragorn, played with an unmatched sense of honor by Viggo Mortenson, is about to meet his destiny as the future king of all men, while Andy Serkis continues his expert portrayal of Gollum (Serkis' provided not only the voice of Gollum, but also assisted during production by acting out the scenes of the computer-generated character with his fellow actors).However, the real acting triumph of the film is Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins. He continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off. Wood's performance is so critical to the film because it determines the ring's power to corrupt, which, needless to say, is absolute.The first two films established Jackson as an incredible visionary, shooting vast landscapes from his native New Zealand. With `Return of the King,' Jackson really gets a chance to show off. With, hands down, the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy, Jackson makes `Return of the King' a gorgeous feast for the eyes, while never resorting to McG level over-the-topness. Jackson stays very grounded in his characters, not letting the effects tell the story, but only assist the wonderful dialogue and characters. Think of `Return' as a mix of `Fellowship' and `Two Towers,' with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude.The bottom line, fans of the films will not be disappointed. Hardcore Tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by Jackson and the other writers, however, it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels, being that film is an entirely different medium. Despite the alterations, Jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text, while adding some of the finest filmmaking ever put to screen. `The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made. Not only the best of the trilogy, but a crowning achievement in epic filmmaking.",

        "body":"I am in awe of the knowledge of some of the reviewers. I've been disappointed with virtually every film version of a beloved book that I have seen. I have not studied \"The Lord of the Rings\" though I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I'm not going down that road because, of course, the Bible is an epic too and has its own story. This is a movie about how friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice will out against evil. The evil is so remarkable and so oppressive.I can't begin to talk in the terms of other reviewers, but I do need to make sure that I weigh in on this film and the other two because this is a product of our society that we can all be proud of.",

It's a trait that in recent years has sadly driven me away from most big budget American films. A decent idea will become mangled by the money making machine that is Hollywood, hoping to pump the most raw cash they can out of it before it drops dead in the street.We all saw the catastophre of a failure that arose from the Matrix Franchise. Such immense hype and professed genius only made the failure all the more poignant for those of us that really wanted and expected more from the franchise.That all being said, I must say that The Lord of the Rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience. Not even just a visual experience. Peter Jackson has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into THE quintessential epic. He supplements the brilliant storytelling of JRR Tolkien with one of the most awe-inspiring collection of films ever created.The 7 hours of film that leads up to the Return of the King is only precursor though, when you sit and watch this film. It's just plain brilliance. Everything about the film is wonderful. The manner in which Jackson has arranged the scenes, detracting slightly from the original flow of the novel really helps to keep the suspense strong in all three story branches. The Tolkien humor is intact perfectly and the gallantry and just plain coolness of these heroes is plain amazing. (Check out Legolas in the BIG battle) It's all just too much for words.If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I personally believe that this is the only way such a film could be made, true to the source material and completely engrossing, but I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after 4 hours (including ads and previews) that I had spent in a cramped seat. As such, this will be all the better (at least for me) when it's release on DVD (can't wait for the extended...get to see the Sauroman scenes that they cut out).As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema. Bravo Mr. Jackson.",

Now that I saw it for the second time, they simply outraged me. Best adapted screenplay, best director and best picture of the year all went this way. This time: not deserved. The Return of the King ends five times. FIVE TIMES!! I don't give a good goddamn if it was that way in the books too. I never read them. And that gives me a good position to rate this as a film and not a screen adaptation.Every single time Elijah Wood laughs in this movie (in the entire trilogy actually), I almost throw up. Couldn't they make it any more cheesier?! Especially stomach turning is the scene at the end of the RotK, where they all laugh and hug by Frodo's bed. OF COURSE in slow motion to add a little more sappiness. Plus the scene where their journey has ended and they all sit in the pub and skål their pints together.. check out the expression on Wood's face. So cheesy I laughed my a** off.The most worrying thing about all of this is that without the cheesiness and the multiple endings, this would've really been a great movie. I don't love them, but I do like these films. And it was such a tasteless display of drama from the academy to pretty much dismiss the two previous movies and award the last and most tasteless one in spades. It made the whole thing feel like the \"Russell Crowe-syndrome\", as I like to call it. They didn't award him the statue for The Insider, but instead for Gladiator the next year, because they probably felt so guilty. Maximus after all was clearly a more easier role than Wigand and didn't deserve the award as much.I can see why so many love this film and embrace it, but people, eleven Oscars? No.** \/ *****",

Click on my screen-name and hit \"Chronological\" to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my review, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting, cinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat.Which of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood  and the same holds true for Tolkien's books. When I am immersed in the story, ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole experience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense, evocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers.Frodo, Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies, nerves, and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle earth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas Tirith, and preparing for even more deadly battles to come.The heroism and romance are incredibly moving - when was the last time you saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie rubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking - even moreso than in the previous two films.The casting and acting are superb.The film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy's well-earned crown.Return of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs in LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy, however, you may be able to predict some of what will occur, but never all of it and you'll never guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and paradoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien's grand plots is present throughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK, however, is the varied ways and means of heroism  both intentional and unintended, and Tolkien's examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is subtle. Amazingly, it all comes through in the films.Even more than the previous two films, Jackson and his writers took liberties with the story-line. Like the others, however, this serves the film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By reordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices which are consistent with Tolkien's world and characterizations, the film-makers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and themes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The lengthy epilogue in Tolkien's book is greatly reduced, reordered, and somewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually appear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien's epilogue are disclosed in the Two Towers, though not directly depicted. But all of the really important components of the epilogue are, at least strongly implied if not well illustrated in ROTK.",

        "body":"Feeling weary and battle-worn, I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.Return of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I've seen the other two and read the book, I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn't done either.The storytelling is much more professional that the first one - which maybe laboured to introduce so much information - or the second one - which has little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the King, there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness of the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman's love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship of Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin & Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits, the strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and very varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.This is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of the original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book again!)The worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long - but not that you'd notice . . .",

Special mention must go to Sean Austin, for his performance as Sam. In this one he gets his big moment in the trilogy, and he nails it perfectly. His scenes with Elijah Wood (Frodo) on Mount Doom, as Frodo weakens are full of emotion and very powerful. As for the rest of the movie? It has one of the greatest scenes EVER in a movie : the riders of Rohan charging into battle outside Minas Tirith. You simply cannot tell where the real riders end, and the CGI begins. The battles again are well done, and not simply a repeat of the siege at Helms Deep in The Two Towers.As I said, the acting is again first rate from the entire cast. And it was nice to see Andy Serkis getting his face on screen as Smeagol, before his transformation into Gollum.By the end of the movie, there were more than a few tears as the boat left the Grey Havens, as the movie ended on a quiet emotional note, after the epic battles before.I could happily have sat through this again and again. Well done to everyone, both in front and behind the cameras for such a brilliant work, but of course special mention has to go to Peter Jackson. He deserves every award he's received for this.One last point. If you only seen the theatrical release, then go get the extended version of this film. It's even better!!",

Meanwhile the rest of the Fellowship prepare for another battle to hold a human city against an onslaught of orcs.If you check my other reviews you will note that I wasn't a massive fan of the first two films - I loved them, but was not blind to their faults. However, let me just lay my cards out here, I was totally blown away by this film.  For the vast majority (and more of that later) the narrative flowed really well where the other two films had struggled to really keep consistent.  Here the various strands work well together and, while characters have only brief times to tell stories, on the whole it manages it well.  I got the feeling that the film really let rip - it knew this was the ending and it did feel that everything came together in a collection of noise and energy which really made it feel like the final part of a trilogy rather than just a stand alone film.The one area where the film really stutters (and actually caused people to leave the cinema in annoying numbers) is ironically the place where Jackson is true to the book, and that's the final 20 minutes.  There is a clear scene where the film ends, however it then runs for another 20 minutes - which is a mix of scenes that all fade out like they were the end.  To Joe Public (ie me!) I would have been happy not to have all the loose ends tied up in the way the book does it - the film should have ended on a high (with the King being crowned etc) but instead it seems to crawl to an end in a way that is not in line with the momentum of the film (if not the whole trilogy!)  This problem is minor on the grand scheme of things, but I would rather have left the cinema on my high than be made to wonder `when's this ending? Is this the end now? Oh, maybe this is it now?' - but I do understand why it was done this way.The cast, as they have been all the way, are excellent.  Wood's Frodo changes well during this film while Astin is touching in his portrayal of unerring friendship.  Bloom and Rhys-Davis had less to do but came into their own during the battle scenes - adding both action and the odd comic touch (`that still counts as one' being accepted by the audience as a chance to break the tension).  Mortensen is the title character and serves it well, with McKellen also continuing his strong role.  I could list through the whole cast but I will stick with noting two things.  Firstly, both Monaghan and Boyd had bigger and more meaningful roles and rose to them well. Secondly I continue with my belief from the second film that Serkis is the stand out actor of the trilogy.  His Gollum is so much more than an effect - he is tragic, fearsome, hateful and funny.  Praise of course goes to the special effects for making this character tell so much with an expression but to pretend that the work of the actor is secondary to the character (as opposed the look) is foolish.  He deserved one for Two Towers so I hope an Oscar goes his way.  It was a shame to not have screen time for Lee but the film works well without him and it was a brave move by the editors.The special effects do not stand out - and that's a compliment.  Even in state of the art movies of late I have been aware that I could be watching a video game.  Here I only occasionally noticed that things were clear computer effects, even though the majority of the film was!  This is how they SHOULD be used - not as a draw in their own right but as part of the film.  Whether it be the massive battle scenes that are spectacular or the animated spider or just the fact that I forget that Gollum is only an effect, I cannot fault it's use of effects or the sheer visual feast that is this film.I have tried not to gush because there will be plenty of others to do that without me joining them, but it is hard to really fault this film.  It is the strongest of the trilogy and brings it all together really well, it is an emotional event more than a film and, if Jackson needs 20 minutes of slow closure to finish it to his satisfaction then I can give him that in return for all the hours of wonderful cinema that he has given me.",

The three films had their principal shooting all done at the same time, which lowers their overall costs and keeps a good sense of continuity for the films.The special effects, first of all, are excellent. While there's a few little things (a reversed shot with smoke flowing back into chimneys and occasional lighting that's a bit off), by and large they're excellent. The most impressive thing about them is the sheer scale. This isn't a small or simple scene; it often includes thousands of digital characters combined with filmed actors and action, sweeping landscapes, and dozens of things happening at once. This is a good reason to see it in theatres; even on DVD, there's little details that you can only catch when it's on a massive screen.The filming is good, although there are a few evidences of digital smoothing and cutting that can nag at the mind and eyes of a picky movie-goer. There are a few interesting shots, but most are fairly plain and straight on, getting the point across without being dazzling. New Zealand's landscapes provide a great backdrop for everything going on, and there really are some beautiful places, especially up in the mountains. I hear land prices are quite good, what with the orcs warring and everything, so you may want to look into real estate purchases now.Sound has been said to make 75% of the emotional impact of any production. This is a loud 75%. All the sound effects are very well pulled off, sound appropriate, and are generally loud. The Nazgul screeching was bordering on painful, but in a good way. Most everything has a distinct sound, and it's rare that anything feels out of place. In some of the battles, the roof of the theatre was shaking. The soundtrack fits the movie well, and Howard Shore has done an excellent job, as with the last two films in the series.Performances all around were good, but Sean Astin as Sam and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn really dominated the film. They performed their roles perfectly, and came away giving a good picture of the characters. Elijah Wood seemed to be stuck with the same terrified expression on his face through most of the movie, almost Max Payne-style, and it grew old quickly. Ian McKellen, the ever-wise white wizard, had a fair bit of dialogue which he delivered well; my only complaint is he had too much in the way of wistful sayings leading to scene changes. Orlando Bloom, favorite of young teenage girls everywhere, had a few more action sequences (which got cheers from the aforementioned girls) which were quite well pulled off, but his acting wasn't much tested by this film. John Rhys-Davies continued with Gimli's joking performance; he's really too amusing to take seriously, but does a good job at it.For the old Tolkien fans, this movie stays quite close to the book, although they did have to omit some portions, most notably the taking and retaking of the Shire and the time spent in the Halls of Healing in Minas Tirith. Hopefully some of this will show up in the Extended Edition on DVD. Shelob's attack was left until this film, and much of the time spent in Mordor was shortened for the sake of pacing, and it was a good decision.My favorite scene would have to be the battle at Minas Tirith. The incredible scope of the battle, with the special effects, sounds, and many close-ups of pieces of the action, make for an exciting scene. The visual effects especially are stunning; the 'oliphaunts' play a big part in the action, and they're entirely created by computer. There's also some wide shots with tens of thousands of digital characters marching on the field of battle, and even the individual actions have the masses warring as a backdrop. It's worth your movie-going dollar simply to watch this on a large screen. It was also intermingled with some smaller events inside Minas Tirith, so it's not pure battle for the whole of the scene, and it keeps it from being dreary or heavy-handed.Overall, this is a movie well worth watching, and even paying to see in a theatre. I'd recommend against bringing small children, as there are some scary images, and they'd also be a distraction during the final movie in what will probably remain the series of the decade. Not a particularly great date movie, either...this is a real, bring-your-friends big movie. Five out of five decapitated orcs (and trust me, there were a lot more than that).",

Peter Jackson took on the most demanding project imaginable and created a series that will be remembered forever. He respected Tolkien's literature and stuck so incredibly close to the source material and translated it so effortlessly in such grand fashion. I highly recommend the extended editions, as they devote more time to building Middle Earth and developing their incredible characters ever further. 20 years later and the series still looks incredible, especially in 4K. What Jackson did here could never be replicated; he created the best trilogy ever made.",

The Frodo and Sam part is so boring and repetitive I just needed to use my Fast Forward button to get through it.  This is what happens in this part: Sam screams at Gollum, Frodo defends Gollum, Gollum speaks to himself, Frodo is in mortal danger and Sam saves him.  They've been doing the very same thing over and over again since the beginning of The Two Towers.Then the other part: also a replay of The Two Towers, I'm afraid.  Orcs attack a human stronghold and the humans barely survive.  The battle is even the same: everything is almost lost and then re-enforcements arrive saving the day. It's also quite obvious that Viggo Mortenssen was a very bad choice for a pivotal part in this movie.  His acting is wooden and his courageous speech before the battle is so powerless, mainly because of his wimpy voice and his foreign accent doesn't help either.The ending starts about half an hour before the credits and just keeps going on and on. Aragon is crowned king and that should have been it.  But no, they need to sugar coat everyone's exit till it almost made me throw up.Ok, the source material does dictate how it ends (although the ending of the book was better), but it could've been made better by just ending after the coronation.So 3 out 3 movies that were only half interesting.  So, maybe time for a new cut with only the interesting parts (about three hours for the whole lot would do).",

        "body":"I still don't like these films, but this was the least intolerable of the three.  I think it had the greatest departures from the books in plot, but was perhaps the closest to the books in meaning.  I'm not even talking about all the characters and events left out; there's lots of stuff here that never happened in the book.The acting is sometimes painful.  Frodo and Sam are particularly given to intervals of mawkishness.  Gimli is shamefully used for comic relief.  The dialogue's just horrible; exposition is awkward (\"A diversion!\") - I suspect the actors are giving the director what he's asked for, it's the director and writers I question.  Anyway, the adults come out okay except Eomer, reduced to mere grimacing in the background.  It's the little people who suffer.Visuals are often not to my taste, but are impressive.  Frodo always glows. Everything hobbity is very golden-lit and twinkly and twee - I think that's the worst setting mistake.  Hobbits should be those we identify with most closely, not those we're distanced from.  Minas Tirith is barely glimpsed before it's overrun by the Goths and Visigoths; Edoras outshines it.I don't like the battle scenes.  Cuts to show the sea of Orcs menacing a small city of troop of Men are unimpressive after so many repetitions, and the fighting scenes are very rapidly cut and look kinda undercranked and unfocussed, especially when using lots of CG troops.  Necessary perhaps, but it still looks bad.What was right?  They made a great scene of the lighting of the signal fires, and the relay from hill to hill, though it went on too long.  The songs were good.  The human kings rallying their troops to hopeless battles were actually magnificent.  Gandalf was less the remote magician and more the humanized power than in the first two movies.  The tone is more epic than in the first two installments - they seemed to use scale of battles and scale of scenery as a substitute for theme and pace.  ROTK didn't make me look at my watch nearly as much as FOTR and TTT.  And there's more Viggo, whom I love, but he may not be quite as good.  *sigh*Anyway, it's still pretty crummy.  Gak!  Also, I think this one would be _very_ hard to understand without having read the books or seen the first two - I wished I'd refreshed my memory of the previous movie before watching this.",

        "body":"It's difficult to process something like The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King: Its very nature defies comparison.There has never been a cinematic endeavour based on a more daunting...or more beloved...literary work. There have never been motion pictures of the magnitude undertaken by co-writer\/director Peter Jackson and his production team. The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy will endure forever as one of the most bold and audacious enterprises in the history of cinema. It is, quite simply, a seminal event. Other projects (for example, a movie filmed in space) are already being considered and may someday be attempted. They may challenge LOTR's logistical complexities (or, at the very least, present a comparable set of obstacles), but it is unlikely the numbers of people involved or the sheer duration of the creative process will ever equal this effort.Jackson & Company have made believers out of millions of readers who doubted the works would ever enjoy respectable translation into a more \"mainstream\" media. They have changed the way production models are approached for large-scale projects. They have forged what may well be the premiere visual effects house in the business (WETA Digital). They have raised the bar for all filmmakers to follow, and reminded millions of jaded moviegoers of one simple truth: Love, attention, and genuine dedication to (and appreciation of) one's material can overcome inconceivable obstacles, and always...always shows on-screen.And now it's over.With the longest running time of any film in the cycle (early indications suggest next year's extended DVD cut will clock in at over 4 hours long), RotK is an all-out assault on the senses. There are times when it is simply impossible to take it all in: Armies of hundreds of thousands clash beneath towering war beasts as deadly, dragon-like bird-things strafe hapless victims on the ground. Mountainsides erupt with pyroclastic fury as lava flows labour to engulf our heroes. This film is off the hook, gloriously so.In tone and \"feel\", RotK rests comfortably between Fellowship of the Ring's penchant for character-centric drama, and The Two Towers' colder, more mechanical \"war movie\" approach. What we end up with, is, in essence, an emotionally charged war movie sprawling in scale yet intimate in heart, its effects are frequently overpowering.",

The biggest bone of contention I have is with the tiresomely oft-repeated nonsense that books cannot be adapted accurately to the screen. To attempt to defend Peter Jackson and these films with this claptrap is particularly misguided. Does not a picture speak a thousand words? Has not Peter Jackson used ten hours of pictures? By that measure, he could have covered Tolkien's trilogy 300 times over! To have been given ten hours and such a huge budget, was an unprecedented opportunity but what did Jackson do with it? He made his own interpretation. He got to make these three films because *Tolkien's* The Lord of the Rings demanded it. It wasn't right to use the opportunity to spend the time and money making his own hacked-up version; to *change* the story, alter characters, omit characters, change the locations of events, *make up* various events. That he did all this was sheer hubris – but since he's made profits, he's gotten away with it and only Tolkien's faithful are saddened and sickened. Bear in mind the money and success that Jackson has reaped by climbing on Tolkien's shoulders, having assured fans that he would remain faithful to the book. To those who really think books (let alone long books) cannot be accurately adapted to the screen, I say take a long hard look at Richard Boleslawski's Les Miserables (1935). Adapted by W.P Lipscomb, Victor Hugo's huge novel (longer than The Lord of the Rings) is faithfully covered in just 108 minutes. Peter Jackson had over five times that, so there is absolutely no excuse for altering the story in any way.I'm absolutely certain that any director in the business could have achieved movies at least as good as Jackson's given the same opportunity; and any director that had the brains to stick to the proper story would have produced *better* ones. The Lord of the Rings is apparently the second most popular book after the Holy Bible, which, I would say, suggests that Tolkien writes a story a tad better than a certain Peter who?",

        "body":"Overall, I am disappointed, though not surprised, by the negative criticism of this movie. Indeed, this criticism exceeds the offering of alternative viewpoints and the expression of other cinematic possibilities and sinks into the realm of bitter invective. So many armchair critics are currently competing with avid Tolkien, Jackson, and movie fans alike in order to espouse the \"true\" value of Peter Jackson's landmark movie trilogy. For it is a landmark event in cinema history based on its sheer size and careful attention, praise and evisceration apart. The issue that greatly irritates me and pushes me to write is that many of the negative reviewers on this website have such limited room in their imagination that they cannot conceive of a world outside their own narrow framework. I find that a most sad reality in light of the legacy of Tolkien, Jackson, and all good story-tellers -- to create, to engender, and to nourish the growth of any and all imaginative ventures.The problem with imagination is that it is an individual event, a unique subjective experience that a single person experiences completely alone. Those who enter into the realm of Art, Fiction, Fantasy, and any degree of Story-telling agree (willingly or no) to take that personal act of creation and primal nature and share it with the community of human beings, each of whom has his or her own imaginative context. It is a bold act of sacrifice, self-confidence, and faith (spiritual, one could argue) to thrust the contents of one's subjective reality into (to borrow from Douglas Adams) the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash. People who do so deserve respect for the mere creative act, the ability to foist forward what they believe is true. From Homer to Bill O'Reilly, this concept of personal creation, what Tolkien called Sub-Creation, is the essence of modern human existence, and we owe it to each other to respect the right to creation history has granted us.Therefore, in defense of both Tolkien (whom some on this website have maligned) and Jackson (whom many have maligned), I forward that both are imaginative creators in their own right, with different and completely acceptable offerings to the world. Those who cannot tolerate either for \"mediocre writing\" or \"atrocious film-making\" should offer forth their literary or cinematic offspring instead of cunningly-worded diatribes of their deep dissatisfaction with all that does not conform to their inner reality. Then, we few who believe in and trust the creative ability of all will be able to see how those critical inner realities (so authoritative in exposition) match up with the rest of our perceptions.Tolkien was an enormously talented, intelligent, and imaginative man, one whose stories, though unpolished by experience, still managed to attract a worldwide audience and devoted following with their luster. Jackson's movies took the sheen and inherent value of Tolkien's stories and placed it in a visual medium, a place where fans of LOTR could witness and love the events and people they held so dear. Of course Tolkien's story is imperfect; of course Jackson's movies aren't as full as we wish them to be. Their great successes are that they still manage to capture our imagination, to move us, to take genuine truth and isolate it in a world outside our ken, a place where we see ourselves better against a foreign backdrop. Both have created and done so masterfully, with the intuitive grasp that is termed \"genius.\" Tolkien would have had much at issue with Jackson's movies, where plot incongruities, lapsed character development, and visual splendor overshadow the philological and melancholic overtones of his book. Jackson admits he finds much at issue with Tolkien's book, including a lack of clear character motivation, extended and largely extraneous dialog, and heightened language not suited for Hollywood. But Tolkien, despite his perfectionist griping and loathing for any film version of his book, would respect Jackson for continuing the act of creation, for taking his modern-day mythology and spreading it to as many people as possible. Jackson has taken the beauty, the scope, the complexity, the richness, and the loss that permeate Middle-Earth and shared those leitmotifs with the world. Tolkien's characteristic \"niggling\" would have prevented any such attempt (even Jackson's), but in the end, his heritage lives on in beautifully conceived and executed films.I do not ask others to stifle their opinions of this movie or any other. Indeed, continue to express the direst and bleakest of your frustrations with the creative power of others, as it may lead you to actually do some creation yourself. Remember though, that the great evils of history, from Satan to Hitler to Sauron, are never capable of creation -- only twisting, mutilating, mocking, deforming, and misapplying. Be open to the vision of others and what they have to offer, especially when that offering comes in the virtuosic shape of Tolkien's writing or Jackon's movies. Look for the True in the Secondary and how it manifests itself everywhere once you recognize it.This movie receives a 10 from me because it not only maintains incredible faithfulness to Tolkien's themes (and yes, events may deviate in completely separate and dissimilar media) but it asks intelligent viewers to look deeper into the circumstances of its own creation and beauty. From the loyalty of Sam and the weight of epic history to the sacrifice of Arwen and the never-completely-won nature of war, Jackson's movies capture the essence and heart of Tolkien's tale, with the benefit of the director's own imaginative fruit as well. The world owes Mr. Jackson its gratitude, as he has created another world and another reality that so many can, do, and will cherish.One final word: There are few who would not rather be wandering in a far green country rather than dwelling in their own Circles of the World.",

        "body":"After the last two Lord of the Rings films, the journey of so many heroes has come so far, and it all leads up to this. Darkness falls upon all of Middle-Earth. Huge armies of orcs march upon the kingdoms of men. The One Ring comes closer to its evil master. Could this be the end of the world, or the start of a new beginning? This final chapter in the film series starts off with an incredibly moving sequence: the heartbreaking tale of Gollum's origins. From the on, it picks right back up where the last films left off, chronicling the journey of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they tread in dark and dangerous territory, combating orcs, one giant spider, and ultimately themselves as they approach the threshold of Mount Doom. At the same time, the film presents some of the biggest and most epic scenes ever committed to film: the Battle of Minas Tirith. It is a huge spectacle that fills up the entire screen with thousands and thousands of orcs, men, war machines, lumbering beasts, Nazgûl, cavalry, massive elephants, and even ghosts. It is a long struggle that fills up most of the movie's runtime, but it's always awe-inspiring. As if that's not enough, the film then brings the battle to the gates of Mordor, for one grand climax. Even in the calm before each battle, the film remains as captivating as its predecessors, thanks to its style and storytelling prowess. If there's anything to truly complain about, it would be the lengthy denouement. Overall, however, the experience of The Return of the King has never failed to invoke feelings of awe.At this point, the characters of the film are well-established and intimately familiar, but the film does take its time to explore more of the familiar faces and elaborate on fresh new characters. They all come together to contribute to the multiple conflicts, tying every strand of the plot to one epic climax; it's a sublime union that makes everything in the three movies relevant, and provides satisfying closure all around. Many liberties are taken from the original novels, but for the big screen, it works to generate the best possible spectacle and make the plot work evenly. Themes of war, corruption, addiction, good and evil, and adventure all prevail.As before, this film is crafted with excellent photography and editing. All the major players return and contribute fantastic performances in their respective roles (especially Viggo Mortensen, who stands out more in this film than before, but it is always a pleasure to watch Ian McKellen as Gandalf, along with the rest of the fellowship and all their allies). Writing is superb. This production boasts some excellent sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are huge; at its time, it was most groundbreaking for generating the biggest armies ever seen on screen all at once. Despite aging a bit, the effects are still impressive. Howard Shore's music score is as masterful as ever.Return of the King delivers the best possible payoff for the Lord of the Rings trilogy (and it might even outshine the Hobbit saga in the end). Not only does it boast some of the biggest battles, but it is also a film with power and beauty. It has cemented itself as one of my all-time favorites (was my number-one favorite for quite a few years), and the Lord of the Rings saga overall remains one of the most sublime marriages between spectacle, storytelling, and style.If you watch the Extended Edition of this film, you will be treated to about an hour of bonus scenes, which offers a lot of excellent substance. Among the additions, there are longer battle scenes, a scene showing the fate of Saruman and Wormtongue, an extended encounter with the Army of the Dead, a parley with the Mouth of Sauron, and more. I think most of these scenes are really awesome, and this version of the film is definitely worth seeing.5\/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)",

This is an excellent end to an incredible trilogy. The plot is engaging from start to finish, and this moves rather smoothly, with great pacing. This is funny several times, and there is very little of the annoying(and still easily ignored) comic relief. I am thrilled to see Gollum turn out to be such a richly detailed and thoroughly developed character. The meld of live-action and CGI elements is perfect. You forget that not everything you're seeing is really there. The effects are impeccable, in general, and the imaginative designs, and boundless creativity are amazing. Creepy and dark, this isn't actually depressing, in spite of many gloomy moments. The battle sequences are intense, well-choreographed and awesome. This has astonishing editing and cinematography, and has a marvelous look. The acting doesn't let you down at any point. There is a lot of scary and disturbing content in this, and it might be too much for children.

        "body":"The Lord of the Rings is without doubt the most epic and staggering film undertaking of all time. How Peter Jackson pulled it off I will never know, maybe he used one of Gandalf's enchantments! Rarely throughout the 12 hour epic is there a bad scene or a dull moment, every scene has had so much thought and hard work poured into it. From the writing, to the production crew, to the acting, to the scenery,to the music (oh god I love the music)and just everybody's determination to pull this near impossible feat off, even fantasy haters would have to admit their amazement. Never has a movie given me so many spine tingly moments and scenes of such beauty that they nearly push me to tears. Peter Jackson seemed so blessed with good fortune, (Viggo Mortensens' last minute replacement says it all), it was as if the spirit of Tolkien himself was guiding it along. As I see this as one whole movie, I won't be reviewing just 'The Return of the King'.I saw the first film 'The Fellowhip of the Ring' when I was 12, and I'm 21 now and I still haven't been more absorbed by a movie in the cinema and I doubt I ever will. The transition from the innocence and lightness of the Shire at the start to the dark epic of the quest later is nothing short of brilliant. I think 'Fellowship' is my favourite of the three, it goes through the most development and felt the most satisfying. The whole mines of Moria sequence is my standout moment of the entire trilogy. To the battle with the cave troll and the escape from the balrog, it is exhilarating, involving and most of all - emotional.'The Two Towers' has the hardest task of being the middle film, but it more than rises to the challenge. It drops you straight into the action and doesn't hold up. The Rohan sequences are the best bits of the film, culminating in the battle of helms deep which to me is the most personal and intense battle of the trilogy. The creation of Gollum was revolutionary, through CGI and motion capture never has a computerised character seemed so real.'The Return of the King' delivers the emotional finale we all hoped it would. I remember sitting in the cinema hearing all sorts of sobbing all around me during the climax on mount doom. There are so many stand-out moments in this movie but the one I will mention is the charge of the Rohirrim. This scene actually pushed me to tears on first viewing, not because it was sad but because it was so... awesome. I was so happy when this film won 11 Oscars, it more than deserved it, I was hoping it would win more than 11 but oh well.Any gripes I have for the trilogy, would be the portrayal of its big bad Sauron, and considering that Sauron is the centre of 'The Lord of the Rings' this is definitely a problem. If there was one thing from the books that is unfilmable it is definitely Sauron. How do you portray a villain that hardly appears and any descriptions of him there are, are so vague and surreal? Is Sauron a big flaming eye or did he have a physical form? This is never made clear in the books and poses a big obstacle for film, where the audience needs to see their villain. Peter Jackson and co do the best they can with the material, and chose to literally portray Sauron as the big flaming eye. However this is not enough to satisfy, especially during the climax of 'Return of the King' where the dark lord is basically a lighthouse! The films make the mistake of bigging Sauron up through the films, and ultimately it fizzles out by the end which is a real shame.As you can tell from what I have said, I love 'The Lord of the Rings', and I would say it is my favourite film of all time. No other film has moved me as much as this and given me so many different emotions from fear, to sadness to laughter. I honestly couldn't imagine anyone else playing the characters, it was if they were made for them. The actors all generally had a special relationship with one another and with Peter Jackson (just watch the extras), and that what you are watching on screen is genuine. It was almost to the point that the actors weren't working so hard out of professionalism but out of love and devotion to Mr.Jackson. Hardly any other films can claim they had this kind of magic behind the camera. Honourable mentions will be given to Ian Mckellen as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Elijah Wood as Frodo, I felt these three literally became the characters they were playing, but of course there are countless others to mention but I don't have time. Howard Shore's score is possibly the best movie score ever, and the films would be nothing without it.Ultimately say what you will hardcore Tolkien fans about the films, you cannot deny that they did so much for Tolkiens' greatest work and made it one of the most recognisable stories in the world. If you have somehow not seen these films, first of all slap yourself and secondly go buy the extended editions as these are the true versions of the films and include many great scenes that were cut - especially 'The Return of the King' which had many vital scenes cut aka. Saruman's last hoorah and Gandalf confronting the Witch King. Peter Jackson I salute you, and New Zealand!",

        "body":"It's hard to imagine that anyone would join 'The Lord of the Rings' saga so late in its on-screen life, so if you've never heard of this tale (there must be at least one of you!) then I suggest you begin with 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and take it from there. However, if, like the rest of us, you've been closely following the story of 'Middle Earth' where two innocent hobbits are carrying an evil ring of power to its destruction, then you'll be desperate to see how it ends. Although, based on what most people seem to think about the trilogy overall, 'The Return of the King' appears to be most people's favourite (worth noting that mine is 'The Two Towers!').Maybe it's because the source material (J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy of novels) has already been written that the concluding chapter is so good. Many stories start out with much promise and tend to die off (see the last series of 'Game of Thrones!'). Luckily, this doesn't happen here. Everything and everyone that made the saga great comes together and gives the audience the perfect ending that they deserve.Yes, purists of the book may argue about the odd creative liberty here and there which has been taken when transferring it to the big screen, but, more often than not, everything lands where it should. Re-watching the trilogy today (nearly twenty years after its release) I noticed that some of the special effects in the first film ('Fellowship') didn't look quite so good as they did at the time (i.e. more green screen-ish), yet this final chapter seems as perfect as it was in its day.There are so many fine performances in 'Return of the King' that it's hard to pick a favourite. In the first two movies I always preferred the human characters, such as Gandalf and Aragorn (and, of course, the computer-generated Gollum in 'The Two Towers'). Yet now, I really felt more of a connection to the two hobbits - Frodo and Sam. Following their journey I really did get a sense of how much they'd suffered here - a rare feat nowadays when so many on-screen heroes seem to be able to absorb inhuman amounts of punishment with barely a ruffled head of hair (and don't get me started on Disney's 'Star Wars' trilogy).As I said before, you really need to watch the first film to know if you'll truly enjoy its conclusion and, if you do, then 'Return of the King' will certainly not disappoint. It has everything from great character-acting, to excellent special effects and a perfect setting and direction. Not since the ORIGINAL 'Star Wars' trilogy has a set of films come together so spectacularly.",

However, none of the other characters in the remaining part of the fellowship suffered no more than 3 seconds of any kind of acting at a time, as nearly all the dialogue from the book is erased.  And at the ending sequence, when Frodo wakes up, the cheerful scenes drag on forever, when Peter Jackson could have saved it by cutting off half the slow motion and instead, showing the last parts of the book with the burning & enslavement of the shire, and the uprising that followed.

I like to think of the entire trilogy as one long movie-filmed simultaneously but obviously having had to be released over three parts to be profitable at the box office. Much like Tolkien's novel itself, having to be split in three volumes.The quality of production and post-production all maintains its standards across the trilogy. I would like to say that although \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" remains my personal favorite of the three, \"The Return of the King\" being the one that finally brought home the clean sweep at the Oscars is very fitting and deserved.The reincorporated scenes from the extended editions of all of these movies really helps a lot in fleshing out the world of Middle Earth. I can't imagine going back now to the theatrical cuts. A few scenes here and there do slow down the pacing just a bit, but in a movie as grand and epic as this, it's all for the better to extend our time in this unforgettable fantasy world that Tolkien so vividly described and that Jackson so faithfully brought to life on the big screen.",

Bernard Hill once again brings authority to the role of King Theoden and his inspiring presence on the battlefield left me in awe. Miranda Otto brings strength to the role of Eowyn and makes the character's best moments unforgettable. Ian McKellen once again brought his commanding presence as Gandalf to bear as he tried desperately to hold everything together.This film follows the familiar format of the first two films in taking Tolkien's work and streamlining it to create a well-paced film.

Director Peter Jackson has achieved the impossible, to make this trilogy and make it so that Tolkien fans will be pleased with it in comparison to the book. The special effects are amazingly good, the actors (Sean Astin who play Samwise Gamgee particularly) are fabulous in their roles and the plot is unflawed, representing the book perfectly. There are parts left out but this was always to be expected. Peter Jackson, on first editing the film had a 6 hour long film that he was happy with. Now, although us Lord of the Rings fans may have been more than happy to sit through that, I don't think others would have been! So inevitably pieces and lines from the book have been taken out. But what we are left with is a film that works perfectly and is a masterpiece. Undoubtedly there will be plenty of extra footage on the extended DVD and so we'll just have to wait for that to see the film in its entirety. It's, arguably and in my own opinion, the best of the three films and one that fans and just movie-goers will love.

By the time he realises his mistake, he's been dragged into the lair of Shelob, a monstrous spider, and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend, Sam heads into an orc citadel...Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin (Billy Boyd) with him to Minas Tirith, after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. \\Not only is the city under siege, but the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane, even sending his one remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. With Minas Tirith crumbling, Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) only hope may to be summon an army of the dead, who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the dead won't help him if Frodo doesn't destroy the Ring...The \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history, and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to, has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait, I guess.Peter Jackson really outdoes himself. You know those battle scenes in \"Two Towers\" and \"Fellowship of the Ring,\" with the swooping camera and thousands of orcs, clashing with men on a gloomy battlefield? In \"Return of the King,\" Jackson surpasses that. There's everything from volcanic eruptions to an invasion of howling ghosts to the attack of the oliphaunts (like elephants, only bigger). Each action scene a shattering ride, and there's no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them don't.But if Jackson manages the epic battles well, he does an even better job with the gentler, quieter moments. The action slows down, and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other. They cry, they hug, they think about home -- such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkien's world, resculpting Tolkien's words into equally rich movie dialogue.Elijah Wood gives an unparallelled performance as Frodo Baggins. Frodo's gradual deterioration is wrenching to watch, and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam, who is increasingly the \"strong\" hobbit, rather than the follower. The final scenes between these two outstanding actors are beautiful and understated.But all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains, and the \"I'm going to take care of you\" scene is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Mortensen gets more kingly every moment, while Ian McKellen balances action with grandfatherly wisdom. Bernard Hill has a quietly moving final scene, while Miranda Otto makes the despairing Eowyn a strong, kick-butt heroine.Perhaps the most striking thing about \"Return of the King\" is the final fourth of the film. While the \"multiple endings\" may annoy some viewers, it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden, splashy finale. And whether they have a happy or sad ending, Jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle Sauron.\"Return of the King\" brings the epic \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy to a close, and cements Jackson's reputation as a master filmmaker. With the outstanding cast, beautiful scripting and amazing direction, this is the best of the \"Lord\" films -- and that's saying something.",

        "body":"Every tale embarks us on a new journey, every journey eventually comes to its inevitable end. As for The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring turned out to be a genre-defining classic. The Two Towers somehow raised the bar to an even higher level. And although it did seem near- impossible for The Return of the King to triumph over such towering expectations but against all odds, this final journey of Middle-Earth delivers everything to bring J.R.R. Tolkien's legendary saga to an epic & magnificent conclusion.The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the culmination of the wonderful journey we embarked on with The Fellowship of the Ring & picks up the story right from where it was left off in The Two Towers. The story finds Frodo & Sam continuing their quest towards Mount Doom in order to destroy the One Ring while the rest of the fellowship prepares for their final battle as the dark lord Sauron turns his eye on Gondor. But in the end, it all comes down to Frodo & the One Ring to decide the final fate of Middle- Earth.Directed by Peter Jackson, this remains his finest directional achievement & The Lord of the Rings as a whole is certainly his magnum opus. Making all films in a trilogy succeed on every scale is no mere achievement but to make the next instalment work better than its predecessor two times in a row is even rarer. And yet, Jackson manages to accomplish exactly that with his sweeping cinematic vision, stunning eye for detail & in-depth knowledge of balancing emotional storytelling with large-scale action entertainment.The screenplay is cleverly adapted from the source material as many right choices were made in the decision of what to include & what to leave out from the final script. Fran Walsh also tries her hand at direction as the opening prologue is her creation. Being the final film in the trilogy, there's a sense of urgency in this chapter but it still ties up all the loose ends appropriately, gives proper farewells to its characters & delivers a high-quality entertainment of such epic proportions that fans couldn't have asked for a better finale.Coming to the technical aspects, Production design adds even more amazing & meticulously detailed sets to its story, the dazzling cinematography further magnifies the visual presentation to make the cinematic experience even more magical and Howard Shore's epic score is filled with tracks that are truly imposing, beautiful & further expand the domain of its predecessors as the soundtrack of The Lord of the Rings remains the greatest work of his illustrious career.VFX is once again its most groundbreaking feat, however, this time it isn't a slight advancement but a pretty huge leap. Everything that made its brief appearance in the first two chapters is fully explored in this finale plus the length, scope & magnitude of battle sequences it offers is second to none. Also, with better rendering of its CGI characters & stunning level of craftsmanship in costumes, make-up & sound, The Return of the King sets a new benchmark for visuals in cinema that remains unequaled, as of today, in the scope of how much it contributed to the film's art while elevating the whole story.Despite running at 201 minutes, there were many things which got omitted from the theatrical cut & that's why the extended edition is more recommended. Also, many happen to criticize the last 45 minutes it takes to finally end but if you ever watch The Lord of the Rings in one sitting, then it'll make perfect sense to you because not only is it a reasonably enough time to recover the audience from what is an emotionally draining experience but also provides proper farewells that each one of its characters deserved.Coming to the performances, The Fellowship of the Ring & The Two Towers introduced almost all characters we needed to be acquainted with & The Return of the King simply brings their arcs to completion. Unlike the previous two films in which Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) & Gollum (Andy Serkis) turned out to be the most impressive characters, respectively, there is no single dominating performance in this chapter as its entire cast puts up a more mature on-screen portrayal of their respective characters & never really leaves anything major to complain about.J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is unanimously hailed by critics & readers alike as the greatest fantasy novel ever written & a milestone in the works of literature. And it's amazing that its film adaptation follows the same route in the world of cinema. It did catapult Peter Jackson into the big leagues of Hollywood while also setting up Weta Digital as one of the foremost VFX studios on the planet but where it made its biggest impact is on cinema itself for it changed everything there ever was about epic & fantasy filmmaking, is one of the most important films of the modern era & a landmark moment in the annals of cinema.On an overall scale, The Return of the King is more than just a fitting conclusion to The Lord of the Rings. It triumphs as one of the greatest sequels ever made but along with The Fellowship of the Ring & The Two Towers, it also makes up for cinema's greatest motion picture trilogy that will not soon, if ever, find its equal. An unprecedented achievement in the world of filmmaking that's epic in every sense of the word, The Lord of the Rings, in some ways, is to cinema what its source material was to literature & it is destined to remain a standard by which all future film trilogies will be measured for decades to come.",

The breadth and scope of 'The Lord of the Rings' amazes me every time I pick up the novel. The character dialogue is long, eloquent, and puts the reader in a grander time and place than his own. The story is about traveling with friends, talking over dinner, and exploring a world unlike anywhere else in literature. But Jackson's movie has very little of any of that.I understand that because of the cost of the movie, he had to adjust it for mainstream audiences. However, the problem is not that he adjusted the material, but that he absolutely butchered it. Tolkien's beautiful dialogue is trimmed down and thrown away to be replaced by bad one-liners and soap opera scenes. The characters feel one-dimensional and act like cardboard cut outs of their alter egos in the book. Does Frodo panting or groaning or complaining for the hundredth time tell me anything about him or why I should care that he's panting and groaning, etc?I don't hate everything about Jackson's interpretation. I enjoyed the wonderful sets, realistic cgi, and thrilling battle scenes. But was it necessary to make the Battle of Plennor Fields an hour long computer simulate scrimmage when Tolkien spends only a single page describing it in his book? It's a pity mainstream audiences have swallowed the movie and accepted it as a masterpiece, when really it's nothing of the sort. It's a real shame.",

You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in \"The Shawshank Redemption;\" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Citizen Kane.\" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1\/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.",

        "body":"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.",

And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.  Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.  Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.  Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.  You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.",

        "body":"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.",

It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone.",

Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people \"will\" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.",

The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.",

The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it.

When I say \"The Movie\", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about.  In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those \"Budget Theaters\" over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said \"That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!\" There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... \"HOPE\".  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just \"comes together\" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a \"must buy\" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, \"That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!\"  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my \"favorite of all time\", but they've all fallen far short of \"The Shawshank Redemption\". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the \"employee picks\" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!",

When I thought about it, though, it made more sense--this is a \"Rocky\"-type feel-good movie that doesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don't get me wrong--it's a fine film (I gave it a solid 7 out of 10), it's just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_ and _The Graduate_.I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who isn't a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt, bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict who knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside, and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King, who doesn't really do well with complex characters (a problem I noted as far back as _Carrie_).If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either _The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think, go with the late great Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_.I couldn't stop thinking about the warden: doesn't he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.I'm not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product with nothing special to commend it.",

Eventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDb's top 250 movies of all time list, it hit number 1 with over one million votes.The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As the years go on in his new home he makes friends, enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history.I love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion. The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.

A story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) getting falsely convicted of murder and sent to the hellish Shawshank prison, the movie is beyond amazing. In prison, Andy meets Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who was imprisoned many years earlier. Red gets Andy a poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the next twenty years, Andy experiences all the horrors that one would expect in jail: beatings by the guards, rapes by other inmates, and so on. But he never gives up hope.This movie, like \"Carrie\", \"The Shining\", \"Dolores Claiborne\", \"The Green Mile\" and \"Hearts in Atlantis\", just goes to show what a great author Stephen King is. When we think of horror, we think of spooky horror, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a different kind: personal horror. Pure genius.

Redemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life.

Afterall Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are quite well-known actors. Frank Darabont however only just caught my attention in 1999, when 'the Green Mile' was released. Finally I came to the conclusion that it must have been either television, because it surely isn't on television often enough, or it could just be me, not knowing very much about the film-world before 1995. For in fact, everyone in my school seemed to have known 'the Shawshank Redemption' for a very long time. \"One of the best movies ever\", my best friend said, \"My favorite movie in the whole wide world\", another one of my friends.

The acting is superior, some of Tim Robbins' and Morgan Freeman's best work as they allow me an intimate look inside the sometimes contradictory nature of a convict's existence, where I am torn emotionally between danger and safety, light and shadow, sanity and sorrow, truth and lies, injustice and justice. In fact, I am lost in all the actors' poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs, cruel guards, swindlers, thieves, rapists and murders, all standing in their respective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a loudspeaker on the prison yard.In this movie, I find almost no one to be all good or all bad. There are exceptions, though. Although there are those in charge of the prison I wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse, there are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes I cheer on to win in the end. Like people in real life, most of the characters in \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" both prisoners and guards (those that are not miserably rotten to the bone), represent many shades of gray.One of the most touching moments in \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a scene in which an elderly convict, who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up, is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories. And his fear of this new and unnatural terrain, crawling with shadier creatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of a thousand horseless carriages rushing past, engulfed him with no hope of ever escaping.\"Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free,\" from \"The Shawshank Redemption.\"As bonds form between people of different ethnic groups, economic backgrounds and intellectual levels, I rejoice in their discovery of the human dignity they share. As the story unfolds, my heart hurts so hard, I cry. Then, with tears still in my eyes, I laugh, the same way my family used to laugh together at dinner or a movie when I was a little girl.Getting older. Times changing. People leaving. Dying. But at the core of the main character's spirit there shines upon all those who are within its range, including me, a contagious hope eternal. I am still astonished with the euphoria that fills my being each time I view this incredible story about the invincible human spirit.",

But the whole premise of life inside a prison cell makes better sense when told in a calm, emotion-building, pace such as this. Otherwise, one would never get to know Tim Robbins's quiet accountant (and what makes him appear alternately shy, snobbish, and suicidal all at the same time); or Morgan Freeman's genial-but-cynical lifer- not to mention how he's \"a man who knows how to get things.\" I love what the film doesn't do: it doesn't make an issue of its two leads being different races (although one could claim that makes their friendship all the more marvelous), it doesn't pull any sensational, far-out, action punches (as films with an all-male cast often do), and it doesn't freeze its characters into types. Everyone is real and everyone is flawed- from James Whitmore's bird loving veteran to Bob Gunton's pretentious, icy, warden. But the finish (which really starts around the film's last twenty minutes) is one of the most powerful and moving things ever committed to film. Get it in either format.",

It has a non linear editing style with a heavy synthetized bass soundtrack accompanying the shaky visuals. After the first chapter's dull horror, I realized this movie is different because of its non linear editing so this mystery kept me going. If not, I wanted to leave the theater because of messy indie movie scenes that I have watched maybe ten thousand times.Main characters were greatly portrayed and shaky cinematography turned into a neonish drug fueled nightmare when the movie's twist was served. Was it good enough? It obviously was that this low budget indie found its way in various movie theaters all around the world... But is it a horror masterpiece? Absolutely not.

What amazing performances.I recommend going in knowing as little as possible, making the ride that much more enjoyable.I normally roll my eyes when I see a movie uselessly split into chapters. In Strange Darling, the chapters actually serve a purpose. With this nonlinear storytelling, the movie leaves us constantly intrigued. The perfect order maximizes the impact. It gave me Christopher Nolan vibes.I was already familiar with Kyle Gallner, whose career continues to ascend. He's always convincing and this might be his best performance yet. But Willa Fitzgerald... who is this?!?!? Best performance I've seen all year. She needs more leading roles ASAP. And with several long shots of these performances, it's a beautiful display of their talent levels.I regularly watch blockbusters and frequently enjoy studio-manufactured movies. But something about Strange Darling is so refreshing. It feels like genuine art, crafted by artists, and unadulterated by studio contaminants.And yet it doesn't devolve into the typical Oscar-bait, style-over-substance \"high art\" that critics love. It's highly entertaining and rewatchable with several jaw-dropping moments.I had a blast with this movie. It's currently my favorite movie of the year and is significantly better than the overhyped Longlegs (a movie I still enjoyed), or the nonsensical Cuckoo.(2 viewings, early access screening 8\/14\/2024, 9\/4\/2024)",

        "body":"Strange Darling is a mesmerizing psychological horror, told in a non-linear sequence that brilliantly enhances its tension and complexity. The film unravels in six chapters-4, 1, 5...and, surprisingly, this disjointed structure works in its favor, drawing you deeper into a gorgeous twisted nightmare.From the get-go, this film doesn't shy away from violence, delivering lengthy and often brutal scenes that keep you on edge. Kyle Gallner's performance is a standout; his portrayal of The Demon is as hot as it is transformative, taking you on a rollercoaster of emotions as his character's layers get peeled back.The Lady, played with eerie curiousity by Willa Fitzgerald, is one of the most complicated and fascinating characters in recent memory. Her personality is so compelling that it's difficult to take your eyes off her.Visually, Strange Darling is exemplary for modern horror films. The deep neon blues reminiscent of Mulholland Drive and the vibrant pinks that echo Climax create a dreamlike atmosphere, beautifully complemented by Giovanni Ribisi's debut work as a cinematographer-nothing is wasted. The fact that it was shot on film adds a rich texture to the movie, vibrant saturation, making the horror elements strangely beautiful.The film also delves into themes of kink and consent, handling them with a nuanced touch that's as intriguing as it is respectful. There's a dark romance at its core, exploring the toxic love, addiction, metal illness, and the desperate search for genuine connection. It's a story that resonates deeply with anyone who has experienced a loving relationship that took a sudden, disastrous turn.The film's seamless flow between non-linear scenes is achieved through a rhythmic editing of its piano music and soothing vocals. This sing-song approach also enhances the film's hypnotic vibes. The relaxing original songs contrast shocking violence, amplifying the unsettling and delightfully gory moments.Strange Darling is captivating with its rich colors, dreamlike cinematography, non-linear structure, and compelling characters. It is a must watch for anyone into indie horror films, but be careful to avoid spoilers.",

Why has the director only made two real movies so far? Why did the movie start with a big lie? Well, that wasn't so bad, but it really could have been avoided. All of this shows that I really liked the movie, it was very exciting and I found out a lot of meanings in it, whether the director intended them or not. Original direction that you don't see very often with lots of twist and the ending didnt disappoint me.. As always, I mention that I don't always feel like writing reviews, but some movies make me really want to, and this is one of those movies.",

JT Mollner has crafted a movie that feels reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino's signature style while standing entirely on its own. It's a thrilling journey, filled with jaw-dropping moments that keep you on the edge of your seat.The choice to tell the story in a non-linear narrative is brilliant, adding layers of complexity and intrigue. As a viewer, you're taken on a whirlwind of emotions and revelations, making for an unforgettable cinematic experience.The directorial style is just as strong as the writing. Mollner's vision is sharp, confident, and captivating. I wasn't familiar with his work before this, but I'll definitely be following his career closely from now on.",

We need more movies like this. I don't want to say much more and ruin it for others. Let's just say it felt like it was basically just a movie made for Quentin Tarantino in post modern fashion. It sort of feels like the director is just waving at Quentin and using a lot of his tricks rather than coming up with his own. I didn't mind it completely since Quentin is my favorite director, but it definitely has his style.",

        "body":"Watching Strange Darling was an exceedingly strange experience for me. On one hand, I was astounding by its ability to continuously subvert expectations and construct subtle messaging that is unique (and perhaps even outright important). On the other hand, taken as a straight-up film, Strange Darling is nothing to write home about (other than some impressive cinematography).For a very basic overview, the film tells the story of The Lady (Willa Fitzgerald) being chased by The Demon (Kyle Gallner) in an oft-bloody, sometimes funny, always pulse-pounding cat-and-mouse game. The narrative is told in six chapters--but they are sequenced out-of-order by writer\/director JT Mollner.One thing to mention right away: Strange Darling truly does feature some of the most unique (if not outright best) visuals and camerawork from DOP Giovanni Ribisi that you'll have seen in quite some time. Every scene is extremely colorful and each chapter has its own flair. In a certain sense, the movie is \"worth it\" for this alone.The hallmark (for better or worse) of Strange Darling, however, will be its under-the-surface social messaging. I can understand why some will reject it altogether. I won't spoil things outright here, but right now we live in a society that reacts to certain situations--especially when it comes to gender dynamics--in fairly usual patterns. There are underlying reasons for this--such as the pendulum having been swung too far in the opposite direction for too long. But what Mollner does here is question the current set of off-the-cuff assumptions and show how\/why things may not always be what they seem without the proper common sense or context applied.Like I said, I can see how Strange Darling could be interpreted as hostile\/harmful to female perceptions--but I honestly did not get any feeling of ill will while watching. Instead, I more felt like Mollner was using the genres of thriller and satire to get the point across. I took it as more \"food for thought\" than anything set-in-stone philosophically.That being said, the ceiling of Strange Darling may be that once all the chapters are given proper context the surface narrative is a bit underwhelming. Exciting and well-shot? Certainly. Well-acted too. But when the underlying principles of the project so vastly outweighed the face-value actions, it is tough for me to call the film \"great\".Overall, I settled on 7\/10 stars. Solid--not bad in any sense--but also somewhat capped from being spectacular. As long as you are okay with being challenged by its non-PC messaging and enjoy new cinematic visuals, you'll find something to like here.",

I know I caught this fairly late, but I thought it was such a brilliantly twisted take on a serial-killer-thriller. It explores erotica in a contemporary way, discusses the notion of consent, plays with our heads quite a bit, chooses a non-linear storytelling style to conceal some clever twists (until the right moment, i.e.), and offers some gory surprises along the way. The last 15-20 minutes may not necessarily live up to the promise held by the rest of the film, though I'm not complaining whatsoever. This is a Willa Fitzgerald showcase, and a very good one at that. I also loved the way the film has been shot (..on 35 mm film.. hello, DoP Giovanni Ribisi?) and graded.

        "body":"\"Strange Darling\" is a chilling horror film that delivers on both scares and character-driven drama. Willa Fitzgerald and Kyle Gallner deliver powerhouse performances in this twisted tale that keeps you guessing until the very end.The film follows a young woman named Emily (Fitzgerald) who becomes entangled with a mysterious stranger, Thomas (Gallner). Their chance encounter quickly spirals into a dangerous obsession, leading to a series of events that are both shocking and unsettling.What sets Strange Darling apart is its ability to build suspense and tension without relying solely on jump scares. The psychological horror is just as terrifying as the physical threats. The film delves into themes of isolation, obsession, and the darkness that lurks within us all.The film defies conventional storytelling. By expertly weaving together fragments of a disturbing narrative out of sequence, director JT Mollner creates a suspenseful and thought-provoking experience. The film's out-of-sequence storytelling is a stroke of genius. By jumping back and forth in time, the director creates a puzzle that the audience must piece together. This approach keeps the viewer engaged and constantly questioning the motives and actions of the characters. The non-linear narrative also adds a layer of ambiguity to the film, making it impossible to predict what will happen next.The atmosphere of \"Strange Darling\" is dark and oppressive, perfectly capturing the sense of dread and unease that permeates the story. Fitzgerald and Gallner have incredible chemistry, creating a palpable tension between their characters. Their performances are raw and emotionally charged, making the audience feel their pain, fear, and desperation. The film's atmospheric cinematography and haunting score create a palpable sense of dread. The tension builds slowly and steadily, culminating in a series of shocking revelations that will leave you breathless. While the film's pacing may be slow at times, the payoff is well worth the wait.",

        "body":"Strange Darling is a captivating horror thriller that keeps you guessing with its twists and turns, evoking a range of emotions and surprises that will keep you engaged. While primarily a psychological thriller, the film's intricate storytelling and deep character development make genre categorisation difficult. The narrative centres around an encounter that escalates into a series of nightmarish events, with each twist challenging your perceptions and expectations. Watching this film without prior knowledge enhances the viewing experience, as its unexpected plot developments rely on the element of surprise. To avoid spoilers, I'll keep this review vague. It's best to go in blind for impact.The storyline of Stranger Darling expertly builds tension, drawing you in slowly before ramping up the suspense with unexpected and intense moments. The deliberate pacing may seem slow at times. But it effectively heightens the sense of anticipation throughout. As the plot unravels, it becomes evident that the director skilfully manipulates our expectations. You feel like you're heading one way only to suddenly find yourself in a very different, more unsettling reality. The mood is sombre and ominous, with subtle (and not so subtle) hints of something eerie lurking beneath the surface.One of the standout features of Stranger Darling is its technical quality. The cinematography is captivating, using shadows and light to evoke a sense of unease. The colour scheme is subdued, punctuated by touches of red that suggest violence. The visual aesthetic perfectly complements the narrative, with each shot crafted to build suspense. Close-up shots during intense moments allow you to experience the characters fear and desperation on a visceral level.The performances also shine in this film. While the cast may not feature A-list celebrities, they deliver portrayals that anchor the story's more surreal elements. The lead actor's depiction of a character teetering on the brink of madness is particularly striking. There's a rawness to their acting that renders the characters descent into insanity, both plausible and heart wrenching. The supporting cast also excels, infusing depth and nuance into their roles. Seemingly minor characters possess complexity that enriches the overall impact of the film.The movie's music perfectly complements its atmosphere. The soundtrack is haunting, with jarring notes that keep you on edge. It's not the type of music you'll find yourself humming later. It greatly enhances the film's mood. The editing is precise, with cuts that contribute to the disorienting nature of the plot. At times, the editing becomes almost frantic, reflecting the characters inner struggles and intensifying the feeling of chaos.Symbolism plays a role in Strange Darling, incorporating various recurring themes that enrich the storyline. The use of mirrors, for instance, is especially impactful in representing the characters' duality and blurring the line between reality and madness. The production design also deserves recognition for its slightly unsettling sets that contribute to an overall feeling of unease.All that being said, there are aspects of the film that may not appeal to everyone based on individual preferences. While the pacing is generally effective, there are moments in the middle where it slows down, which could test some viewers patience. Additionally, there are instances where the plot feels overly complex, with twists that appear intended to shock rather than advance the narrative. However, these issues are minor concerns in an otherwise well-crafted and captivating movie.Strange Darling bears some resemblance to psychological thrillers, yet it manages to establish its own unique identity within the genre. Viewers who enjoy films like Shutter Island or The Others will discover much to admire, while even those not typically inclined towards this genre might find themselves engrossed by the unexpected twists and intricate plot developments of Strange Darling. It's an experience that rewards patience and careful observation, leaving lasting impressions that linger in your thoughts well beyond the closing credits.A suspenseful and evocative thriller, Strange Darling delivers more than enough to validate its position in the genre. Though not perfect, the film's strengths far outweigh its flaws, making it a must-see for thriller enthusiasts. Just remember-approach it with no prior knowledge for a truly exhilarating journey. With its performances, eerie visuals, and a storyline that keeps you on edge, this is a movie that will stay with you long after you exit the theatre. And a warning: Strange Darling definitely earns its MA15+ rating! So be prepared.",

The director sets out to give us a sincere drama without limiting herself in any way, destroying relationships, destroying worlds and destroying realities, all of that handled with the subtlety of a very good director who also stars in her own script, which leads us to feel with all the intensity this drama that she offers us.It is helped by a cast that is also committed, where Pål Sverre Hagen and Sigrid Johnson stand out. Each character has something to tell and something to face their own fears and regrets with, that intensity put into each scene is what captivates us as spectators and at the same time its director is intelligent in not risking anything improper, Bornebusch touches the conventional keys of how to conquer the spectator, but she does it in an authentic way and without looking for anything easy, she does it with a correct look at an intense drama that breaks you as it reaches its final climax where you sense that everything will break definitively.We are faced with a sad, moving and deeply heartbreaking story that hides nothing and gives you a true story that keeps coming back to you as everything happens. The moments of happiness, especially well placed thanks to intelligent humor, are part of the dose of relief from a deep drama full of sadness and everything that allows you to experience a process of emotions and tears that break the deepest heart of any viewer.A brave film that, in its well-used conventionality, manages to hit the nail on the head as one of the pleasant and saddest dramas of 2024. Its director continues to demonstrate her directing skills, but also her good work in front of the screen, an interesting proposal that is worth giving a chance to move you and enjoy life's blows.",

They bring depth to their roles, allowing viewers to see the characters' vulnerabilities, triumphs, and regrets.

Instead, it focuses on real-life moments, showing how joy and despair often sit side-by-side in the human experience. This approach underscores a central theme: life is neither inherently good nor bad but is shaped by the choices we make. Through its portrayal of life's duality, \"Let Go\" reminds us that we have the power to find beauty even in hardship or to create tragedy through poor decisions. It's a movie that encourages introspection, inviting viewers to consider the influence of their own choices on their happiness and sense of fulfillment.In short, \"Let Go\" is a gem that balances simplicity with depth, illustrating how our lives are ultimately defined by the decisions we make.

        "body":"I did not expect this movie to be this good! Josephine Bornebusch did a great job here hence my very high rating. She wrote, directed and was the leading actress performing as Stella, a mother who when faced with chaos and uncertainty in her family, chose the path of unity and reconciliation. She did this with strong conviction despite her opposing husband. I do not come across such a performance that often. She deserves all the praise for her contribution to this movie.The movie, which is originally in Swedish, is about family relationships, parenthood, love, sickness, betrayal, and responsibilities. The plot is nicely written, and music chosen is spot on. Pål Sverre Hagen playing as Gustav, Stella's husband and Sigrid Johnson playing as Anna, their daughter performed really well too.In my opinion, it is a good contender for the International Feature Film Award at the 2025 Oscars!",

        "body":"I'll admit it, even though I am in my early 30s, I still enjoy watching animated movies, and animated shows. Sometimes I think there are certain things with animated films that can't be done with live-action movies, or maybe I'm wrong on that. Anway, Ok, Migration, the duck movie, or is it mallards the preferred word? No idea, not exactly an expert on ducks here, , anyway, I just saw it at my local movie theater, went to a 11:55 am showing, and I'll say this, I felt actually surprised. Does this movie do anything groundbreaking or anything that changes the landscape of animated movies going forward? No. However, I genuinely enjoyed it. Ok, maybe the plot is kind of simple, a few members of a duck family, including the mother duck wants to migrate, to explore the world, to see more outside their pond and see what more whats beyond her pond. The Dad duck, Mack voiced by Kumail Nanjiani , he has so many good lines in this movie. Mack is not really willing or wanting to explore anything behind his pond, his known \"comfort zone.\" The mom duck , Pam, and their kids, Dax, and. Gwen help Mack understand reason they have to. And what happens next is a journey of encounters with friendly or not friendly other animals along the way, madcap adventures, getting lost a few times, along the way, an accidental visit to New York City and a wise-cracking pigeon leader, and so much more, which I promise I will not spoil for anybody who does decide to go see this in the movie theater. I personally had a good time watching it, made me smile, made me laugh, the animation is very good, I like the characters. Danny DeVito voices Uncle Dan, he is such a very funny, caring older Uncle and he usually says whatever comes to mind, he has some good lines too. Elizabeth Banks as Pam, mother duck , is a character who longs to explore a world outside her pond, and wants to have more experiences than just being stuck in one place, I liked her character quite a bit. Dax is a pretty awesome character, he is the younger duck, who keeps wanting to help his Dad and keeps wanting to explore try new things no matter the risk , but keeps getting told, not help, to mostly stay out of the way, until something he does at the end, not going to say anymore on that. And Gwen , is the sister, to Dax, oh my goodness, Gwen is super charming, a huge highlight of the movie I think. Gwen has this moment later in the movie, where she goes to her brother, Dax, and gives him a hug, and keeps hugging him, to comfort her brother, after Dax walks away from his family after something happens. It felt like something an actual sister would do to help comfort her brother, I think. Overall really enjoyed it, wasn't really excepting much going in to see it, felt genuinely surprised, very heartfelt and just a fun good movie. Two thumbs up. Or two webbed feet up?I think I should rank the animated movies I have seen this year,1: Boy and the Heron\n2: Across the Spider-Verse\n3: Migration\n4: Teenage Turtle Mutant Turtles Mayhem\n5: Super Mario.",

        "body":"'Migration' is a really well-made family film. It's a simple premise about anthropomorphic ducks - the father duck, Mack (Nanjiani), wants to protect his children\/chicks, Dax (Jennings) and Gwen (Gazal), and the mother duck, Pam (Banks), wants them to experience the world and gain some experience. They meet some other ducks migrating south for the winter - they're presumably in North-Eastern USA - so they decide to do the same, with quirky uncle Dan (DeVito) in tow.What follows is both a semi-familiar road-trip comedy, as well as a refreshing take on family, trying new things and helping others. There's a great support cast, as the duck family passes through New York City and meets Chump the pigeon (Awkwafina), Delroy the macaw (Key), as well as Erin the heron (Kane) and GooGoo (Mitchell) - either a goose or a white duck. There's a nice jail-break sequence for Delroy, which sets up the human antagonist, the Chef.For some reason the Chef also has a Chinook and hunts them down, leading to Dax and Gwen having to step-up. The animation is a nice mix of cartoonish and realistic, and it looks excellent, especially at the end. There's no overly-scary moments, some teachable themes, the voice cast is all good and there's consistent laughs throughout. There's also 'Mooned', the 9-min 'Despicable Me' tie-in at the start of the film, which kids seemed to love.",

The storyline follows a northeastern family of ducks 🦆 who encounter a flock of migrating birds that invite them to fly south for the winter. Despite their usual winter stay, the family convinces the dad to fly to Jamaica 🇯🇲 this year, and an adventure ensues.This movie is co-directed by Benjamin Renner (Ernest & Celestine) and Guylo Homsy (Eddie's Life Coach) and features the voices of Kumail Nanjiani (Stuber), Danny DeVito (Twins), Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians), Keegan-Michael Key (Wonka), and Elizabeth Banks (The Hunger Games).The animation in this picture is outstanding, while the rest of the film is fairly average. The storyline is straightforward, with a few worthwhile subplots. I particularly enjoyed the husband and wife working together through various circumstances for the betterment of the family. The voices are well selected, and Awkwafina and DeVito comedic content keep the film well-paced. The conclusion is as expected, though its sequel potential remains uncertain.In conclusion, Migration is a fun family animated picture with enough worthwhile elements to make it worth a watch, but it doesn't stand out in the genre.

        "body":"If there's one thing I took away from Migration (2023), it's that Illumination has finally matured as an animation studio. Sure, just like there's a Disney\/Pixar\/DreamWorks \"style,\" Illumination has a look to the characters in their movies (especially the humans) that makes them immediately distinguishable. In Migration, there was less of that distinctive style, but the freedom to match what the movie needed to tell its original story about a family adventure. If this is what taking risks looks like, then I think it was a successful foray into more original fare.The voice acting was superb, mostly because there were only a few characters whose voices were immediately obvious who they were. I do wonder if director Benjamin Renner's previous work, Ernest & Celestine (2012), helped shape some of the voice acting decisions, because they certainly fit the characters well. The animation also feeling closer to a 2D traditionally animated film while still being completely 3D CGI was a nice touch that set it apart from other animated movies (but not quite as extremely as Into the Spider-Verse (2018) or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023) have done).And while the plot wasn't anything to fly home about, the core lessons it was trying to get across were solid enough for any kids watching to understand what it was trying to say. Even the more childish gags that are common for this kind of film were fairly rare, which felt refreshing considering the studio this film came from. Of course, this also was helped by a pretty good villain that drove most of the movie's later conflict. Kids might be scared at a few points, but my daughter seemed to enjoy it overall.A cute family adventure from Illumination, I give Migration 3.5 stars out of 5.",

It's a stuffed story, with multiple story lines, that in its most parts contain the anxiety of parents and the will to let the children fly out of the nest.It's a duck tale and it's about all those generic themes you can think about. A little bit of \"Ice Age 3\" and a sprinkle from other kids' movies and there you got it.The pond is getting a shirt visit from migrating ducks and those who have never left their steady home get curious and wondering what else is there in life except the good old pond.The neurotic father duck cannot think about him and his family living the dangers of wild life and they get into the big city and get their fair share of adventures. Its a wonderfully written, directed and performed animated movie for both kids and grown-ups.It speaks about our natural anxieties as parents and about the will to explore and go in the path each individual carves for himself. No big news or subversive subtext, just fun time with the kids and thus medium we like to have fun with then occasionally.The cast members are also fun with Supporting roles like Keagen-Michael key, Awkwafina and Danny DeVito.

        "body":"In a forest in the Northeastern America, the Mallard family consisting of Mack (Kumail Nanjiani), his wife Pam (Elizabeth Banks), and their two children Dax (Casper Jennings) and Gwen (Tresi Gazal) live a pleasant but unadventurous life in their pond home mainly due to Mack's anxieties about the outside world. When a flock of migrating ducks stop by and tell Mack's family of their destination of Jamaica, Mack brushes initially brushes off the idea despite his family's objections until talking with his even more risk averse Uncle Dan (Danny DeVito) changes his mind. As the Mallard family begins their migration, they make their way South encountering various misadventures along the way.Migration is the latest animated feature from Universal based studio Illumination and the first 3D animated film from director Benjamin Renner who had previously garnered acclaim from traditionally animated films such as Ernest & Celestine and The Big Bad Fox and Other Tales. While Migration certainly covers familiar ground when it comes to this kind of story, its familiarity is mad more palatable thanks to some solid visual craft as well as some good performances from the voice actors.While I'll admit I did approach Migration with a certain level of skepticism as the marketing did feel like it was selling a movie in line with something like Rio or Duck Duck Goose, I was pleasantly surprised by how it avoided common pitfalls associated with this kind of broadly targeted animated format. While the family certainly fall into archetypes with the anxiety ridden father and the mother being more adventurous, the chemistry between Nanjiani and Banks in the roles brings a lot of energy and believability to their dynamic. The two children Dax and Gwen are also voiced by Caspar Jennings and Tresi Gazal also do a good job of capturing a surprisingly more believable brother\/sister dynamic with some charming scenes such as when Gwen tags along with Dax or won't stop hugging him until he feels better.One of the qualities I really appreciated Renner's approach to the material was despite existing in a setting with humans they never talk with the only speech coming from the birds themselves. This helps create a solid sense of identity for the film that really sold it for me especially in regards to the main antagonist a nameless chef who's an amalgam of various celebrity chefs whose character is created almost entirely through pantomime and the animation. Renner also worked to avoid many of the more base and lazy jokes he felt were too prevalent in family films and it really did feel like the humor was more character and situation based. With that said this is a very straightforward \"road movie\" with more than a few shades of prior films of this ilk and I wouldn't say there's any major risks it takes, but despite maybe playing its narrative a bit too safe it makes for fun diverting viewing.Migration doesn't reach the heights of the bar director Renner has set for himself, but as a diverting bit of lighthearted escapism it's above average. In a year that hasn't been a slouch where animation has been concerned (Nimona, Across the Spider-Verse) Migration is in good company and is a solid work even if not particularly ambitious.",

Our 10 year old was not entertained but our 6 year old liked it.In the theater, very few jokes landed with an audience response. The short shown prior to the movie is a more worthwhile watch. This movie is completely forgettable. In a world of sugar cookie shakes, this movie is as vanilla (and formulary) as it gets. It's devoid of any substance or soul, a formulary family vanilla shake, hold the whip and sprinkles. Of the nine family films I've seen in testers this year, it's the one I'd recommend the least.",

Unfortunately, the rest of the movie had trouble getting me to even chuckle. The comedy is weak.On top of that, this movie is surprisingly dumb. There are so many questionable moments. Major impediments are solved in the most nonsensical, made up ways. Things seem to happen because the script says so. It doesn't feel natural.If you are just looking for something to watch with the kids, Migration is fine. Children won't care about my complaints.

        "body":"I do like the animation studio Illumination's movies, and though I was not sure what to expect from this movie, I still was thinking it was going to be a normal family animated movie that has very good animation and good voice cast; after watching, I was right about what I thought, but this movie was enjoyable and pretty entertaining to watch. Illumination's animated movie Migration (2023) is an enjoyable family movie with pretty animation, a good voice cast, quite a few funny moments, and a simple premise following ducks migrating; this not one of Illumination's best movies, but it was at good enough to watch and have a suitable time watching it.The movie has a good voice cast involving Kumail Nanjiani, Elizabeth Banks, Danny DeVito, Awkwafina, and Keegan-Michael Key, who are all good in the movie and have funny scenes in the movie; I like the simple idea of the duck dad named Mack being pushed out of his comfort zone and migrating so him and his family are not stuck in one place, so they learn about places they have never been to. I did think the change from the dad going wanting to stay at the pond to him wanting to go out could have been gradually built up a bit instead of being quickly decided, but that is fine, and it is mostly because the more adventurous mom wanted him to go and pushed him to. Also, though the kids could get a little annoying to watch, they do gradually get less annoying, and they start being helpful as the movie goes on in certain situations they get into.There is a villain in the movie that is just a chef who is trying to get the ducks, but he is introduced in halfway through the movie and continues to follow the ducks from there on; other than the antagonist, the movie did have some funny moments and lines of dialogue, with an occasional moment I was not expecting. The animation of the movie was very pretty to look at with the various locations they go to having nice details and is nice to look at, especially when they are at their pond or in certain forest areas; the ducks themselves have good detail in the feathers they have and the way the move around is fast and fun to watch when they are migrating from location to location.The movie Migration (2023) is not Illumination's best movie, but it is an enjoyable and entertaining family movie, so kids will like this movie; the movie had a good voice cast, pretty animation, funny moments, and the simple premise of ducks migrating is done well enough to make the movie good. This movie will be entertaining for those who have kids and for those who do not, and if you like Illumination's animated movies, then this is not bad of one to check out; not bad but not perfect, just a simple and enjoyable family animated movie.",

And must figure out how to escape. There's a clever dance-step scene here. At one point, of course, they say \"we got this!\"... the re-assuring buzz words of the 2020s. Mack (nanjiani) says right at the start \"we ain't scared of nothing!\" ... which is not good use of the english language. One de-merit for bad grammar! The graphics and colors are just beautiful. The writers spend so much time on certain story points that it's clearly aimed to the kids. Directed by benjamin renner. Story by mike white, of white lotus fame... and of course, chuck and buck.

But many of their works really are just for kids and most of their style and writing is bland and has gotten on my nerves. Migration is new and different from their other works but as a whole, it was average at best.Throughout, many of the animation colors, structures, and models are pretty good as Illumination does a really good work on their animation designs. Including the models, the movements and the features. There are some solid sound designs as well. The writing from Mike White, who is known for his writing works on School of Rock, Year of the Dog, Brad's Status and Nacho Libre, isn't really special and while there are some ideas that I thought were pretty cool, it felt too generic and didn't feel as charming as it thinks which made it pretty boring. People say that it's trying to be original but it almost feels like a more unspecial version of \"Rio\". The director Benjamin Renner has created \"Ernest & Celestine\" and \"The Big Bad Fox and Other Tales...\" which are really great animated stories but unlike his previous works, Renner's direction and charm feels lacking and lost.The voice performances are solid as Kumail Nanjiani and Elizabeth Banks provide some solid emotions and vocal performances. The child voice performances honestly kind of got on my nerves. Most of the characters were typical and not really interesting, the humor is a bit stale and the dialogue is a mix of having some clever and some really awful lines. It's definitely for the younger audiences as my siblings did enjoy it which I am glad about. I do appreciate Illumination Entertainment making something original then their annoying works of Despicable Me and Minions stuff but the generic style doesn't do it for me.Overall, it's good for the children and the average internet user who loves animation but I feel like I should just stop watching movies from Illumination Entertainment at this point.",

Writing credits also go to Benjamin Renner, as well as Mike White.It's already received a nomination for Best Original Score by the HMMA. Keegan-Michael Key recently won the Award for Film Excellence from the MMCG too! Believe it or not, this is the 4th time he has voiced a bird! Those roles were in The Angry Birds, The Star, and Toy Story 4.THINGS I LIKED:\nKudos to Keegan-Michael Key on his performance. He's consistently fantastic in everything he does. If you want to see him in a fun Christmas movie, you should definitely watch Jingle Jangle on Netflix.Awkwafina has now voiced a bird three times after doing Storks (2016) and The Little Mermaid this year.It's great to hear Danny DeVito's voice in an animation. This is only his 2nd time working with Illumination since his 2012 movie The Lorax.I always get a kick out of hearing Carol Kane's unique voice.Other talented voices in the cast include Elizabeth Banks, Kumail Nanjiani, David Mitchell, and Caspar Jennings.There's a lot of visual humor, in addition to the verbal jokes.The musical score was composed by John Powell.The action sequences are almost non-stop.Viewers will get a kick out of being introduced to a lot of characters during the adventure.Overall, the movie is family-friendly, and something the whole fam can do during the holidays.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nI was bored within minutes.I'm REALLY tired of movies that elevate women while simultaneously making men look like buffoons...human or bird.This is the classic kids' movie that makes a lot of noise and keeps them distracted while disinterested parents can wash the dishes and clean the house.So much of the movie is cliched, including the obligatory, happy dance scene celebration at the end of the film.TIPS FOR PARENTS:\nSome physical violence\nDifferent kinds of weapons are used.Lots of talk of cooking animals.Kids might be interested in learning more about Jamaica and where it's located because of what they see in the film.!",

'Migration' is another perfect example. It has a simple story with good characters and excellent animation. I cared about each and every character, and never found any of them annoying.'Migration' is the story of a family of ducks living in a pond. Mac, the head of the family, has no interest in migrating for the winter, or seeing new places for that matter. However, when they meet a flock of migrating ducks, Mac's family wants to migrate too. When Uncle Dan finally convinces Mac it might do them good to experience new adventures, Mac agrees. Only, Uncle Dan wants to join. Reluctant at first, Mac agrees, and so the family head out on their first adventure to Jamaica.They meet interesting characters along the way - from seemingly evil herons to a Jamaican parrot! I loved every single character, every adventure, every obstacle, and every moment. The film has a good story and allows for good character development. (Interestingly, the duck farm scenes were so similar to the chicken farm scenes from 'Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget', I'd be interested to know who came up with the idea first, since both movies were released in 2023.)Please, Disney, it's time to take note what Illumination is doing. I absolutely loved 'Migration. This is a beautiful film and there's so much room for a sequel!",

Here I leave you my comment.Migration, a topsy-turvy journey.It was a movie that I had been looking forward to for some time, ever since I saw the trailer. Now, I wasn't expecting anything out of this world... but maybe I wasn't expecting such a basic movie.A prototypical film.If we look at the evolution of the characters, we can see that they comply with certain patterns from the beginning to the end of the film. So the evolution looks natural and the growth of the characters allows them to grow while the film lasts.Although it is very easy to predict everything that may happen from the beginning of the film through characters that are well cohesive, but they are not going to give you anything new.A tabletop movie.Even though it has been released in the cinema, this film should be on one of the streaming platforms (HBO, Netflix, Prime Video...) because it is not worth the price of a cinema ticket.We can find some easy jokes and a romantic couple plot, while the little ones also feel the need to experiment and grow. So it is a film dedicated so that each of the family members can feel represented.My opinion.First of all, I love watching animated movies. However, if you have other options, they will surely be much more interesting than \"Migration, a trip upside down.\" However, if you want to entertain the little ones in the house, it can be a good option.If you are a couple, it is not a movie that is romantic although it has its story of improving the relationship, so something romantic can be considered. As far as you can see it, for a weekend after dinner when you don't want to do anything. And maybe, take a nap.",

It's great attention to detail and part of the magic that animators make.-then comes the human elements in their forms, and what a surprise to see such great adaptations in the small fowl forms is humorous , charming, and just cute at times and brings the energy that this movie thrives on.-Wrap this all together and the smoothness of the animation is going to easily keep your eyes on the festivities of this dynasty in their migration to whatever they are searching for in their journey.-And the design with that goofy look on their faces that Illumination does adds more than takes away, sort of a subtle level that adds funny with little effort.Great Humor\n-A staple to these movies for me is to laugh and hope that I get more than just kid humor and cute sound effects and one liners.-Migration had my back and did not disappoint with the material presented and more so how appropriate it sticks to the rating they gave it.-Yes, there are plenty of the tropes for kids, silly smashing, lots of random lines, and annoying sounds that are going to be repeated.-Yet, the movie feels a bit like Bluey, actually geared towards adults with plenty of their perspective to help color this film in a shade that was far more enjoyable\n-Bed time stories gone wrong to help make a point, sarcasm that just sticks and matches the emotion so well that the combination of visual and sound are unbeatable for me.-And there are even a few jokes hidden within that for you to enjoy and find, that little extra sauce that makes this movie fun for all.-It's also balanced and well implemented, never getting to lost to overshadow everything else this movie achieves, again a part of the fun, not the whole fun that still gives an engaging story.The Opening Short:\n-It's of course geared to the Despicable Me audience, but the small tale and short is very fun and a little side story that curbs you to the Gruniverse.-I enjoyed the simple tale that bridges the gap, adds that silly level of humor found in that movie franchises, and was a nice bridge to warm us up.-One character is a surprise to see, but with them comes a funny Looney Tunes like motion that was very enjoyable, if not a tad long.Family Friendly, But Adult\n-This movie again can mirror the craze of Bluey in my eyes.-It's family friendly, easily watchable by all ages, but yet not so juvenile that older adults are going to be looking at their phones or fingernails to entertain themselves.-That humor I mentioned is one element, but the fact there are such great storytelling elements and character development really help make this movie easily more entertaining and relevant to the masses.-To have that balance helps really give the movie rewatchability to see what else you can find with the wit and cleverness of the animators' imaginations.Good Character Usage\n-And again, a good movie is loaded with engaging characters, and even more so using those characters to justify their inclusion is big for a reviewer like me.-Migration again succeeds in this task, granting you characters that are colorful in look and design, but also in personality and story.-The main flock is of course the stars, but surprisingly there is a lot of secondary characters that get some fantastic screen time, with a purpose and engagement that just doesn't tag them along for the ride.-The antagonist might not say much, but it doesn't matter, because even he has enough merit into his inclusion, and enough menace to fit in without being too much.-It's impressive to see them do this where others struggle, but applause for what hey crammed into about a 90 minute run time.Voice Acting\n-The crown jewel for me is the voices that brought so many characters to life and delivered that comedic punch with the haymaker that had me laughing.-The writing might be good, but I loved the execution as well, with just about everyone delivering solid performance.-DeVito needs more lines, but what he pulls off is perfect for the curmudgeon duck, with just that touch of dry sarcasm and lack of energy that is balanced so well.-Banks was that calming factor, her raspy and controlling voice a nice contrast to help calm the theatrics of the comical birds in this movie, and add that touch of different humor to the mi to help keep things diverse.-However, it is Nanjiani that was the best. His voice was made for an animated dock, so aggressive, high pitched, raspy, and that element of awkward composure that makes the humor so fun. And yet, still has the air of caring that leads to a great character that I enjoyed watching across the board.DISLIKES:More Needed\n-The adventure was great, but again, there seemed to be more needed to finish this migration to the South.-This film did the trick on many levels, but at the end of the movie, the adventure seemed to end a little faster and quicker than I expected.-Surely more things could have been done, or maybe not skip quite as much and lead to three minute montage to get home, especially given one last fun thing that could have been that last touch.-Throw in some of the other characters getting a little more development given the trauma they faced and well... I kind of would have liked to see that execution.-Minor to some, and moderate to others, a little more engaging design, even at the cost of the short, could have helped take this a bit further.Gwen Gets A Tad annoying\n-She might be the most adorable character, but it doesn't mean that she was my favorite.-Gwen's whininess at times is cute, but often is annoying to me, the high squeals, the excessive jokes of embarrassment, and the impatience just grating my nerves.-Her humor is definitely more like a kid focus approach and at times it works, but it was much lost on me and she gets a tad overwhelming for someone like me who just doesn't enjoy bratty kids.More Character Development\n-It started so well and I think that the movie kept most of this up, but... again there was still some elements that needed tinkering.-Some more challenges and merit to take the ducks to a new level and help them not have such an abrupt change.-In this type of movie, it's not quite as important to the key demographic, but with just that touch more story building could have taken this to the level of some of my favorite movies.The VERDICT:\nI really enjoyed my time with Migration, and found this animated feature to be quite engaging for me and many of the members in my showing. The animation is solid, cartoony and goofy, which works to capitalize on the writing and humor loaded into this journey. With that balance of adult and kid, the movie caters to all ages and should assist with making a movie that should keep the attention for the 90 minutes. A sensational voice cast and lots of time with the characters, only further brings out the fun and I really just had a fun time soaring through the skies through this quirky little family. Sure, more development could have helped add that added spice, and there could have been a few more engaging challenges and less Gwen. Yet, the movie still shines as an entertaining piece and I encourage this one in theaters for a fun outing, or at the least a watch at home.My scores are:Animation\/Action\/Adventure: 8.5\nMovie Overall: 8.0.",

It tells the story of a family of ducks, that want to migrate to Jamaica, but instead they end up in New York City, where they meet other types of birds.I thought it was a hilarious film, Danny DeVito carried. The kids will surely love this, it's the perfect family film for the holiday season, lighthearted fun all around. The animation is pitch-perfect, I like how they tried to do something different this time, instead of giving us the usual 3D animation like they have done with literally every other film.A lot of people are complaining about Awkwafina being in this movie, and while I too got extremely annoyed when I heard she was going to be in this, as I find her voice very irritating, I must admit I really did not mind her.",

However, after some persuasion from his brother (Dan, voiced by Danny Devito) he decides to take his family on a journey to Jamaica. And on their way they learn that the outside world is full of dangers but also full of exciting adventure and wonderful sights and sounds.One of my favourite parts of this film is when the ducks get lost in a city and meet a pigeon called Chump (voiced by Awkafina) who tries to show them how to cross a road but keeps getting hit by cars.Another good character in the film is the little duckling, Gwen (voiced by Tresi Gazal) who is very cute and keeps using her cuteness to persuade her family into doing things.However I disliked some parts of this film because they seemed a bit predictable and the ending also seemed a bit rushed.

It also has a message about not being content with where you are, and seeking a little adventure being worth the worry. And more impressive, the dynamic of the husband and wife is at the center of the plot (you'd believe the kids would be driving the movie), so it gave it a fresh feeling for me.

        "body":"'Migration (2023)' is better than I expected it to be. Not great, but better. There are plenty of amusing moments and the animation is nice and lively. The voice cast do a good job with what they're given. The screenplay is pretty much what you expect, but it focuses more on outlandish adventure than family dynamics and character growth. Ordinarily, that would perhaps be a bad thing, but here it sets the affair apart from its more mature and classically themed counterparts. It allows it to focus on being fast, loose and silly, without compromising its heart or conceptual foundation. Having said that, it's never quite silly enough to justify its disregard for some of the more well-established but almost necessary aspects of its genre (particularly when it comes to character arcs). It isn't some irreverent, mile-a-minute laugh riot that can afford to skip over the elements which would ground it as being suitably archetypal and therefore comfortable. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that its missing pieces are technically faults, but they don't really matter all that much because it feels like the flick was only ever going to be so good in the first place and its deviations from its formula allow it to be all the more breezy and marginally more unanticipated than it otherwise might have been. Aesthetically, it's pretty generic and seems like the sort of thing we'd have seen ten years ago, but it all looks good within its own style guide and there's a vibrancy that keeps things fairly interesting. There are also some entertaining action set-pieces that tend to favour long shots, which are satisfyingly cinematic. Having said all that, the feature is undeniably forgettable and doesn't come across as much more than filler until Illumination attempt to get another billion dollars. Even though I'm sure there is, it doesn't feel like there's any real passion in it (except from, perhaps, the passion of animators who surely put in their best effort while hoping they'll eventually get paid properly for it). It's an amiable animated movie, but I won't be thinking about it for very long after I post this.",

Furthermore, that nasty chef is not really a good villain. He has no motivations whatsoever that we care about, and the good guys don't go slaying dragons or have cathartic experiences.

Elaborate camera moves, slow motion, things happening of little or no consequence to the plot, just there to keep the ball rolling towards the next set-piece. The colours were beautiful and the different landscapes were I think the most beautiful parts of the film.Everything else felt like other similar films aimed at the audience south of ten years old. You might see this was written by Mike White and think this will dare to fly a different route but no. This was a film made by consensus from script to screen.Yet again all the children in the showing were laughing and reacting exactly where Illumination wanted them to so they must be doing something right.

You don't have to be a plot savant to figure out what is going on and how it will end, but there are enough comedic moments and well cut scenes to keep you engaged if you are just watching to enjoy some family time. As I read another reviewer state, it's a great watch it and forget it type of move. Entertainment for the sake of entertainment! Having said that, there is the reminder of the importance of family and the struggles of raising teenagers. They hit a few of these points spot on. Make more of these types of movies so I can enjoy them with the family please.",

        "body":"Part action, part comedy, here comes a Mark Wahlberg movie that is both typical for this actor, but also something you likely saw (or close to) in the past. That said, its 2023 and almost everything has been done already, so the real question is this. Is it well done this time? Is it fun? And the answer is yes.The movie take a bit of inspiration in True Lies but put its own spin on family road trip comedy with some \"We are the Millers\" vibe, while injecting some decent action sequences in there.Having a runtime of 2 hours make sure the movie put enough emphasis on the familly relations and developing its characters, wich can be a definite plus, but at the same time i felt the movie dragged a tiny bit in the first half. Maybe 10-15 minutes could had been cut. But it didn't detract from my enjoyment.Mark Wahlberg is definately in pretty solid shape still, wich make his character completely credible, but he ain't no martial artist so seeing him go toe to toe with Lateef Crowder (a Copeira expert) did showcase some of his shortcoming. That said, that scene was meant as a mix of comedy and action and not to be taken too seriously so for most peoples who are not martial arts afficionados, it should not be a problem. The rest of the action including gun scenes were well done.Michelle Monaghan is also pretty solid in her role as the mom of the familly. Charming and charismatic. The kids also got to have enough screen time and developement that they felt usefull and interesting in the story. Every character pretty much as its own arc.Overall its a movie that i taught was pretty enjoyable on a first watch. It is a mix between comedy and action but at the same time since it never fully commit to either side, you can't say its a super funny comedy or a big action movie. It is a bit of everything and it makes for a good story tough.Ultimately not every movie is meant to be watch multiple times and considering Apple TV+ has a pretty limited selection of mainstream original movies (Ghosted being one of the few great ones), it is a welcome addition that both casual viewers and cinephile should enjoy.",

The bed scenes are just okay, which I like since, as I have said, it is just a family-feel-good movie, and it is appropriate for the movie's theme.The casting is perfect; I could sense the connection between the characters and each other, and the interaction of the family is very realistic.The editing is also good, and so far, I have not seen any plot holes. I also love their lines; they wrote the dialogue well. Action scenes are not that repetitive. In that scene where Monaghan broke the bamboo, I really thought she was going to jump, but it was not, and she performed an unexpectable execution.This movie is recommendable and much more exciting compared to the EX4 lol.",

Between the first and last act there is the road trip ala National Lampoon's Vacation and it feels as boring as the real trip possibly would be. A few scenes are inserted to show how the kids and parents are growing to eachother. The film is trying to copy the light hearted touch of True Lies but fails. Is it a bad film? No surprisingly it is entertaining enough to sit along, mainly due to the main characters Mark Wahlberg and the amazing Michelle Monaghan. It's an actrice I don't see much, but she does a great job and it feels there is chemistry between both persons. And Mark Wahlberg never changes and I still love this guy for his commitment.",

        "body":"In the realm of mindless action comedies, \"The Family Plan 2023\" treads a well-worn path, featuring Mark Wahlberg as the protagonist, former elite government assassin Dan. Faced with the resurgence of adversaries from his past, Dan opts for an unconventional escape strategy - packing his wife (Michelle Monaghan), teenage daughter, teenage son, and a surprisingly pivotal character, their 10-month-old baby, into a minivan for an impromptu cross-country road trip to Las Vegas.While the film doesn't break any new ground in terms of its narrative, what elevates it from the run-of-the-mill action comedy is the unexpected star power of the youngest member of the ensemble - the adorable 10-month-old baby. In the midst of explosions, car chases, and typical action sequences, the infant manages to steal the spotlight, providing moments of genuine humor and heart that resonate with audiences.Wahlberg and Monaghan deliver performances true to their seasoned capabilities, injecting charm and charisma into their respective roles as parents navigating the chaos. However, it's the interactions involving the 10-month-old that inject a refreshing element into the formulaic proceedings. The clever use of the baby's innocence and unpredictability adds a layer of authenticity to the family dynamic, serving as the unexpected source of both comedic relief and genuine warmth.Despite the film's adherence to a tried-and-true formula, the endearing presence of the youngest family member helps \"The Family Plan 2023\" rise above the monotony. The action-packed road trip may not offer groundbreaking storytelling, but the delightful twist of placing the spotlight on the 10-month-old character gives this predictable family adventure an endearing and memorable touch, making it a worthwhile watch for those seeking a lighthearted blend of action and family dynamics.",

The attempted seriousness in life-threatening situations failed miserably, with laughably unrealistic scenarios that never worked after adding the comedic tone.

It is comical how he hides people out to kill him from his family, on one occasion by the use of bluetooth and Enya.I only watched this for Mark Wahlberg. Its all a bit predictable. The comic bits are the best. The action is good but found a bit dull.Its no an amazing film or something that will stay with you. But it is a decent film that everyone will like. Its worth a watch at least once.",

I tend to get bored with non-stop action movies that spurt blood constantly and have no actual human characters.

Adolescent angst, mom boredom - yeah, it's a bit pain-by-numbers...but it flew past and I didn't check my watch or wonder when is this gonna end already??? - which is about 90% of the time with the crap the streamers make.

        "body":"I often find myself confusing him with Matt Damon, but in this case, we're talking about Mark Wahlberg, the actor from \"Transformers.\" He takes on the lead role in the recently premiered action film \"Family Plan\" on Apple TV, portraying a former killer and agent.Adding a touch of diversity to the cast is Li Meiqi, an Asian actress who plays a significant supporting antagonist. Undoubtedly, she stands out as one of Hollywood's most stunning Asian female stars. While she's been cast in decorative roles before, her four-year stint in the TV series \"Nikita,\" which started in 2010, has undoubtedly solidified her presence in the competitive realm of Hollywood.The narrative of \"Family Plan\" unfolds as a tale of a former special agent assassin who, after going off the grid and starting a family, finds himself pursued by a relentless organization. The only option left is to go on the run with his entire family. Despite its straightforward plot with minimal twists and humor, the film has managed to earn a commendable 7.2 rating on IMDb, based on 71 audience reviews.Taking a closer look, the movie appears to draw inspiration from \"True Lies,\" a factor that might resonate with fans of Schwarzenegger's earlier works. However, beyond this familiarity, the film boasts commendable action sequences, and its overall narrative pace is expertly handled, preventing it from succumbing to dullness.The increasing inclusion of new Asian faces in Hollywood productions is a noteworthy trend. These aren't the stereotypical portrayals but refreshing talents like Li Meiqi and Daniel Wu. With the burgeoning influence of the film and entertainment culture from emerging Asian nations, particularly South Korea, Hollywood must address and dismantle its antiquated stereotypes, especially those depicting Asians with big faces and squinty eyes.In a nutshell, \"Family Plan\" stands as a worthwhile addition to the action movie genre. However, it's worth noting that the film crew might have exercised a bit too much frugality in their use of ketchup, metaphorically speaking. This nuanced observation adds an element of critique without overshadowing the overall positive appraisal of the movie.",

A couple of supporting performances by Ciarán Hinds and Maggie Q help to counteract Mark Wahlberg's awful lead and contribute to making this drivel barely watchable overall. I might try to share some of the unmemorable plot points, but I only like watching movies with memorable characters, and Ms. Monaghan and the character of her toddler are the only ones present here. Along with more plot holes than Swiss cheese. Did we need a full two, mind-numbing hours to include more pointless & bloodless stunt work? For the love of God, no, of course we didn't.

        "body":"6.7\/10 (recommend)After seeing the trailer I was excited for this film to release and I'll say the wait was worth it. There's nothing significantly special about the film, but it provides a family aspect while still giving entertaining action.The main draw for me was Mark Wahlberg. I'm always entertained by his stuff. He doesn't give a standout performance, but he hasn't lost his mojo yet. Michelle Monaghan, Zoe Colletti, and Van Crosby round out the family perfectly. I don't know them as actors very well, but their attributes are perfectly suited to their characters. My favourite character was baby Max. The infectious laughing and giggles reminded me of Jack Jack from \"The Incredibles\".The story is good and progresses well despite being a little long. It doesn't just focus on action and killing. It also brings the family issues to a front so bad guys are the only things being combatted. Trying to navigate different things while trying to keep everyone safe. The characters don't feel rigid. Everyone has an ability that adds to the survival.I enjoyed the looks and sounds of the film. The different environments and landscapes made it feel like you were part of the road trip. Sounds were a huge deal for this film to work. Lots of gunfire, punches, glass, and vehicles being fired, broken, or moving. The main take was punches and glass sounded natural either by landing properly with the visual, or not being bigger than what the object was. Glass bottle shattered like a glass bottle and a table the same thing. The music wasn't too shabby either. It all worked perfectly for the enjoyment of the film.Overall, this is an enjoyable family action flick though you don't have to watch it with your family. The downside is if swearing isn't your thing then maybe skip it. If you like Mark Wahlberg then he's worth the time. The movie does a good job to draw you into the family while also entertaining you with action and violence. Looks and sounds like a film of this calibre should look and sound like.That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",

It is not even unreasonable to say that in the final part of the film, this process continues again and the film finally turns into a work that may have been produced for such a purpose from the beginning. The movie does not have much to say in terms of story and its ending is completely predictable. The movie isn't meant to surprise us and even the characters aren't smart enough to be annoying.But the film seems to be made in such a way that its only purpose is to entertain the viewer for two hours. The movie is not going to offer a special and different experience and it doesn't even have a very lasting moment. But the point is that if we want to not be critical while watching the movie and simply watch the movie without being sensitive about any issue, the result can be satisfactory and the movie was actually produced with such a mentality.",

I took a day off and picked it back up and made it to the final third which had a bit more to chew on. I was on board at that point and things got at bit more fun and interesting, relatively speaking.I think the idea with this film was to try to repeat the success of Instant Family, which was a great film. The cliché is you never know until you try and in this case The Family Plan tried and came up a little bit short but I still liked it.There were some decent performances in this film, although not from Mark. I'm not sure what happened, but he seemed zoned out during this. Maybe he was busy managing the film and not focusing on his acting? A subjective thought, perhaps.Ultimately the film wraps things up nicely with some feel-good scenes.One major flaw I will point out is that the film seems to be leaning towards the family-friendly direction, but has various aspects that will not work for most families. Quite a shame, because the message is reasonably good and with just a tiny bit of editing this would have been a fun family night film for even younger teens. As-is, it's more older teen and adult.

The first 75% of the script aside from the obvious anachronisms could have easily been something written in the 1950s. The characters are devoid of the many histrionics that seem to have become a staple of modern movie's characters.I can't remember the last time I watched a family comedy where at least one of the main cast wasn't insufferable but here we actually have a healthy loving family for once! And that's not to say this family doesn't have problems. In fact the first half of the movie is dedicated to the family's problems and personal dramas but they work through them as normal mature people who have conflicting perspectives on the world rather than screaming at each other incessantly. While all of this is going on we have the time to get to know and care for each member of the family, so when the danger picks up in the second half we actually care about what's going on.This movie doesn't break any new ground, but again, what makes this movie good isn't that they add a bunch of new things, it's that for once many of the defects that seem to affect practically all modern family entertainment are absent, and for that I say bravo!Lastly I can't end this without mentioning how good all the cast was, with special mention for Michelle Monaghan navigating an unbelievable situation with a very believable performance.",

So in spite of some viewers complaining it's not the next great blockbuster, this film still delivers on entertainment.And while her part is VERY minor.. love me some Maggie Q.Minuscule adult oriented content (one, rather tame, scene), no nudity, very light on foul language. Violence is the greatest aspect - and due to the violence, I'd not suggest this for younger viewers. It's NOT a \"family film\" due to the violence.-----------------All that being posted.. and irrelevant to the actual storyline... it was VERY strange to see these optics from an Apple film... all these henchmen chasing down this white suburban family are black. Seriously, ALL the low-level street henchmen\/killer were black.. the race dynamics were so, so prevalent they were readily apparent to me. And honestly, that's rarely anything I would notice.",

Okay I admit I'm making a review only on the first 20-30 minutes cause then I had enough .And seriously this is not acting ,it's so theatrical the way they speak to eacother the parents . It's rare I quit a movie after 30 minutes, especially if it's with mark Wahlberg,cause I think he is awesome ,but everything about this movie and acting seems so fake and shallow. When they talk to each other it's not like a conversation ,it feels more like they are reading the lines while they try to act pff .Mark Wahlberg is a retired hitman working as a car salesman and all of a sudden hes cover is blown and while driving together with the family ,he is chased by these bad bad people ,it's so ridiculous and stupid and yes very very unrealistic like so many other movies I know ,but this is just idiotic and the acting portrayed in this seemingly serious deadly situation is just a laughing joke ,but your not laughing one bit .Mark Wahlberg get your act together and get back to SHOOTER VOL 2 character instead!!",

There is somewhat of a twist with a reveal about his past, with the father. But even so it didn't exactly elevate the film.The action is standard PG13 type we'd come to expect. The comedy isn't exactly funny but not overly forced. There is a great fight sequence with Michelle Monaghan and Maggie Q at the hotel.The kids were the weakest part and was too in our faces. The constant subplot with the son being a popular video game streamer and having to overcome his fear of real life scenarios or his relationship with Wahlberg. The daughter wasn't any better as she was the typical bratty teen. The baby felt slightly forced and was added in too many scenes.The near opening scene with the hitman attacking Wahlberg in the supermarket while he was holding the baby with customers watching felt entirely unrealistic.",

I will say the film looks just splendid, especially the scenes in Narnia, with beautiful snowy sets (some looked as though it had come from the LOTR trilogy). However, some of the scenes looked as though they had been computerised, such as the scene with the children and beavers running across the ice. There were also some attempts to put some humour into the story like the professor's line \"ah yes, the weeping one\" in reference to Lucy and the beavers especially, but because the director had taken liberties to make the story darker, the humour didn't quite work. However there are a number of positives, like the spirited performances of the children, Georgie Henley especially, better than Sophie Wilcox's rather goofy portrayal in the 1988 series. James McAvoy is charming as Mr. Tumnus, and Liam Neeson was majestic as Aslan. But the acting honours go to Tilda Swinton as the White Witch, even with her calmness she dominates the screen, in a sometimes chilling portrayal as the character. The film was fairly faithful to the book, but the added scenes and dialogue failed to engage as much. All, a flawed but enjoyable film. 7\/10 Bethany Cox",

Naturally it did not coincide 100% with my own vision of Narnia visually, but emotionally it rang absolutely true, choking me up several times and really touching me.

The stand-out performance was definitely Tilda Swinton's as the White Witch, but I liked all actors\/voices, from cute little Lucy (newcomer Georgie Henley) to majestic Aslan (Liam Neeson).

The Pevensie four children(Henley,Keynes,Moseley and Poppewell) are sent to live at the country house of eccentric teacher Kike(Jim Broadvent). Meantime they're playing hide and seek, Lucy encounters a strange wardrobe that lead the snowy land of Narnia . There, she finds a sympathetic but coward faun(James McAvoy). Later she returns at home and the others don't believe her at first, but soon are convinced. Then, all of them go throughout the fantastic world with fauns and centaurs and where animals speaking, a beaver( voice by Ray Winstone), fox(voice by Rupert Everett) and furthermore the Father Christmas(James Cosmo). This magic land with perpetual winter is ruled by the nasty White Witch(Tilda Swinton). But the children are the chosen ones, according an ancient prophecy, and they team up with Aslem, the mighty Lion and real king of Narnia , fighting to defeat the evil witch in an epic finale battle.The pic is a magic story with rip-snorting adventures, exciting fantasy, sensational scenarios and good feeling. Plenty of action and emotion and with an incredible battle scenes similar to ¨Lord of the Rings¨. Provide enough amusement to keep the chat rooms humming until the epic ending comes out. In spite of overlong runtime and the difficult of adapting, the film still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamiliar with the lengthy literary and highly detailed work by C. S. Lewis. This two and a half hour movie stays closer to the original work than any of the former efforts, mostly animated. The film displays a colorful and evocative cinematography by Donald McAlpine. Musical score fitting perfectly to the action-adventure by Harry Gregson-Williams. The motion picture is marvellously directed by Andrew Adamson, he's the director,producer, writer of ¨Shrek¨ trilogy. Rating : Above average and worthwhile seeing . It's a very likable adventure-fantasy and enormously appealing for kids, adolescents and all family.",

Lewis' first entry in his classic Narnia Series starts off awkwardly like a combination of the \"Wizard of Oz\" and \"Lord of the Rings.\" The filmmakers spend too much time early on trying to be cute and Disney-fy the product while clumsily presenting scenes composed of live-action actors and not-so-great computer effects. The result, not surprisingly is like an animated film with some flesh-and-blood actors spliced in. However, once you get used to the film stylistically, all is mostly forgiven.The filmmakers finally find solid ground when they really start to dig deeply into the story and reveal the blending of nature-based neo-paganism with medieval Christian mythology and wrap it up nicely into a children's fairytale. It's when you start to realize the white witch (played effectively by the always somewhat creepy Tilda Swinton) represents the old pre-Abraham polytheism demanding animal and human sacrifice for appeasing the pantheon of gods\/goddesses and the lion king, Aslan, represents the Christian view of one self-sacrificing god that you remember the brilliance of Lewis' source material. And while it isn't terribly well executed, the epic \"Battle-Beast\" style showdown at the end is pretty entertaining from a visual and imaginative standpoint.",

I came out stunned by the magnitude of the picture. Everything about it is so well done, the casting, the scenery, the score. Lord of the Rings is the only thing I can think of to compare it to. I experienced the same overwhelming sense of awe watching both of these phenomenal pictures. The CG images are very good, though not quite as startlingly realistic as those in LOTR. I cannot find fault with the casting in any way.Though the voice of Liam Neeson is not as I would have imagined a lion's at first, it is smooth, confident, and effective. Aslan is given the presence so essential to the heart of the story. I must comment on the performance of James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus, which I believe was the best in the film. Lucy was adorable, and surprisingly convincing, and Peter was given a very firm performance. I was a little nervous about how Edmund would turn out, but I needn't have worried; those large, startlingly dark eyes are perfect for the change from traitor to hero. I commend the directors of the movie on their strict adherence to the book. Narnia isn't just \"based\" on the book. It IS the book. The scope, depth, and wonder of Lewis's world have been captured in a timeless manner that should be cherished for all ages. This is a movie for everyone, at a level for children to understand, yet with a fast plot and exciting battle sequences that will keep anyone interested. The last battle scene especially is as touching as any I have ever seen, including those in LOTR, putting tears in my eyes even while my heart soared.

        "body":"A strangely disappointing experience given the quality credentials of just about all involved.The relative inexperience of the writers is clearly evident. Whether seen as a metaphor for a world without God (hell), or the Nazi regime, the cultural and social landscape of Narnia is ripe with potential, none of which is realized here. The White Witch's regime is not explored, we are not told who she is, where she came from, how or why she took over the world. She lacks any motivation or real emotional drive. Similarly, the children seem happy to throw themselves into a war without a second thought of home. Nothing in this story is ever explained, we are simply expected to accept it without question, which is a far more dictatorial representation of Christianity than Lewis ever intended. The plotting lacks energy and momentum, with no real sense of suspense. The characterization is weak and one-dimensional. But even more surprisingly from the creators of Shrek, is the complete lack of humor.The acting is sound from all but the leads. The two older children struggle to bring the necessary range of emotion to their roles, with Moseley in particular presenting a decidedly weak interpretation of heroic kingliness. The two younger children luckily make up for their on screen siblings' shortcomings, with Henley bringing the wide-eyed innocence to Lucy that the role requires, and Keynes displaying a surprising amount of subtlety as the eternally wronged and resentful Edmund. McAvoy and Swinton are both excellent and at times are required to carry the movie alone.The CGI is competent, but little more. It's always good to see Fauns and Centaurs running around, but it doesn't break any boundaries in terms of design or execution. There's none of the thrill of the vast armies of Middle Earth, or the attention to the minutiae of Narnia that is really necessary in realizing a new world from scratch.Disney clearly hopes that this will bring them the rewards that 'Lord of the Rings' brought New Line Cinema and 'Harry Potter' is bringing to Warner Brothers. But 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' lacks the emotional depth, epic range, creative inventiveness and dramatic urgency of the 'Rings' trilogy. Similarly, it has none of the humor, camaraderie, charisma or charm of 'Harry Potter'. Judging from the audience that I saw it with, it will be very popular, and a sequel is very probable, but unless Narnia finds some heart and soul, the complete cycle seems unlikely.",

The stories are rich in mythology and religious symbolism, drawing upon archetypes from the Norse, Greco-Roman, Persian, medieval chivalric, and Judeo-Christian traditions.Now comes this wonderful film of the first chronicle, \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.\" The beautiful cinematography and the terrific performances of the children make this film outstanding for family viewing. As integrated with the live actors, the colorful animal characters, especially the Lion (Jesus), reveal brilliant technical film-making as well.Lewis's books are not overtly allegorical. Rather, the symbols and the messages are subtle. The four children in the story (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) were inspired by the actual children evacuated from London during World War II, who spent time in Lewis's home. Lewis wanted his books to be enjoyed by young people who would later in their lives draw the spiritual meanings from the stories.

I loved the books as a child, and most specifically \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,\" which I read numerous times when I was young...but no matter how faithful the adaptation is - story-wise - some elements don't fit into place.I think it's one of those books that is better off left as a book. The themes and actions that take place in C.S. Lewis' Christian allegory do not translate well to the screen. I felt that something was off. The direction by Andrew Adamson (\"Shrek\") is commendable, but the second half of the movie is very bright, the animation throughout is quite poor (except for Aslan), and the final battle comes across as utterly silly.Also, by squeezing the book into a two-hour movie whilst still retaining the essence of the novel, Adamson's film lacks cohesion. It all happens too fast. The characters are rather thin and I felt as if some scenes were handled poorly. For example, when Edmund first meets the White Witch -- if you were a young child who had just stumbled into a world inside a wardrobe, then told by a queen you were going to be the king, don't you think it'd be hard to conceal your excitement? Instead, Edmund returns into the real world, and the only hint we get that he's thinking about Narnia is when a very poor exposition scene occurs with Peter pointing out how Edmund is sulking about.The course of action in the film is poorly developed as well. One minute they're reluctant to fight, the next minute they're armored up. The problem is that with a two-hour film like this, it's hard to develop the characters. In a novel, it's easier - the general narratives of novels make us feel more attached to the characters. WATCHING them is much different - and it's hard to take their decision to join Narnia's battle against the White Witch very seriously at all.Also, maybe I was the only one who noticed that young Georgie Henley (who plays Lucy) was always smiling. Not just a happy smile, though. A wicked smile, like she's just played a trick on somebody and ready to savor the revenge. It's kind of creepy. When she cries at the end, it still looked like she was ready to stab someone in the back and break into a maniacal laugh.Am I being harsh? Probably a bit too much, yes. It's just that coming from a child-at-heart who loved this particular book years ago, I feel the adaptation as a whole is simply mediocre. I felt disattached from the characters, I thought the animation was poor, some scenes were handled poorly, and the final battle was a joke.Overall, it's worth seeing if you like the book(s). I was personally disappointed by the film, but it seems - judging from its IMDb rating - most people weren't.Hopefully the sequel will be better.",

Recently it seems to be en vogue to have children or teenagers playing the leads in fantasy movies (ala Frodo and Harry Potter), but what Narnia failed to do is make these children believable.There was no transition from these kids' innocence and ignorance into courageous warriors and saviors. In Lord of the Rings, Frodo and Sam were never sure of themselves and they constantly exhibited inexperience throughout their goal to save middle earth. Harry Potter was always in need of help and he was not even the best magician in his class. But in the prophecy rich Narnia in which four humans were foretold to save the land, it seems all of the prognostication forced itself upon the somewhat unwilling heroes. First the siblings are bumbling around Narnia trying to stay alive as anyone would do in a foreign land, and then seemingly overnight the older brother is leading a major battle, the other brother is an integral part of that battle, while the two girls develop fearlessness of the foreign woods they are in.The movie lacked intensity, there were never any white knuckle moments or hair raising events. The dialog was very generic and far from profound though one can infer that it was supposed to be, and the drama was mild even with the fate of an entire mythical land being in the hands of children.

My earliest recall of the story was an animated cartoon, where 4 children chanced upon a wardrobe which transported them to a medieval-fantasy ice world ruled by an evil witch.The introductory scene might confuse audiences that their watching Band of Brothers, though the German blitz over London is a sight to behold. Father Pevensie has gone off to fight in the war, and Mother Pevensie decided to pack the 4 Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, to the countryside to seek safe havens. They get to live with Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent in an extremely underutilized role), and the youngest of them all, Lucy, discovers the Wardrobe in one of the mansion's rooms.The children bicker a lot, and through their Narnia adventures, learn about the importance of family and cooperation. Disbelieving Lucy at first, the rest got introduced to the wardrobe soon enough, and thus begin their stay in Narnia only after an hour into the movie (Yes, it takes that long before something decent happens on screen). Put under an icy curse, Narnia awaits the arrival of 2 sons of Adam and 2 daughters of Eve to deliver it from the clutches of the evil White Witch (Tilda Swindon, perhaps the only human form in Narnia).But first, the children have to learn to make sense of the gifts bestowed upon them by Father Christmas, as well as to seek out Aslan, the mystical (speaking) lion, voiced by the regal Liam Neeson, in yet another mentor-like role after this years Kingdom of Heaven and Batman Begins. Yes, he's a good choice, but used too often it becomes deja-vu.The talking animals became the talk of the town amongst some critical circles, but I say, give it a break. There are talking lions, beavers, wolves, foxes, etc, whose lips move in sync with their impeccable English, that I'm sure will sell many merchandise, probably soft toys.While the cinematography is beautiful, somehow, familiarity with the source material brought about a monotone feel to the narrative. You'd know what will happen next, and the way this movie is delivered, there isn't much of a crescendo or scenes to excite. Shrek director Andrew Adamson should have known better, but opted for the safe and boring route.The acting by the animals surpassed their human counterparts. The four Pevensie children are excruciating painful to watch. Their acting's very contrived and forced, and I wonder if there could be other worthy contenders amongst those who auditioned. The pixel-creations of the animators gave the animals more range than the 4 kids. Tilda Swindon looked evil throughout, but that's about it. Somehow her androgynous role as Gabriel in Constantine was way better than her role here as the resident witch.The highlight is probably the much talked about, effects laden war scene, but from scenes in the trailer, there isn't much else to add. Already spoilt by mega war scenes from the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Chronicles doesn't go one up against what audiences already experienced, safe to substitute Uruk-hais and various Orcs with animals and mythical creatures like the centaurs. Lacking intensity throughout the battle, I was taking stock of which animal was on whose side, like the polar bears and white tigers on the side of the White Witch, and the mass of centaurs on Aslan's.Don't get me started on the religiousness and the classification that this film is \"Passion of the Christ\" for kids. If you subscribe to that, you'll believe anything. I think one must have read too much into the major sacrificial and resurrection scene. There is hardly any blood spilt, nor is there any major bloody torture scene to rival Mel Gibson's picture. Just because this scene is similar to Christ's resurrection, or the theme of the coming of the messiah(s), or the betrayal scene makes one label this movie as such, is stretching it a bit too far. It's a children's movie\/story, for crying out loud, so just leave it as such.Will this movie make money? Sure, on the fact that it's an event movie. Chronicles of Narnia built its hype, but didn't offer anything new in terms of special effects, and was weighted down by mediocre acting and a plain, bland narrative. Should there be another movie based on the books, let's hope it betters the first one.",

However, it was disappointing besides the visual eye candy.Human characters particularly weak besides Swinton, I was rooting for the white witch the entire time. The kids themselves are irritating, lame, and whiny, besides maybe the smallest of the four. They're relatively one dimensional.There's several points in the story in which believability is thrown out the window, given that it is a \"children's fantasy,\" in which I'll allow some sort of leeway, but there HAS to be some sort of rational sequence of events that leads up to the acquiring a certain skill or a turn of events.Strategy and stupidity of the armies is enormous, I refuse to believe that a white witch who has ruled over the world for the past 100 years is that bad of a tactician.All in all, the CG animals, such as the talking beavers are the redeeming aspect the adaptation.Probably entertaining for someone not as critical or for little kids.",

Some people don't know that the Chronicles of Narnia is allegorical and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was based off the crucifixion. this only makes the story more realistic and fascinating as the Director (Andrew Adamson) takes C.S. Lewis's incredible world and adapts it to screen for all the world to see. the story focuses on four children who find their way into a magical world called Narnia where animals talk and thins like unicorns and nymphs and mermaids are real. it sounds simplistic but there is another twist to this world. eternal winter seems consume what was once a beautiful country. this winter is because of a witch (Tilda Swinton) who has Narnia under her rain. but when the Pevensies, Peter (William Mosely), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley) come to this world, they discover the truth about a lion called Aslan (Liam Neeson) who is the real King of Narnia. one might expect a silly story about kids who talk to animals and fairies and learn lessons and stuff like that, but the story is so much more intricate and spectacular. more than just a 'good story'. it's a one of a kind adventure.

I've actually never read any of the books except for The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, so I was looking forward to seeing the film. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed.The story itself was well-told, and it remained true to C.S. Lewis' writings. Unfortunately, the child-actors were a bit on the weak side and didn't really add to the drama and epic nature of the film. Also, the CGI work was very disappointing- I expected much more from such a high-budget movie. You could most definitely tell this movie was directed by the same guy who did Shrek, a lot of the animals and larger scenes of the encampment looked fake and cheap. Everyone seems to be up in arms over the religious overtones\/undertones (however you like to perceive it). I myself being a Christian didn't go to the movie looking for it, I just wanted to enjoy a good movie. However, the allegories are pretty hard to miss for any educated adult who has knowledge of Christianity. And yes, some pastor's have used that too their advantage, and rightly so - that's their job. But in all honesty, if you were looking for a strong film to formulate a message from, I'd go with something that had a better quality to it. The movie is indeed a fun film, full of adventure and wonder. Not quite on the epic level of Lord of the Rings, so don't get your hopes up. For kids and teens, I think its an excellent movie that might inspire some kids to pick up the book when they get home. It's a good thing too, because I think the book captures the imagination much more than the movie did.",

        "body":"Adapting a book that so many audience members have read and cherish is surely a daunting task, but I believe it is also a great responsibility. Recently, Peter Jackson set the bar pretty high in this regard with the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. Unfortunately, Adamson's \"Narnia\" wasn't quite up to snuff.I count myself among those who cherish \"The Chronicles of Narnia,\" having read them as a child and having re-read \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" in eager anticipation of the film. In my opinion, this film adaptation not only falls short, but does a disservice to the audience by cheating us of much of the impact and wonder of the original books.Here are the general categories (including some specific examples) where I felt the film didn't deliver:Screen Adaptation - Some important scenes that illustrated character dynamic were cut short making later behavior and motivation seem exaggerated or cliché. Example: The scene where Edmund meets Jadis was rushed and awkward. (It wasn't even demonstrated that the Turkish Delight was enchanted in order to manipulate Edmund - we were left to assume that his allegiance to Jadis was due solely to avarice!) Also, in the book, the mere mention of the name \"Aslan\" for the first time was an event that had an important impact on the children. In the movie this impact was all but lost, as these subtler points were sacrificed to save screen time for the type of gruesome battle scenes that you would expect from a \"fantasy\" movie but in this case didn't serve to advance the story. Another pulled punch: in the book, the scene with Father Christmas was a brilliant omen of the turning of the tides but here the scene seemed out of place and just downright weird. (They might as well have run into the Easter Bunny.)A couple of outright inventions served only to distract us from the magic and mystery of the real story: The waterfall scene - who came up with that idea? The cricket ball through the window - not as effective as the original story.Casting - The elder siblings were mediocre, and I can't tell if Tilda Swinton was just awfully directed or totally miscast. (In the book Jadis was a noble and grand enchantress, albeit with dastardly aims; in the movie she was shallow, petty and despicable.) Oh, and Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan the Lion was not nearly powerful enough--this is one of the most important roles in the film. Was James Earl Jones not available?Direction of Actors' Performances - This ties in with my comments about casting, above. Performances in individual scenes seemed disjointed from overall character motivations and some character interpretations (such as Jadis and Edmund) were shallow and unsympathetic. Where was the charisma that would have made Jadis's character believable, let alone have enabled her to amass an army of supporters? Hair\/Make-up - Jadis sports blonde distractingly annoying dreadlocks despite her otherwise un-Irie nature. The professor's hair and beard looked about as realistic as a department store Santa, and the main Centaur's make-up also stood out as distractingly awful.Wardrobe - Jadis has one outfit in particular that looks like it came right off the runway of a bad 80's fashion show. Another includes an atrocious hat shaped like a giant icicle--Mr. Freeze from Batman & Robin would have had hearts in his eyes.Special Effects - Overall special effects were not nearly as cleanly integrated as WETA's work on LOTR, and cohesion was lacking. For example, the cuts between live action and CGI wolves were painful at best. Also, the teeming masses of bad-guys all looked as though they could have been extras in the Orc armies of LOTR. Mr. Tumnus was an example of the fact that Jadis's supporters were comprised of otherwise beneficent creatures that she'd charmed, threatened and bullied into joining her. Here they were unimaginatively portrayed as one-dimensional twisted, evil fiends.Cinematography - Boring; All the visual texture and lighting of a made-for-TV movie. Due to my disappointment in Adamson's interpretation of this work, and in the execution of the movie that resulted, I rate this film a 5 out of 10. It is not completely devoid of entertainment value but fails to uphold the responsibility that a filmmaker shoulders when adapting so well-known and well-loved a story.",

        "body":"One of the most anticipated films of the year is the adaption of the beloved book by C.S. Lewis \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\". With a cinema filled of families and people of all ages (there were more adults than kids), I was very excited about enjoying a film that I had waited impatiently for weeks to see. Just to get the negatives out of the way, Narnia is a bit slow. The first 40 minutes crawl by at a snails pace and the lead up to the meeting of Mr. Tumnus and Lucy is dragged out too much. But when all four kids get through the wardrobe, the story really gets to picked up by likable characters (the beavers come to mind) and tense scenes with the White Witch.As for the positive notes, the scenery was top notch, with many people in the audience audibly playing \"Where in the country was this scene filmed?\" The animation and special effects are brilliant as well. Most notably, Aslan, the lion saviour, is wonderfully animated and incredibly realistic. At times, you could just as well be looking at a real lion. Other effects of centaurs, fauns, griffins, beavers, and bull-headed monsters are also top notch.On an entirely different note, I really don't understand what all the fuss is about with the religious allegory. The symbolism is there for all to see including all the elements of sacrifice, and forgiveness, but it's not \"in your face\" or distracts you from the rest of the story. If you enter the cinema seeking an allegory on Somebody's sacrifice, you'll be content with what you see. And if you plan seeing this film just as a family friendly holiday movie, you'll be content too.In all, Narnia deserves a worthy 7\/10. It may be a bit slow out of the gate and outstay it's welcome length, but it's a worthy family film that enchants both young and old and transports you effectively into the land of Narnia.",

The emotional depictions were worse. The screenplay wasn't great either. The scenery, the special effects, however - with the exception of most of the animals' talking - were good. I began to hope that the appearance of Aslan would save the film, but he was a disappointment as well. The majestic King seems like a big stuffed toy from FAO Swartz.The whole thing comes off as childish. I often thought that it would be OK to pass this movie off on a kid, but not an adult. Even the classic lines at the end, \"After all, Aslan is not a tame lion \/ But he is good\" simply had no power whatsoever.In the inevitable comparison to the amazing Lord of the Rings trilogy, there simply is no contest. That's a shame, because the Lewis writings are truly superb and deserve far better treatment. Now that this version is done, it will serve as a firewall preventing a better interpretation from being done for a long time.As I said, I wanted to like the movie. Not only do I enjoy the richness of the original story, I love its Christian underpinnings as well. I remember years ago being genuinely moved by a simple animated version of this story, especially the scene of the death of Aslan, where there was a holy silence that descended not only on the land of Narnia but on my own heart as well; but this expensive production barely stirred me. It may well be that Disney is simply out of its depth with this kind of rendering, that its massive corporate group-think actually works against producing an artistic work of this kind when using real actors rather than pictures.That's sad, for what could have been but is not.",

        "body":"While I definitely would have liked a more mature version of this film than it was, it was Disney and I can let that part go. What I can't let go is how terrible the special effects were done. #1 Blue\/Green Screening This is 2005, there is NO reason for half assed blue screen effects. There were several scenes where the children were standing in front of a pictureeque mountain top view and it was so obvious it was a blue\/green screen that it completely ruined any emotion they were trying to get across. #2 Proportions This is a film which has many characters with differing sizes: Giants, Minitaurs, Centaurs, Dwarfs, etc. It's clearly important that they look proper when they're in the same scene together and not like some cheap photoshop editing. Unfortunately the latter is what you get. There are loads of scenes where I have no idea what they were thinking. I mean, I understand digital animation isn't cheap, but if you're going to rely so heavily on it you should be prepared to do it well (Peter Jackson, LOTR well).#3 Limitations in digital animation One of the most difficult forms to emulate with digital animation is hair and\/or fur. Short or curly is sigificantly easier to render than long (2+ inches), flowy hair. This is because each hair has to be independent of the others and animated in a similar fashion, but not exactly the same. Unfortunately there were several major characters in this film whom were created digitally and had long, flowy hair. The result is they looked poorly animated, digital characters. It's a shame that Disney, a company who once owned the animation market is no trailing so far behind. I had such high hopes for this film and the ones to follow. Unfortunately, I don't think they'll ever be realized.",

For one thing the child actors actually look like people, not like surgically enhanced dolls (the actor of Peter actually really much resembles Englands Prince William...) - and they play pleasantly subtle. The decor of the world Narnia is not too fanciful and the lighting looks mostly natural. The CGI's are amazing: all the talking, running, flying animals - and especially the great lion Aslan - actually seem to have some weight at last. If it wasn't for the grand epic score that all too much resembles the \"Lord of the Rings\"- Trilogy, this would be a likable enough. But the score is over-persuasive all through the film. It doesn't allow you a second to take a breath, think for yourself and makes you feel strained out after the first half hour or so. A contradiction in itself: how the images work so hard on creating a whole different universe. And the soundtrack\/score at the same time works so hard on making it sound like any other blockbuster of the season ...",

The land of Narnia is beautifully brought to life, and the art direction, props, creatures, costumes, are all equally spectacular. It is a very broad and epic movie, with all sorts of different creatures and monsters for the audience to stare in fascination at. So visually, well done, I have very few complaints. But the story, the actual film as a whole felt lacking to me. As I said I have read the books, and I was impressed that very little was changed at all, in fact I had a hard time remembering anything. Nearly everything important was preserved from the book, with little to no alteration. Yet in the end, I didn't feel the story, it didn't emotionally move me. The acting was good, yet flat and predictable much of the time. In fact because so much of the story was preserved, I felt like it was just a copy of the books. And while that is good, especially to 'purists' of the book, film is a different medium from literature, and thus the style has to change somewhat in order to evoke what the books do. But I don't hate the film, I thought it was quite good, I loved the books, and I like this film as well. It just didn't have the depth and emotional truth of the books.

The biggest problem related to this were that the LORD OF THE RING movies were so great, so grand and so wonderful that this left this film in the category of \"also ran\".

But as someone who first heard this tale as a bedtime story when I was 3 or 4 years old and having read the book now numerous times, I have to say I was disappointed. I know I can't expect perfection or a word to word exact translation from book to film but the movie seemed to alter the personality of the book just enough for me to feel let down. It was as if they took the body of the book striped it down to it's bare bones and then fitted it with a new body. So much of the charm of the book is in the humor and wit of its author which I didn't see or feel in the movie at all. The rhythm felt all off to me. I don't understand why they added some stuff that didn't enhance the story any (in my opinion) and didn't make it any shorter, and took out important dialogue that gave much more depth to the different characters. There were scenes I thought were done very well and if I had never read the book I'm sure I would think it a great and entertaining movie. But I have read the book, backwards and forwards, and to a hard core fan like me this movie did not cut it. I am sorry to be such a downer in the midst of all this praise, and I think those involved in the film should feel proud - it is a good movie - I just can't help but feel it could of been more. But maybe a movie maker has more to consider than keeping us hard core book fans happy and also need to think of those who have never read the book at all. And I will always have the book - just the way it is, and I can always use my imagination to go to the Narnia I have gone to as a child. I hope I never lose that magic and never grow to old and lose the power of my imagination - I don't believe C.S. Lewis ever did.",

Unfortunately, what is gained by the spectacular imagery is lost by the screenplay. Though the film occasionally falls victim to the hyperbolic theatrics that Hollywood so loves, the most disappointing factor is the failure of the adaptation to integrate fluidly Lewis' theology. C.S. Lewis' greatest accomplishment in the book series is his adroit and nuanced amalgamation of theology into the story. In the film, it seems like a secular story with Christian theology awkwardly (and overtly) wedged in between plot points. Standing alone, the imagery is magnificent, and the story is engaging; compared to the book, the film adds nothing and takes quite a bit.",

All those cute animals communicating in English and those joyful enthusiastic children trying to help everyone they either have, or haven't met. Yep, they really did it this time. Or have they....I couldn't stop myself from catching the fact that the film was dull. I mean, they really stayed faithful to the original, which can be as far as I'm concerned, only a good thing, but the result was vastly disappointing. Maybe it was just a bad mood, or too high expectations, but still:\"Boooooooooooring\"! However I must give credits to Tilda Swinton for her performance in acting the Snow witch. Her deeds were as cruel and as hysterical as I remember them from cartoon. As the snow laied throughout the Narnia was melting, so was she getting more and more repulsive. Her attractive blistering pale skin from beginning was steadily turning into a red burned dermal cancer.\"And I would have gotten away with it, if it wasn't for you meddling kids.\" Don't we all remember that line from Scooby Dooby Doo. Why did those pesky children had to interfere. Who is to say that wood animals are better in views of good versus evil, than mountain goblins, minotaurs and other black marked animals. The way I see it, all they did was playing a role of a revolutionary, stepping on a side of anarchy. Fairy-tales can get disturbing sometimes. What I resent them the most is that if they wanted to film a movie for children, why did they have to make it so violent. I get the filling like they wanted to make an universal film, for anybody to watch. If they really wanted that, why filming a fairy-tale??",

        "body":"Narnia isn't the next Lord of the Rings, nor the next Harry Potter, at least on the cinema screen. Even what spirit those fantasy spectacles had, Narnia lacks. And it seems the whole hundreds-plus audience, many of whom were children, agreed with me in their numb, passive state. No yelps of joy, excitement nor even the slightest scare. After the movie ended, both kids and adults were in such a rush to leave, silent and obviously underwhelmed, that some of them missed the tacked-in ending during the credits.Visually, the movie is a quality work, displaying technical prowess and craftsmanship. You will wonder how they managed to create all beasts from the real world to the mythology, from beavers, panthers and lions to fauns, centaurs and gryphons. There are also some large, captivating sights such as the view of the ice castle and the scene of the final battle. The snow is dubious though, but I guess that is acceptable.What is not acceptable is the soullessness and joylessness of the rest of actual content of the film. Much of it weighs down upon the main roles the main roles. Georgie Henley's Lucy Pevensie gets a lot of screen time compared to her siblings, which is for the better thanks to her charisma. The rest of three, however, come off as stiff and unnatural, with perhaps more fault to the script and directing than the actors themselves. The children are portrayed as precocious on some occasions, yet unbelievably daft on others. Due to this, the three eldest siblings are thrown quite off balance during the film, and not in the credible way of children, but rather for the goal-oriented purposes of trying to build up suspense and plot where there is none.Maybe the producers have tried to make a child-centered movie by explaining the obvious, but it feels more like underestimating its young viewers. On the other hand, the deeper questions are left completely unattended, such as the nature of the Great Magic, and the importance of Humans. This leaves the story empty, and creates a soft of befuddlement over the whole movie: what was all the fighting about? Why were the good creatures good and the bad creatures not? Underneath its eye candy, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is hollow, and without a soul, the exterior fails to impress alone.",

        "body":"Writing about big movies like this is a real pleasure because you can assume that the reader has already been exposed to the mainstream opinions and obvious controversies. So one can focus on other, perhaps more interesting issues.I was never a fan of Lewis' romantic Christianity and his allegorical crusade, not with the genius of \"Alice in Wonderland\" as the benchmark. Or the King Arthur stories. But I have to admit that while I found his written tale dull as Oxford dust, his storytelling ability had magic, and that was what made the thing fun for many. That business about the narrator being explicit and commenting on what is happening is lost in the two movies.Oh, I should say that you really should see the 88 BBC version first. It was both cheaper and more magical. It had much better kids except for the young girl. Neither production gave us an awareness of the powers of the Queen (except via wand), so that power had to be carried by intensity. Therefore, the screaming queen of 1988 fit better into the dynamics of the world.If you do see the 1988 version, it will remind you how artless this modern one is. I'd say about a quarter of the shots in this new one are almost perfect copies from the older. Look at really great productions; \"Aliens\" comes to mind, and you will note that there is not a single interesting design in this whole thing. Every shot, every character (mostly dumb rubber masks in queen associates) every character action is from the third bin down in familiarity. That is, except Tilda.Magic should be in the way the thing is portrayed. Nothing here seems magical at all, nothing like \"Time Bandits\" for instance, or a few of the better parts of \"Lord or the Rings.\" The sets were dull, the magical places ordinary.I am an admirer of Tilda. I'll see anything she is in and expect to enjoy it. She did have a captivating sequence here in the final battle, but it was ruined in a way by the dreadfully staged \"stone table\" sequence before. Straight out of a 40s cannibal movie, with a set so cheesy and artless it made me squirm. No Baz Luhrman here.Here's the thing. Tilda knows a whole lot more about what works and what doesn't than the director. So she's created her own character in his vacuum, her own wardrobe and makeup. Some of that is great, but it doesn't fit anything, not the book, and not the lumpy director's vision, or what it seems to be.So what you end up with that's positive, is an appealing young girl, an amazing witch in the battle scene, and one extremely nice cinematic effect. It was so good it made everything else seem cinematically unimaginative. This was when Lucy pulled the sheet off the wardrobe to reveal the tree carving (Alice again!). The dramatic movement of that drape was wonderful, just wonderful. It was featured in the trailer. Then you got Lucy's gaze for the first time, one that is repeated tiresomely thereafter.That this wonderful bit of magic came and went before Narnia appears made me look in vain for more.(There's another scene that could have been great. While Lucy is being hypnotized, virtual satyrs dance in the fireplace, a sort of dream within the vision within the movie. Another director might have implied what Lewis does, that everything that follows could be Lucy's Dream.)Oh, there's one overt decision the director made. A sad one. He decided to play up the Nazi angle. So we have that incongruous bombing sequence where the Germans look like monsters. This gave Tilda her cue to have an Aryan look and movieland Nazi coldness.What follows is an intrusion of the American battle narrative on the original British one: war is depicted as inherently vile at the beginning up until Santa Claus becomes an arms merchant. Thereafter it is depicted as glorious, with the girls now involved as warriors. The shift is that Christians are battling evildoers, you see.

        "body":"Despite some fine scenes and special effects here and there, \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" doesn't quite scale the heights of film fantasy to which it aspires. There's a kind of dramatic flatness to the story, at least as adapted here.Granted, the original isn't particularly complex emotionally even compared to Lord of the Rings. Director Andrew Adamson has only directed the animated \"Shrek\" films before this, so that could also be a reason for the one-dimensional quality of the drama.Also, the acting is very uneven. Among the children, the wonderful Georgie Henley as Lucy and Skandar Keynes as Edmund are fine, but Anna Popplewell is a dull Susan, and William Moseley is a stiff Peter whose transformation into a soldier is impossible to take seriously on any level. Tilda Swinton has a imperious coldness as the White Witch - I liked her though you could say that she isn't quite terrifying enough. Another highlight is James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus - his scenes with Lucy are among the best in the film.The final battle scene - not explicitly described in the novel - is Lord of the Rings Lite, but it works well enough. One disappointment is the voice of Liam Neeson as the lion Aslan. Obviously it was recorded separately, but Neeson's line readings aren't very engaging and the sound has a disembodied quality that exposes the artificiality of the special effects. Some of the other voice performers (Ray Winstone and Dawn French as the beavers, and Rupert Everett as the fox) fare better. This film gets its job done well enough, but classic fantasy film it isn't.It'll be interesting to see when\/if the rest of the Narnia books get adapted. Unlike \"Lord of the Rings\" or the more recent \"His Dark Materials\" trilogy, the remaining Narnia books are extremely variable in quality (and increasingly preachy), the final volume being downright dull.",

I actually applauded at the end, even though I was alone. \"Narnia\" can take its place as perhaps second to \"Lord of the Rings\" in the fantasy adaptations trophy room.I hadn't heard of any of the children in this movie, but they were all good. Expect that main little girl to get more work in the future, she was excellent. Tilda Swinton was so-so as the villain, but she wasn't very scary. The wicked witch in \"Wizard of Oz\" is more gangster than her.There were a few distractions while watching the movie. For one, there are more talking animals than a Disney animated film (wait, this is a Disney movie)! And it bugged me that I couldn't figure out who voiced the Lion. I thought for sure it was Sam Neill, but instead it was that Cadillac among Buicks, Liam Neeson who provided the vocal chops.All in all, \"Narnia\" is a very regal movie: exciting, good lessons for children, and spectacular visual effects.

I think that it is a movie that moviegoers of any age can enjoy, even if not in a 'very' sense. I was pleased with the film because I thought it was well paced, well filmed and that storytelling was crazy fun. Not only that but other pleasing things as well are the movie's humor, the comical touch to it, the innocent wonder and the main characters' play on words. The voice of Liam Neeson as the lion Aslan is compelling and worth a WAOUW exclamation. The voice fits the lion character perfectly. Lucy and Edmund are also compelling children characters and extremely believable. I even liked the evil White Witch whom I thought was a fabulous villain - just by her looks and calm presence you can instantly feel uneasy and feel hatred too. Well done on that, really. Oh, and last but not least is the direct visual imagery switch which I found really good and groundbreaking. Now, I'm going to say something else which I think the movie should have improved upon: I think that the wonderfully CGI designed Aslan lacks an outside character feel, which means that he should have been made into a character from or for (do you say for or from for that sentence?) whom you can feel respect and\/or fear in all of his scenes in a powerfully irresistible way. That I think would have made him a better character. My rating: 7.0\/10",

If you are familiar with the story, then there are no real surprises, but makes up for it with incredible CGI animation.",

        "body":"Let me admit that I was wary about this movie at first. The trailers (to me)looked really really dumb, and I was afraid that this movie would be a huge flop and nobody would ever read the books again. I love the books. I loved them when I was a child, and after reading them again, I loved them even more. I wouldn't be able to bear seeing Lewis's books turned into a bunch of cheesy films that only featured too-high-tech computer graphics and dumb child actors that screamed a lot. Lucky for me, this movie was just the opposite of a disaster. Andrew Adamson does a GREAT job with the graphics, I must say, as that's what he does do best. But he doesn't make it ALL special effects, he adds warmth and love to this movie, he adds depth and feeling. By the end of the movie, you're nearly crying because you don't want the film to end. The child actors that play the four pevensie children are fantastic, Adamson couldn't have picked a better group of kids. Leading them is Georgie Henley, who plays Lucy. She's absolutely great, she lights up the screen, she has amazing talent as an actress, and she's so young! That's the best part, really. Skandar Keynes plays Edmund, and he's so evil and bratty at first, it's rather scary. Later on, however, he changes very much, and you can't help but like him. Anna Popplewell and William Moseley are great as the two older siblings; Popplewell is bookish and annoying enough, and yet Queenly and beautiful, so that she pulls out a perfect Susan, and Moseley is awesome as Peter. He makes you think, \"Heck, I want this guy to be MY older brother,\" and that's perfect, it's just what is needed.There's so much more that's majestic and wonderful about this movie, that I could go on for hours, but I'll only end by saying this; you miss out on something beautiful and heart-warming if you neglect seeing this film.",

I loved the music and the imagery that was used to bring this beloved classic to the big screen. Obviously, the director is a faithful fan of Lewis and kept the movie as close to the book as was possible. I'm really looking forward to the sequel and I hope that many others agree. All of the characters were played beautifully and I wasn't disappointed by a single one. Peter is the strong, yet still maturing, future King of Narnia. Lucy is the innocent, little girl whose curiosity leads her siblings into a great adventure. Aslan is the majestic, powerful ruler of Narnia whose guidance and love is essential to the children's journey. Overall, the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is certainly one of Disney and 2005's best movies.",

The battle scenes would have been impressive to people seeing the film at the time of C.S.Lewis's writing in 1950 but not today ... sorry guys!In fact we wondered where the $180 million budget had gone !

I guess), the long distance build up for the re-introduction of Optimus Primal that are too long making it his appearance can be said not too much in the movie, and the exact problem from previous movies happening again, which is when they make Optimus Prime takes too much L, the way they make Optimus so weak neither in the beginning or in the middle while they always hailed him as the most powerful one and the legend and the leader of all Autobots kinda of pissed me off, that's basically most of my problem with the movie, while the goods of Rise Of The Beasts is of course the action, the battle scene are pretty exciting and the last battle was great, Anthony Ramos ok performance and characters itself overall is a W, all of the Autobots and the Maximals team were fine, Optimus got a lot of screen time, Noah's little brother and friend performance was fine, some cool and even funny scene, liked some of the soundtrack, and Scourge was a good villain, overall Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts is problematic and have a lot of flaws but it also still fills with entertaining action, villain, ok performance male lead, and not ridiculous main plot, it's not terrible but it's not amazing or incredible either, (the half plus score i gave for the movie is because Rise Of The Beasts have more stuff in it than the Bumblebee movie and that's why i am not giving it the same score which is only a 6 for Bumblebee).",

It is unfortunately a rather drab affair.Within about 5 minutes every cliche possible is ticked off the list. The dialogue is grating and so corny it hurts. The action is messy and disorienting. The newly introduced 'Maximals' are severely wasted with limited screen time. The plot centres around a silly doohickey that is hard to care about. The human characters are kind of annoying and poorly written. None of the humour really lands and neither do any of the emotional story beats. The story sags a little in the middle. I could go on.Saying all that, this film is mildly entertaining and does have its moments, although they are too few and far between. I guess it's worth watching if you are into your Transformers films, but the casual movie goer should probably save their money and skip this one.",

But I am ecstatic after watching the best Transformers movie since Dark of the Moon.I found myself smiling for most of the runtime. For the first time in years, I kept thinking \"Transformers are so damn cool.\" There are so many beautiful shots with these CGI creations, so many moments to screenshot and frame. The action is miles better than the last three entries.They fixed so many of the issues that plagued the last three movies. There are actual characters with motivations we understand, conflicts where we can see both sides of the argument. Even the Transformer characters are significantly more fleshed out. I felt for them.There is an actual story instead of nonsense to move the plot forward. You don't even have to turn your brain off to enjoy it. And the comedy actually works! I laughed more times than the previous three movies combined.This experience made me so happy, and I look forward to any future projects if this is the direction they're taking. It's a perfect example of how, if you do it right and create with care and passion, the result will be endlessly better.EDIT: I loved it even more the second time. Multiple action sequences give me goosebumps, similar to how I feel when watching the Dark of the Moon highway scene and the Optimus rage scene at the end. And I can't believe I didn't mention it originally, but the musical score is AMAZING. It elevates every scene and gives me the feels.(3 viewings, early fan screening UltraScreen 6\/7\/2023, UltraScreen 6\/14\/2023, SuperScreen 7\/3\/2023)",

I think I'm bias because the movie takes place in 1994, a good year for me and a good time for music which was used very effectively to give you a vibe of New York (or rather Brooklyn) in general. I will be blunt on how the Black and Brown culture meshing with the Transformers also realty gave the franchise a breath of fresh air. It's strange how that works. Black and LantinX has existed forever yet somehow putting it in a movie franchise about giant robots from space gave it a uniqueness that gets attention.As Martin Scorsese would say \"it's a roller coaster ride\", but I love roller coaster rides. The Action was fantastic beautiful visual scenes but I'll admit my one nick pick would be don't see it in 3D. The format flattens the visual effects making everything look faker than it already is.Also love the interaction of the humans and Transformers. The Transformers have more personality now than they did as basic background for Michael Bay's film.Plus, there are some bells and whistles that truly put the smile of the 8-year kid on my face.Worth it!",

Directed by Steven Caple Jr. And set in the 1990s, the film introduces a fresh narrative revolving around the Maximals, Predacons, and the Autobots, which adds a unique twist to the beloved Transformer saga.The visual effects are undoubtedly a highlight, with impressive CGI that brings the massive robots to life in spectacular battles. The action sequences are exhilarating, featuring dynamic choreography and breathtaking visuals that keep you on the edge of your seat. The vibrant settings, from urban landscapes to lush jungles, also contribute to the film's overall aesthetic appeal.While the action and visuals shine, the plot feels somewhat formulaic. The story follows familiar patterns seen in previous Transformers films, and at times it lacks the depth and nuance needed to elevate it beyond a straightforward sci-fi action flick. Some character development falls by the wayside, leading to a few underwhelming performances.That said, the chemistry between the human characters provides some heartfelt moments, and the humor scattered throughout the film adds levity to the intense action. The voice performances of the Transformers themselves, particularly those of the new characters, breathe life into the story and provide a sense of personality that fans will appreciate.Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is an entertaining rollercoaster that delivers what fans have come to expect - thrilling action and spectacular visuals. While it may not rewrite the rulebook for the franchise, it's a fun addition that continues to build the expansive Transformers universe. Perfect for a summer blockbuster, it's a movie worth seeing for fans looking to enjoy light-hearted escapism.",

        "body":"While this film isn't groundbreaking it gives fans of the franchise some hope of a resurgence. The film takes place in 1994 and it lends itself to that time period with the music choices and the aesthetics of New York. Anthony Ramos's character was that of a stereotypical Latino from New York. In the film he's down on his luck searching for a job to help his single mother take care of his ailing younger brother. While out trying to make money illegally he gets caught up with the transformers who are trying to retrieve an artifact.Ramos is funny in his role and his chemistry with Pete Davidson (Mirage) works well. There was a point in the film where he took charge of the situation and it came off as a bit forced. Overall, I enjoyed his performance and what he added to this film. The direction of his character during the final battle added to the entertainment of this film.Dominique Fishbacks's character started off interesting but by the time the film ended she was underwhelming. More could have been done with her character.Dean Scott Vasquez was okay as he added a bit of humor but some of his scenes that were meant to be emotional weren't as touching as the film tried to make them.The landscapes of Peru were very beautiful to see and it was nice seeing the action taken away from the city. The character designs were nice but some of the characters were underutilized (Cheetah, Rhino...). The beasts were shown here and there but it felt like a very surface level introduction. The villain had a clear-cut motive which helped carry the story.In all this film was a decent introduction to these new characters with room for improvement.

Dare I say the film finished better than most transformer films to date.The beasts: primal and crew, was awesome. One scene when he and Optimus prime teamed up, classic.Dominique\/Elena was good. She added a lot to the film.Anthony\/Noah was ok but his whole family background wasn't needed. The poor boy blah blah blah was tiresome and I found myself bored in the beginning.Lastly, Pete. He's funny and all I get it. But with bumblebee getting a serious back seat, I wasn't happy.But as I started this rant, the last hour or so was awesome. And it was a nice treat at the end, that definitely left me with anticipation for the future.",

        "body":"\"Rise of the beasts\" but doesn't feel like a beasts was rising. 5 years of waiting a new Transformers film after Bumblebee (2018), I was expecting some Optimus Prime solo film or maybe some decent Transformers film but what we got is some mixed up faction betwen Autobots, Maximals and Terrorcons.The problem with this film is that they introduce some of new characters but they force it into 1 hours film which is a mistake, this film should've been a 2 hours because there were new characters that we've never seen before in live action and they need some backstory about this new charactes. They only focus with the backstory about the humans which is boring because they got more screentime than the Maximals and i feel dissappointed with Rhinox and Cheetor, they have less screentime.The transformation of robots in this film was kinda boring. In the bayverse the transformation of the Transformers feels like a slow but fast and smooth and we can see clearly how do they transform into robots. In this film the transformation was kinda fast and the CGI was kinda greyish so it's very hard to see what they transform into.And oh god what have they done with Wheeljack. Wheeljack is such a useless character in this film. This film can work without Wheeljack. They change his design, his voice, his personality and worstly he doesn't even do anything in this film beside chasing Battletrap with Arcee.Unicron? They should just make a movie about Autobots fighting The Decepticons because they really have a balls of steel to use Unicron in the first film Transformers in the reboot universe. I mean come on man this was a second film in the reboot universe and they just straight introduce us to Unicron. They should just do with Unicron later because this universe need more fresh story. It feels like a DCEU film when we got to introduce with Superman and then he fight Batman in the next film and then in the next film they introduce Darkseid.The only things i like about this film is the soundtrack. Steve Jablonsky is back and he use his original Transformers 2007 theme in this film and i was surprise at the end of the film and Optimus Prime did his final speech after 6 years the last time he did his final speech in Transformers The Last Knight.(Sorry for the bad English because I live in Asia)",

That is absolutely not due to the effects, because they are very good, but story-wise it is all very weak and at times even a bit childish. Fortunately, the makers kept the running time very decently at just over 2 hours and did not stretch over the two and a half hours like the other films. Yes, the film is worth watching on the big screen, but it is suspected that it will not look as good on your home screen because it is less impressive.

        "body":"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts combines the character focused approach of Bumblebee with the bombast of the previous Bay films for a great globe trotting adventure that wastes no time and strikes a much better balance in screen time given to its human and Transformers characters, even if the beasts themselves are actually surprisingly underutilized.Anthony Ramos gives a really good lead performance, he's easy to root for and has genuinely strong relationships with Optimus Prime and Mirage. Mirage is the standout with Pete Davidson voicing the character, the constant quips never get annoying and he still has an emotional connection to Noah as well.Peter Cullen is always perfect as Optimus Prime and this is undoubtedly some of his best work in the live action films. Its what Bay was going for in his later installments but done better, an Optimus Prime who's not the ideal leader but a selfish, broken one carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.Steven Caple Jr.'s direction is strong overall, the fights can get a little chaotic but a second act chase and third act final battle are still a lot of fun. The music by Jongnic Bontemps wisely chooses to lay off the nostalgia for the most part, creating its own epic score and using classic pieces sparingly.The soundtrack does a good job making it easy to adjust to the time jump and making it feel authentic and the CG is impressive overall. There's obviously a few weak spots throughout but it's still maintains that balance between realistic details and more animated flourishes.",

While the human characters may have been quite forgettable, the Transformers themselves were fun. I liked the way they used Unicron in this one compared to in TLK when they decided to stupidly make Earth Unicron.

They track the Key to the planet of the Maximals. Some manage to escape to Earth with the Key. It's 1994. Noah Diaz (Anthony Ramos) can't get a job and is recruited to steal a car. The car turns out to be Autobot Mirage. Meanwhile, museum intern Elena Wallace (Dominique Fishback) uncovers the Key which alerts Optimus Prime. Scourge is soon to follow.The Transformers franchise is on the road to recovery. I don't know if it will get there. At least, it doesn't suck anymore. Michael Bay is no longer directing and it has basically three effects. The action is no longer so chaotic. I get the sense that Bay has been trying to top himself in these movies and it just got out of hand. The second effect is his bad sense of humor. It was getting cringeworthy. This one has its humor. It's light and fun. Finally, the story makes sense. In the same way like the action, Michael Bay's story telling was getting unhinged. This movie has a simple story told well enough.

It's obnoxious, it's lazy, and it's stupid.

There isn't any other word for it. Thankfully, the franchise was rebooted after 5 movies (which saw the transformers in a very.... different light). So there isn't anything atrociously bad about this movie. The writing isn't exactly lazy. There isn't any unnecessary, vulgar humour (yeah god knows what the previous movies were thinking). Transformers had gotten to a point that this alone feels nice.The movie kicks off with a great 1st act. But it just slows down in the middle. Then it finally picks up with a nice final act.The writing still isn't good. The human characters are still very boring and keep dragging the movie down. The character of Elena, especially, feels so unnecessary (nothing like Hailee Steinfeld's character in Bumblebee). You can clearly see from the plot that the writers are constantly looking for something for Elena to do and it feels so forced. The character of Noah is fine. There are times when I liked the direction they took with him, but there are times when it was just cringey.But most of the time when the transformers are on the screen, it's very fun. Mirage was a wonderfully fun character and it was great to see him interact with Noah. There is also a great car chase scene with him early on. I also liked how they wrote Optimus' character. Rather than just being the big noble leader, they gave him problems to confront, which made him actually feel like a character for once. Even Bumblebee has a GREAT scene - easily my favourite scene of the movie. And the visuals were great to see. Every shot just felt very polished and colorful.In the end, I'm disappointed but I don't regret watching it. This movie has made me believe that there is a great transformers movie out there somewhere. But it has also made me realise that I'm not going to get that movie anytime soon. This movie is another step in the right direction for this franchise, but they're walking slowly.",

        "body":"Rebooting a franchise isn't easy, especially one with such beloved and iconic characters as the Transformers. However, the latest installment, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, has achieved this feat with spectacular results, making it not just a pleasant surprise, but arguably one of the best movies in the Transformers franchise to date.A pleasant surprise for modern blockbusters is its computer-generated imagery (CGI). The quality of the CGI in \"Rise of the Beasts\" are not a muddied mess we've come to expect with modern blockbusters, and is arguably the best I've seen in a while. The Autobots, and the newly introduced Predacons and Maximals look incredible.The narrative offers an engaging blend of the familiar and fresh, exploring further into the Transformers mythos. Long-time fans will appreciate this movie, finally seeing the Maximals on the silver screen.However, \"Rise of the Beasts\" is not without its drawbacks. The most notable among them is a sense of disproportion in its story's elements. The movie leans too heavily on human interaction, reducing the robot action that the audience so dearly craves. We do understand the need for human characters to anchor the story and bridge the gap between our world and the Transformers'. Still, the franchise is about 'Robots in Disguise,' and we'd love to see more from these fascinating mechanical protagonists.The third act's story seems a bit underwhelming. The plot's culmination feels somewhat lazy, like a hurried wrap-up instead of a thoughtfully designed climax. The only positive to the climax is an epic bot-bashing fight that the film should have more of throughout instead of leaning on the human element as much as it does.But it's not all doom and gloom. The franchise appears to be on an upward trajectory, gearing up to expand its universe in the most thrilling way. The end credits scene is an electrifying surprise that creates a wave of anticipation for fans. It hints at bigger and bolder things to come, setting up future installments and universe building.To sum up, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is an exciting rollercoaster ride that impresses with good CGI and reinvigorates the franchise. Despite its imperfections, the film delivers on the promise of epic, otherworldly adventure that the Transformers brand has become synonymous with. If you are a fan of towering bots, interstellar wars, and bot-smashing visual effects, this movie is a must-watch. And remember, stay until the mid-credits scene.The future for the Transformers franchise looks bright indeed, and \"Rise of the Beasts\" plays an integral part in this promising horizon. We can only hope the subsequent films bring us more robot action, and more of the transforming titans we love. After all, in the world of the Transformers, there's always more than meets the eye. This movie is Miko approved, 7.5\/10.",

After seeing these films back-to-back, I found Rise of the Beasts to be significantly more enjoyable. The first half alone is better than anything in Fast X.Paramount seems to be course-correcting pretty well after all of the damage Michael Bay did to the brand. This and Bumblebee were both pretty enjoyable films. Yes, there's still the 3rd act bombast and spectacle, but it's a lot easier to tell what's going on in this film. The jungle setting is also quite refreshing from the endless skyscrapers in the other movies. I still don't think we need so much emphasis on humans, but it is handled much better here. The soundtrack is also lots of fun and I loved the overall 90s hip hop vibe. It's definitely a bit cheesy, but there are some fun moments in the climax that made me crack a smile.Rise of the Beasts won't blow you away, but it's a nice, enjoyable step forward for a franchise that needed some new life.I will say that the post credits stinger is kinda nuts, but on-brand for the cinematic world we live in now lol.",

        "body":"First, I have really enjoyed a number of the Transformers movies despite the usual criticisms. They were, generally, fun, well thought out intl terms of action scenes and had a few key actors to give them a little more appeal. This one seems to have the casting and script all wrong. The supposed academic is barely able to string a sentence together and is wholly unconvincing as someone who could work out how to get out of the bathroom let alone anything else (also the actress is dire but hardly the point). The main actor is uninspiring and deals with the awful script with seeming boredom (I doubt it is genuine boredom as this is presumably his big break) and the cutesy nod to the 90s for the transformers themselves seems, well, meh? Overall, boring, badly acted, shocking casting and a sad epitaph.",

I like the action sequences and fight scenes. The villains were boring. No growth with every character that was in it. Beast machines had little screen time.

        "body":"The fact that the silliest thing in this very silly movie (non-derogatory) is printed on a business card is a testament to just how ridiculous and left-field the final few moments of 'Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts (2023)' truly are. What a world we live in.It's odd that none of the voice actors get named in the main-on-end credits, not only because they deserve to be listed alongside the live-action cast (most of whom have far less screen time) but also because there are some really big names that shouldn't be hidden in the end crawl.This is closer to Bay than Knight, but it's by no means bad. It's a zippy, if slightly overlong, adventure that leans into its absurdities with a straight face and a steady hand. It lacks any real semblance of style or wit, but it isn't totally lifeless and it's far from the crass mess most of the movies in its series unfortunately are. The human characters get a considerable amount of play and, to be honest, they actually outshine the giant robots around them. That's not because they're especially compelling, even though they're likeable and well performed, but because most of their metallic counterparts aren't really characters so much as special effects. A couple of the autobots and maximals get more play than the others and they're decent enough for what they are, but the majority do little other than scrap with terrorcons and ominously talk about the end of the world. Even the so-called great leader Optimus Prime comes across more as a murderous maniac than a commander fighting for peace (though that's nothing new), spending most of the feature telling the intimidating main villain that he's going to kill him and absolutely eviscerating anything he can get his hands on. The film is generally rather bland and forgettable, lacking any real excitement and featuring mostly unmoving set-pieces. It takes too long for the autobots to actually get involved, too. There are a handful of fun moments and the piece is generally entertaining enough for what it is, but it does leave something to be desired. It's a blockbuster without a spark, but it isn't quite a hollow shell.",

Scourge was the best villain I've seen in a live action TF movie! So while we have YET to Megatron in this new reboot... he's got to be much more... insane and calculating than Scourge was here!The actors...I will admit I did not like Elena at first but by the end she grew on me.Did I say there were more transformer characters!?The music (well, the incidental music anyway) was really good.The little brother's plight added a sentimental touch and helped the main character (Anthony's)move his story arc fairly well.The length was not overly long for a TF movie!!!!The bad:\nWheeljack's head\/face. He should have just been called a different name!The Beast characters finally get some action near the end... but we rarely got to see them in Bot mode which was a shame... Rhinox had some speaking lines... but only in a deleted scene! (ARGH!)\nThe subtitle should have centered on Mirage. While this is not our G1 Mirage... I liked him! This was HIS movie, like Bumblebee carried his. The movie was misnamed.The 90s stuff in the beginning was...okay. I'm sure some people will get a kick out of some pop tunes from that era (again they are trying to center the movie on maximal characters which are NOT the main cast for the sake of the time Beast Wars was on TV.)... While the 'era' was fine... the whole PC angle just left a bad taste in my mouth. Don't remember anyone with issues getting jobs during that era like that... maybe in the 1950s... but I was unemployed myself in the 90s and I'm 'whyte' as I saw many other people that didn't look like me getting jobs I waa trying to simply get an Interview for! (Anyway)... still it was that overall part of the plot (while slow to start) really picks up when someone tries to steal a Porsche... THEN it turns into Transformers! And it doesn't stop after that!!Overall I'd watch it again easily. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad. Hope the next movie centers around Megatron. If you expect seeing Primal, Cheetor and Rhinox having adventures... nope not this movie. But still overall not a bad movie in the same vein as Bumblebee.",

        "body":"Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.\"Dune: Part 2\" is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind. As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. The plot and story development are carried out in an awe-inspiring manner throughout the movie, progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does. The film received praise from many great filmmakers, the most notable being Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Oppenheimer), who very accurately compared Villeneuve's achievement in this film to the \"Empire Strikes Back\" of the modern era.Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained. More specifically, one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part. Of course, for those who really want to enjoy the story, there's no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one. However, even those who watched it a few years ago and don't remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt. 2 and will understand all the important details-even the smaller ones. Non-ideally, even someone who hasn't watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one, as it is very self-contained despite relying heavily on the first movie-an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers.Timothée Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance, to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play. Zendaya also gives a very good performance, with significantly more screen time than in the first movie. Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain, Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year, and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie. In addition to them, the film is filled with top-tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly.Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. While the first part was excellent, it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel. In \"Part 2,\" the story reaches its climax, with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades, befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy\/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.While the movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1, in my opinion it could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in \"Dune: Messiah\", which I really hope will get green-lit soon.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy\/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended.",

Also, Hans Zimmer.For book readers, I'd say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn't fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally.I know it's early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress.

The emotional connection between Paul and Chani, so vital to the story, is completely lacking and unbelievable. The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen.I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things, but she has basically 2 facial expressions here, and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul. I found her to be the worst part of this movie.The final fight scene is short, choppy, and a mess. It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling\nThe Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish. The ending was super abrupt, and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel.I want to reiterate that this isn't a bad movie. Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing, but he can't give life to individual characters.It is like he can't see the trees for the forest.",

This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied. In De Villeneuve's hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about, both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother. For example, in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing.Having left this essence out of the movies, they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience.

This film will go down as one of the best in sci-fi\/fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted. Not in the longest time has a franchise, and a singular movie, captivated me in such a way. This story, these characters, this planet, Dune, lives rent-free in my mind. You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX, as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene. This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling. 10\/10.",

The characters, acting, screenplay, world building, storytelling, score, actions sequences, cinematography, and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece. Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking. The casting continuation was perfect all the way through, with great new add-ons. Timothee Chalamet is believable, raw and real as Paul Atriedes. He was flawless as the lead. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil. Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts.Overall, Dune: Part Two is an inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale. It's a fantastic piece of filmmaking, rarely seen in modern day cinema.",

Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling. Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone, like George Clooney.Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours. All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don't go to movies to be entertained. Between the acting of Zendaya, Dave Bautista, Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting, assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting.It's time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not.",

The action sequences ARE good when they actually happen (which is not very often.) The actors are all good actors. But they're both just straight up boring films to the core.I don't understand how people write reviews calling it 'masterpiece' or 'the peak of film making.' I just don't believe they could actually be entertained by the straight up DEAD story and DEAD dialogue for what seemed for the whole movie. The only piece of dialogue I actually remember being somewhat entertaining was when Timothy Chalamet said to Josh Brolin 'I recognise your footsteps.' I'm not missing anything, I'm sure. It was just...nothing. I couldn't wait for it to end.It just seems to me people are lying because they want to 'seem' smart because this was an acclaimed novel and had been made into a movie before in the past. Or they're just Timothy Chalamet groupies (I'm a big fan of him as an actor in his other work) and just want him to do well. I refuse to believe anyone found the plot of this movie good (thus making it entertaining) and it's not like it made up for the lack of story with amazing story telling through action like Mad Max Fury Road did. Can anyone think of any other reasons why people would really rate this movie even close to a 10\/10?",

Denis never lets you out of this experience! The pure weight of the film is presented through astounding narratives, rich cinematography, an epic story and mesmerizing action sequences that will make your seat rumble if you watch this on the big screen!There are quite a handful of thrilling moments that I still have no idea how they came out THIS good in the end! Denis Villeneuve is truly a sorcerer in the Sci-Fi genre! Every frame and detail in his films are captivating as hell, and it's no different here in the slightest!Dune: Part Two made me leave the theater feeling inspired!

I loved the first movie and thought it would be an impossibly difficult task to surpass it, but Denis Villeneuve has once again proven himself as the most promising sci-fi director of this age. I find that this installment of the series picks up its pace quickly and reaches its peak near the end of the film. Contrary to the first film where most of the action was packed into the middle. Dune: Part Two displays a more relaxed tone from the start to the middle of the movie, however the mood shifts to match the occasion and finally leaves you somewhat distraught as the consequences of the character's choices surely lead to a path they cannot return from. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is once again fantastic the mixture of his naturalistic style and the sci-fi genre leads to a grounded universe while still retaining the wonderous and whimsical aspects of science fiction, each decision on how planets and characters are portrayed demonstrates the care and attention paid to how audiences interpret them, you understand the Harkonnen, the Emperor, the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit and the remnants of house Atreides in one look at the way they are shown. The score is once again sublime, Hans Zimmer once again proves himself as the definitive motion picture composer, his ability to craft larger-than-life scores with his ability to understand the differences between each character and culture present in this film is nothing short of perfection, recurring themes and motifs are present throughout the movie and paired with the visuals and the performances, which are also incredible, form a modern day masterpiece crafted meticulously by masters of their respective fields. Rebecca Ferguson, Timothée Chalamet, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler and Zendaya give wonderful performances, with the first three being standouts. Overall this movie deserves the universal praise it has received and might just interest those who didn't even enjoy the first installment of the series.",

All viallians feel quite weak, bland, and never seem to pose any real threat. Bautista's character is a joke, Baron isn't threatening, and the new villian (being called as good as joker by some people) also feels very generic. The *new abilities* that Paul gets also feel too convenient and easy to get.2. Characters change a lot instantly, Jessica suddenly becomes this completely different character, and same goes with Paul.3. I can see how it may have to be rushed in the movie format, but the pacing could've been better.4. Paul is the prophesied prophet, and... That just happens with no surprises etc. In some ways, I think that was for the better, as it avoids the overdone struggling hero cliche, but I was prepared to feel tense for Paul, but never really felt that there was a reason to feel tense.Overall, it's a solid 8\/10, it is a technical masterpiece if you look at cinematography etc., but as a movie overall, it's just another 'good watch' which is well worth its time, and that's completely fine.",

But surely thing might have been different if he was on board.They changed the color palette also from the first movie.it was a little bluish in the first part which suited it but here they changed it and it looks quite different.It goes on with slow story telling and becomes really fast paced in the last 30 or 45 minutes.I am not saying it's a bad movie but what you expect after watching the first part it's not at that level.Behaviour of characters was also one dimensional and wasn't explored properly. Maybe because they had to fill so many things in 2.45 hours of time.You know extended version of 4 hours would work for this movie because there is so much to add or explain.But as we know it would never come out.Rest acting,music, cinematography all are good like the first part.You will like it but after it will be over you will be left with a feeling of something missing out from it.Let's hope the next part would be much more thrilling than this one.I believe in Denis Villeneuev and he is one of the best director of our time and i will watch whatever he will make.",

There's barely any dialog--at least not any that would explain anything what's going on at all. The world and the technology etc just doesn't make much sense to me.None of the characters are particularly interesting, to be honest. They don't really have that much personality to them, and even if they did, they didn't really make me care about them all that much.I don't know, I'm a bit conflicted, it wasn't a bad movie and, as I said, it was entertaining and visually mesmerizing, but it lacked the depth that I was expecting of a world this size and this rich with lore and history. Maybe the movie makers assumed everyone has read the books? As someone to who the world is not familiar at all, it just seems rather confusing and strange.

What really hit the mark for me is Austin Butler's performance, with his coarse voice and intense demeanor. In fact, the whole sequence on Geidi Prime was for me the best moment of the movies, with the bleak, oppressive lightning of a black sun. Science-fiction at its best.Alas, one aspect lessened my pleasure and it is Zendaya as Chani. I don't know why Hollywood insist so much into giving her femme fatale roles, but each and every time I didn't believe it; Instead of seing the character, all I can see is the same rather plain-looking actress, with her limited range. Maybe she just didn't found her niche yet.On the other hand of the acting spectrum, Bautista is under-rated as an actor here, offering an emotional, convincing performence. In fact nearly all actors were very good, up to par with the technical team. Those movies get better with every viewing. A solid 8 stars.",

Lynch's Dune was bizarre, had that beloved retro sci-fi vibe, WAY more memorable character designs, and just left more of an impression on me. Accuracy between books and their movies is also a divisive topic, but unless the author is making the movie themself, why expect perfect duplication?My recommendation: unless you're a die-hard Dune fan, you can definitely skip this one.",

        "body":"I saw Dune 2 on an XD screen and sound system. Visually, Dune 2 was jaw dropping. The sound was intense, and at times, too loud and droning. If you are interested in seeing this movie, it is worth seeing on a big screen.Though I was fully engaged for its 2 hour and 46 minute run time, I would not call Dune 2 a masterpiece. Most characters acted emotionally flat. I also felt the romance between Paul and Chani was not convincing. When the story was reaching its climax, I did not care about the characters. I also think the movie should have spent a little time on setup about the Fremen. I get that they are oppressed by the Harkonnen, but their sacrifices and lost freedom should be shown to the viewer so we understand the emotional motivation to do a full assault on the Harkonnen.Austin Butler was so intense in the movie. It illustrates his acting range. I hope he is recognized for his performance.And here are some little nit-picky criticisms. They don't address how the Fremen eat. In terms of world building, these sort of details are necessary to make the world believable. I'm not convinced humans could survive on Arrakis. There is no way you could grow crops and raise animals. Did they eat synthetic food? The planet also couldn't sustain gigantic worms. These huge beasts would have to consume millions of calories a day, which is not available. Showing the details of a sustainable life on such a dry planet would help with believability. And the voice control thing done by the Bene Gesserit is sort of dumb. I know this is from the book, but that part of the book doesn't hold up over time.",

However, what I encountered left me feeling underwhelmed and disconnected. The film seemed to lack the spark that ignites the imagination, opting instead for a plodding pace that failed to engage me fully.Perhaps it was my own weariness or a misalignment with the source material, but I struggled to find moments worth revisiting after the credits rolled. The supposed \"best scenes\" seemed to blur together in a haze of monotony, leaving me searching for a standout moment or two to cling to.While I can appreciate the efforts of the filmmakers and the ambition behind bringing such a beloved story to life, I can't help but feel that the overwhelming hype surrounding this adaptation is somewhat unwarranted. Despite its visual spectacle and star-studded cast, Dune 2 left me yearning for a deeper connection and a stronger emotional resonance that simply wasn't present.In the end, while the film may find its audience among die-hard fans of the franchise or those with a particular affinity for its themes, for me, it fell short of the lofty expectations set by its predecessors and failed to leave a lasting impression.",

        "body":"Frank Herbert's Dune is widely considered to be some of the most challenging science fiction material to adapt to the big screen. In 2021, Villeneuve hit it out of the park with Dune - Part One. In Part Two, he outdoes himself in every way. From cinematography to music to choreography to acting and dialogue, this movie had a mountain to climb to prove itself, and it did.With Hans Zimmer composing the score, it should surprise no one how well it compliments the film. Greig Fraser (Dune - Part One, The Creator, The Batman) was at the helm of cinematography, and really took my breath away with the magnificent vistas, incredible use of colours and even infrared, and expert capture of motion and scale. Fraser explains that they shot in digital, transposed to 35mm, then back to digital. This seemed absurd to me, until he explained that digital appeared too crisp for audiences, and film too nostalgic. His method obtained the perfect balance. I can't fault him for that, because I agree.The real risk here is of course the adaptation. How to retain some of the richest and most beloved science fiction lore in existence and condense it into the 2 hours and 46 minutes runtime. Villeneuve took a huge risk by splitting the first book into two parts. Had studios not green-lit part two, we would have been left with half a book. Unsatisfying for everyone. Thankfully the gamble paid off, and he was able to tell the epic story across two movies bordering on three hours. Even this required a brisk pace, with many notable scenes omitted. Despite this, I think Villeneuve retained the heart and soul of the story. He created two movies which appeal to both general audiences, and fans alike. There is so much to love here that I can't imagine anyone walking away feeling unsatisfied with the price of entry.See this on the biggest screen you can find. Then see it again. The visuals and score demand it. You will not be disappointed.",

But it was also very slow and showed little in the way of characters and personalities. It was big...but also a bit disappointing despite this bigness. Fortunately, this second film, while also slow, is a bit more interesting to watch and it's battle scenes must have been truly amazing to watch on the big screen. And, fortunately, it also gives does a bit more in making a few of the major characters more fully fleshed out an interesting. While not a perfect version of the second portion of the Frank Herbert book, it is very good and well worth seeing.My only regrets about the film were minimal. First, the worm scenes were far less interesting than I'd hoped as you barely see them and they only come partially out of the ground. Also, I had to laugh at how many of the battles involved swords...in a sci-fi epic?! So many swords...when a machine gun or tank would have been so much better! Still, these are very minor quibbles and the film is well worth your time.I might say more but there are well over 2000 reviews. So, 'nuff said.",

The lack of dialogue didn't work for me, although it's an aspect that would lessen the more I learned about the characters and world. I just don't get much of a chance at that within the movie. Despite my uninvolvement of the Dune world and its characters, I still have to be honest with the faults of the script and editing.Other than the overarching plot, scenes happen rather than you being lead into scenes via an emotional journey. The first hour is a back and forth of random tests and does she like him or not. Many characters simply appear in the movie, some deep into the runtime, including a main villain who has no discernible traits other than evil for the sake of it. Some characters appear very briefly and don't do much at all. The motivation of everyone was stripped out of the script. We see an abundant amount of screen time on someone riding a worm, but large battles will abrubtly end after very little setup. Did we need a large segment of screen time involving the nukes, when we could've just been told that there's nukes? The nuke scene feels as a standout filler sequence perhaps to be overshadow a few dozen moments of filler that could've been replaced with plot.I would challenge the praisers of this film to explain why everything was perfect. Austin Butler's character was great! Why? Because he was so one dimensional? The battles are the best! You mean snippets of battles that we got and one where it was hard to tell who was who. The score was amazing! Oh, the unbelievably overused bong noise that will randomly appear in the most tepid of scenes? Even the \"twist\" ending was foreshadowed in the first few minutes. This film is all spectacle with no emotional payoff. The number one praise that people will use to describe greatness of Dune 2 is the cinematography. This should be a leg that a great movie stands on, not the foundation. Although the direction and technicality of the look of Dune 2 is epic, the writing and editing are faulty. Maybe upon rewatches I would like it more since I might understand more of the details (after getting those details from other sources), but it's still nowhere as good as it could be or as most everyone seems to think it is.",

A Part 3 is of course necessary but until we get one, it's a duo. And then it fits perfectly: Part One is 1.5 acts of the story and we're left with a dazzling display of intensity.Hans Zimmer continues what he many times referred to as a project that is really close to him, and it shows. After releasing additional 2 albums full of almost 4 hours of music besides the official Dune Part One soundtrack, he continues his quest for the true soul of Dune (in my opinion) - the music.Which leads me to my next point: you HAVE TO watch it in IMAX. It will blow you away.

Or...you didn't like the first part (or didn't watch it), in which case you are not going to the Cineplex to check out the sequel.If you ARE going to see this film, the BankofMarquis strongly recommends you see it in theaters with the best sound and largest screen possible...for 2 reasons.Reason 1: This film is visually and audibly stunning. It is a feast for the eyes and ears. Director Villeneuve (and all involved in the production, costume, sound and Fx design) have topped the very high bar they set for themselves with the first Dune and expect this film to rake in ALL of these types of awards come next Oscars' season. They visually (and audibly) credibly present new worlds in such a way that you are sure that the movie was filmed on location when (in fact) it is all pretty much green sky. An amazing technical achievementReason 2: It's a good thing that this film is visually and audibly stunning, because the storyline itself, is rather boring and somewhat complex. This is the fault of the source novel as Dune (and it's sequels) are just as interested in the politics and back room dealings of how you turn a hero into a Messiah (with a ton of backstory and plot development thought by the characters - never a good way to present a movie). So you will want to watch this in a theater so you can keep focused on the plot (as opposed to at home where you will be tempted to pick up your phone, pet the dog, go make a sandwich etc.) and not miss some of the intricacies.Caught between Reason 1 and Reason 2 are a laundry list of performers and performances that are struggling to match the technical achievements of Dune: Part Two while acting against a green screen with some long, boring speeches and some very clunky dialogue.Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson and Charlotte Rampling all return from the first part and they are \"just fine\", not really elevating things, but not bringing them down either. They gamely bring their best to a rather difficult and thankless job.Thank goodness Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are back as their characters bring some life and energy to the proceedings while Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Lea Seydoux, Stellan Skarsgard and (especially) Christopher Walken (!) are wasted in their roles, really being more of a piece of furniture to move around rather than anything that represents an interesting character.Only Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha brings new excitement to the 2nd half of this 2 hour and 40 minute epic and, by that point in this film, it is much needed.Come to DUNE: PART TWO for the visual and sound achievements and stay for...the visual and sound achievements - and the setup to the inevitable sequel.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling, Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch. The pacing is irregular, at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed. Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material, you don't get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made. Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films, is probably not doing the story justice, should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work, therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely.",

The vast, sweeping dunes of sand and the breathtaking scenes of giant-worm riding traverse the expansive desert landscape, leaving audiences mesmerized throughout.The introduction of Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha adds a compelling layer of malevolence, while the demise of the Harkonnen leader is satisfyingly intricate, avoiding simplicity. The film culminates in an epic duel between Paul Atreides and Feyd-Rautha, delivering an elegantly crafted and thrilling conclusion.Timothée Chalamet's performance as Paul Atreides, the prophesied Lisan al-Gaib, is nothing short of extraordinary. His portrayal of the chosen leader is so captivating that it becomes impossible to look away from the screen. The narrative remains faithful to Frank Herbert's novel, capturing the essence of the epic tale while hinting that \"the war has just begun.\"While the novel doesn't extend to a Part Three, the expansive universe of Dune offers numerous sequels in the books. With the right efforts and approvals, there is hope for more cinematic adaptations in the future. For now, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a monumental achievement that demands to be seen, and I eagerly anticipate experiencing it again, this time with my beloved by my side.",

Jesus, how wrong I was! It's an absolute masterpiece and something that lives in you. Some may be turned off by the fact that the entire film is based mainly on dialogues and building relationships, but I am sure that for those few, including myself, it will be a masterpiece on par with Star Wars for our fathers. This is what genre cinema should look like, not robots saving the galaxy and women in tight leggings jumping on buildings (yes, I'm talking about you Marvel)The best movie I've seen in many, many, many years :)",

Aw it last night and it was a bit of a disappointment for me.I felt that this movie relied way more heavily on loud special effects like explosions and fire power than the character exploration of Part One. Saw this is Dolby Cinema. Sometimes the music and the sound track was louder than the actors and it was hard to hear what they were saying. It made it hard to follow what was happening.And then there were a couple of other things: The Stilgar character was reduced to a fanatical buffoon. It seemed out of character from how Bardem delivered him in Part One.And oh, how about Zendaya? If this was the first time I saw her on screen I'd say keep your day job. For some reason her character was reduced to literally one facial expression the entire 2 hours and 45 minutes! It was bizarre.Don't get me wrong, however, I still liked the movies and there were some scene that were truly top notch. I just think Part One is measurably better.",

        "body":"Dune Part 2 is a visually stunning yet somewhat disjointed cinematic experience.Villeneuve's direction is undeniably ambitious, and his signature style of breathtaking visuals is on full display in Dune. The black and white scenes, reminiscent of archival footage from fascist Germany, are particularly striking and add a unique aesthetic to the storytelling.However, the overall pacing and editing of the film leave something to be desired. The narrative flow is often disrupted by abrupt cuts and seemingly unconnected scenes. It appears that an abundance of material was shot, and the process of trimming it down to a manageable length may have been a challenging one. Despite these efforts, the film still clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours and 46 minutes.The plot of Dune Part 2 bears some resemblance to the TV series Game of Thrones, with its complex political machinations, warring factions, and power struggles. However, the film's storytelling falls short in comparison to the depth and intricacy of the HBO series. The limited runtime of a theatrical release may have constrained the filmmakers' ability to fully explore the richness of the source material. Perhaps a television adaptation would have been a more suitable format to delve into the nuances of the Dune universe and its characters.In terms of performances, Austin Butler's portrayal of Feyd-Rautha is a standout. Butler brings a magnetic presence and charisma to the role, overshadowing even the lead actor, Timothée Chalamet, who plays Paul Atreides. Chalamet struggles to match the intensity and allure of Butler's Feyd-Rautha, and his performance is merely a shadow in comparison.Overall, Dune Part 2 is a film that aspires to greatness but falls short in its execution. The visual spectacle and moments of brilliance are undeniable, but the disjointed narrative and uneven pacing prevent it from fully realizing its potential.",

Nobody can say it doesn't have a great cast! And surprisingly and very out of character made by Eli Roth! (Though it doesn't feel like it).VerdictBorderlands was doomed straight out of the gate, and where would I even begin in explaining why.I mean for a start video game adaptations almost always fail. Why? Because generally they're made by Hollywood folks who aren't gamers, so it's not loyal, it misses the target audience and it simply isn't what it was intended to be.Next, the casting. I mean are you serious? This is some of the most confusing baffling casting in the history of the industry and lets look at why.Kevin Hart as Roland? Rolland is a tough guy big muscular soldier. So they cast diddy little Hart? Who thought that was a good idea. He to his credit does his best here, but it just doesn't work.Jamie Lee Curtis as Tannis? Just why? She's 25-30yrs too old to be in that role and her presence in the movie is so minimal she contributes absolutely nothing anyway.Blanchett? Again, too old. And let me be clear she's a fantastic actress and I would consider myself a fan, but she was badly miscast here and as much as she makes the most of it this was a poor choice and should been a role taken by someone in their 20's or even 30's, not 50's.And Tiny Tina? To her credit Greenblatt was great here in her role. But that role is NOT Tiny Tina. Did the writers even play the games for a moment? That was not Tiny Tina in the slightest and shouldn't be considered so.So what with the video game curse and the offensively bad casting the movie was DOA, though to its credit they at least made a trailer that I thought looked like it could be at least half entertaining. Alas you seem to be able to do that with any movie these days because Borderlands isn't half entertaining, in fact I'd argue it's a tenth at best.You see it's your bog standard American Hollywood formulaic CGI laden no brains and all flare foolishness. You'll predict every single scene with absolute ease and hate yourself when it the credits roll for wasting 90 minutes of your life on something which you can with confidence say you could have done better yourself.In my opinion Borderlands isn't bad for the reasons I keep hearing but make absolutely no mistake it's bad.RantsOne of the biggest complaints I keep seeing\/hearingis that it's too cutesy, that it should be more violent, that the creators had clearly never played a Borderlands game because if they had it would be R rated. My response to this, WHY? I've played every Borderlands game and I have no idea why people are saying this.The borderlands games....Sex, none.Nudity, none.Bad language, minimal\nViolence, it's cartoony cel-shaded graphics with minimal blood. It's one rung up the ladder from Fortnite!So no, the movie shouldn't have been R rated because the games most certainly aren't!The GoodBig flashy colorful, all the things that keep your attention\nMost of the performances were actually good despite the poor casting\nQuite a few great nods to fans of the gamesThe BadAwful casting\nThe ending was dire\nToo formulaic.",

        "body":"So right up front I'm HUGE borderlands game fan. Always have been. Now with that in mind I came in with certain expectations. And I'm going to give you an honest review.First the casting, I thought it would be dreadful, but to my surprise even though it wasn't the best casting, the actors did an amazing job playing their respective characters. Having said that the ones I would change out are Tina, Moxie, and Roland. They all did their thing, and it was good for them no doubt, but sadly they were not the right casting for those particular roles.And here's how you can tell. Tina in this movie is a kind of lost girl with explosives, but you get this sense that she kind of needs protecting, and in the game it was completely the opposite. Even the bandits wouldn't mess with her because she was so wildly deranged. That insanity is her defining trait, not having it killed the character. Moxie was more sexy than badass in the game, in the movie the sexiness took a huge backseat and the problem with that is that it IS her personality. You can't just change that in a character. Which brings us to Roland, I love Kevin Hart. And he did a great job portraying Roland, but here's the thing Roland was a completely different physique and completely different personality in the games. He was way more serious, and that's not Kevin's forte, of course it's not, he's a comedian. So like I said, those are just bad casting choices.Now onto the actual movie, the story was... well not the version of the story we had in the games, which is weird because you know the established fanbase wants that story right? It doesn't have to be the same exact one but it has to be close and this one wasn't it. Now even all of this I can forgive, but what I can't forgive is the PG-13 garbage. Borderlands games are a hardcore rated R+ genre, you absolutely can't change it to PG-13, gut the script to have stupid lines that don't go at all with the scenes and expect anyone to like it. It doesn't work.6\/10 Great acting, mediocre casting\/plot, terrible writing. PG-13 rating sunk it.",

Unfortunately, it misses the mark in nearly every way. The plot is riddled with clichés, completely lacking the quirky, dark humor that made the games so unique. The characters feel like hollow imitations of their in-game counterparts, with little of the depth or charm that fans would expect.What's worse, the movie strays far from the source material in a way that feels disrespectful to the original story and its fans. The iconic chaotic energy and vibrant world-building of Pandora are replaced by generic action scenes and uninspired dialogue. Instead of feeling like an immersive dive into the *Borderlands* universe, this film comes off as a shallow, lazy cash grab that misses the essence of what made the games special.For true *Borderlands* fans, this adaptation is a major letdown.

True, there isn't an original thought in it's hundred minute duration and it does look like a very poor relation to a video-game, but it's \"Mad Max\" meets \"Buck Rogers\" vibe just about entertained me. It's all about \"Lilith\" (Cate Blanchett) who is a renowned bounty hunter charged by gazillionaire \"Atlas\" (Edgar Ramirez) with finding his kidnapped daughter \"Tina\" (Ariana Greenblatt). Thing is, she's already been rescued by \"Roland\" (Kevin Hart) and is in no great rush to return to the loving arms of daddy. Whilst trying to track her down, \"Lilith\" encounters the true star of the film - the robot \"Claptrap\", a sarcastic pile of scrap who decides to help out whether she likes it or not, so off they go a-child-hunting. Yep - it proceeds exactly as you'd expect, except for the frankly bamboozling contribution of Jamie Lee Curtis (and her red glasses) who does look like she's enjoying herself on set but, like Blanchett, is just a complete fish out of water as the banal dialogue and set-piece combat scenes pass the entire project into the hands of the CGI developers. This is nothing at all special or memorable, just a predictable action enterprise that takes \"Robot Wars\" to the desert, but if you aim low and take it in the spirit it's clearly intended then it's a perfectly watchable summer adventure.",

The action sequences, which should have been a highlight given the game's emphasis on chaotic and explosive combat, are surprisingly lackluster.

Once again, it's a movie that quite misses the point of what made the games really good as this movie, despite some solid production designs and costumes, its messy writing, poor character engagement, and mixed performances doesn't really do a good service.Roth really tries hard to make this movie feel epic and insane but it all just comes off tedious and annoying at the end. Its approach on the humor, atmosphere and character dynamics lack the charms of the games and is filled with messes and messes. The casting, despite performances being trying, really feels miscasted.I think it's time for studios to learn how to make a good video game movie by watching Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves.",

Based off the successful video game and written and directed by Eli Roth, this movie features an all-star cast including Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Edgar Ramirez, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Jack Black. It debuted on August 9th sporting a 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes which I honestly did not know could happen. I wonder, however, if that score will ultimately help this movie though due to people like me deciding to go see if it really is \"that bad.\"I am happy to say that the movie is not really \"that bad.\" Now, I won't go as far as saying that the movie is necessarily good, but I enjoyed myself while watching it and found it pleasantly entertaining. Full disclosure, I did not play the video game, and I have heard that many people who enjoyed the movie did not either. My suggestion to those who did play the game is to try your hardest to keep the movie and the game separate.My overall rating for Borderlands is a 6\/10 and I consider it a fun summer movie with a lot of violence and some funny one-liners here and there from Jack Black.",

        "body":"People are acting like someone rewrote the Bible or something. Geez. Okay, so first I'll lay down my Borderlands nerd cred so as to be allowed to have an opinion: I played Borderlands when it came out, obsessively. All the DLC's, Platinum trophy, etc. Then Borderlands 2 came out and there went my social life for a few more months. Played the Pre-sequel but wasn't quite as OCD-triggering. But I blamed the game less than just not really caring about video games so much anymore (they don't really mesh so hot with work, girls, life). I'd stopped playing games by Borderlands 3 but doesn't appear to apply to this movie much anyway.So I've established that I enjoyed the video games and the world and invested hours and hours of my life. I enjoyed the snarky humor and repetitive carnage. Fun stuff. That being said, there's really no case to be made for the Borderlands lore or a beloved IP. The games are about scrounging around on a planet-sized scrap heap while gunning down psychopaths in barbed wire codpieces and constantly plowing thru weapons and perks to maximize your destructive capacity. It's a fairly loose criteria, which the movie follows. It's not the most awesome sauce result but it's not like they went and massively changed a lot: Lilith isn't a transsexual android and they're not trying to reverse the effects of global warming on Pandora, or similar changes that get many red states hackles up. It's just...violent but not bloody violent. Ooookay.So I guess my big question to the naysayers is, \"what were you expecting that u didn't get?\" The movie looks right. The characters, the playable ones, never had an over abundance of personality. There's lots of violence and shooting. No loot hunting but I can't imagine that any way but utterly boring on screen:\"Damn this gun rules!!! Pow pow. Oh look, a crate. What's in here? A SLIGHTLY BETTER GUN THAT RELOADS 1.2secs FASTER? Holy turdballs!! I'm gonna take it and throw this old one on the ground, then I'm going to rearrange my backpack for 5mins... damn, this is some exciting cinema!!\"There's been a ton of complaining, much of it preemptive to actually seeing the movie. Most all of the complaints are upset about what they got but very short on what should've been. All seems to amount to \"it should be funnier and bloodier.\" But it's not. It's just like any other video game to movie.. except they actually got a lot right. I'd say more than most games that transistion to film. But no no, gotta go on another Captain Marvel jihad cuz some cinematic widdle feelings have been offended. There's TONS of movies with jokes and blood. They're called horror movies and they do get old but go to town. If that's your main priority than you should be fairy easy to please (unless people are just being churlish and obstinate as a reflex... which is probable).Now there are some valid issues. Kevin Hart is miscast. He does fine I guess it's just not the right dude for the part. Pretty much any game with multiple character classes will have a generic soldier\/warrior and they're usually a tall average dude. They could've gotten Micheal Jai White for waaaay cheaper and had more cash for a decent villain (Edgar Ramirez wasn't that bad actually but he didn't bring much either). Hell, this might be one of the extremely few roles that would've been better with Eric Roberts. But we got Kevin Hart. Oh well, it could've been Tracy Morgan so cut your losses.No, it's not very gory but that never really stood out to me while watching it. I get some people are craving the old ultra-violence but it gets old fast. Desensitizing. No one seems to care that Lilith's gun has infinite ammo. I guess cuz the game does that so it's okay?My biggest issue is the ending. That's where the two directors annd the Eli Roth vs. Studio stank really shines. I don't know what happened before but there's several shots of Jamie Lee Curtis looking up at the climactic action and just awkwardly describing what's happening. Seems pretty clear they changed whatever originally happened then plugged in some reshoots with her going, \"oh wow, look up there at blah blah. This means yadda yadda is happening!\" Smooth.Claptrap was fine, just kinda wasted. The Psycho is a psycho, whatever. Tiny Tina is lame but I don't recall her being super cool in the games. Though it's been years since I played them and things often look better in retrospect. Perhaps others are going off fond memory: like how \"everything Star Wars sucks now cuz it's not as good as (insert whichever one they first saw as a kid). It's called growing up, don't blame the laser swords in space movie.All this backlash might actually help. I didn't really care about this movie at first. Then all this awful stuff came out. Then after that people actually saw the movie and more negative feedback. By then I had sub-zero expectations, figured I'd watch it for kicks and was able to somewhat enjoy it. Doubt I'll go out of my way to watch it again but I'd rather rewatch this than many other worse movies that didn't get inundated with a storm of nasty predictions\/opinions (depending on whether they hated the movie before they actually saw it, if ever).I don't rate anything on here I haven't watched, and completed. If you want to punch out of a movie after 40 grueling minutes that's totally fine. But rating the whole thing without seeing it feels lousy. Same with rating higher to compensate for perceived over-negative ratings. It's entertainment, not a moral crusade. Go play the video game more if u want that experience. The pacing and overall dynamics of the story are totally different between the two mediums. Pointing out how yet another unoriginal movie isn't that great is about as clever as pointing out that poo stinks. Thanks for your guidance oh wise ones. This is a just another meh action movie, but not nearly as bad as the majority I've seen the past decade.I'd be very interested in a directors cut. Kevin Hart would still be a little off but otherwise all the pieces are there, which is more than can be said for many other films.",

As usual, it's painfully obvious that studio executives stepped in and made a bunch of money-based decisions that doomed this film from the beginning.It's also beyond confusing to me as to how Kevin Hart continues to have a career. I have yet to discern what actual talent he has beyond \"I'm a short guy that acts super animated and yells really loud! Don't people find that funny!?\" I am confused every time Kevin is labeled a \"comedian\" because I have never seen him tell what I would consider a joke, and his standup is totally devoid of humor.Hart similarly weighs down this film and demonstrates that yet again, he must have some sort of dirt on studio execs to keep forcing them to put him into movie roles. He has no actual talent or acting skills, a which is only further highlighted in a movie where for once, he isn't acting opposite The Rock the entire film.This film was an utter disaster and complete disappointment for fans of the series, made even worse by casting the insufferable, talentless Kevin Hart and forcing the audience to endure what he calls acting the entire movie.",

A twelve-year-old may find it funny.There are some really dumb moments, but the movie overall isn't actively terrible. I've seen worse movies, ones where I find entertainment from laughing at how bad they are. But with Borderlands, I was just extremely bored. Not because it's slow, I was bored during actions scenes.I just didn't care. I found myself slouching in my seat, not wanting to be there at all. I checked the time, thinking it was almost over. But we weren't even an hour in. So I did something I almost never do. I walked out at the 1 hour mark.This movie will fail. Hard. Do better.

To those who think Clap trap is annoying in the movie, he is even worse in the video games, it's a horrible character.",

        "body":"When you watch this garbage you have to wonder if it was also massacred as so many other video game franchises by Uwe Boll ... and surprise, surprise, it WASN'T !!Why do I say it's \"garbage\":\nWell, for a start don't call your movie \"Borderlands\" and say it's \"inspired by the game franchise\" when all that was inspired by it is the movie title and you throw around some in-game names. The characters don't feel and sound like the game characters and it seems to be a movie about \"Borderlands 27\" with most of the movie characters being closer to retirement (or past it) rather than being of the age their virtual counterparts are. Who the heck did that casting ??? Ah, yes, it's diverse and mainly female and has plenty of DLC side characters rather than the original main characters. And Tiny Tina in the game is cool, awesome, edgy, brutal, ruthless, a proper girl-boss ... in the movie she's just unfunny and rather pathetic and a somewhat girl-boss not because she deserves it, but because the script tells us she is ... sort of another failed Harley Quinn.Talking about the casting ...\nWhat a waste of Cate \"Galadriel\" Blanchette !! That's all I have to say about her. Same goes for Jamie Lee Curtis ...Kevin Hart is an Eddie Murphy ordered from Wish. Yes, he's black, yes, he does comedy, and no, he's not funny. Actually has never been ... nor edgy. Here again he does a family friendly Jumanji performance and is just, well, the usual unfunny and sometimes even obnoxious Kevin Hart.Claptrap, aka. Jack \"next time don't miss Trump\" Black. I never got the hype around him and now he is just another has-been with serious health and hygiene issues. Play your music, play your roles, but be aware if you also want to be an activist you deter all those who don't agree with your opinion ... which is bad for business.",

The cast is solid, with great performances from Kevin Hart, Cate Blanchett, and Jamie Lee Curtis. It was also a nice surprise to see Bobby Lee bringing his unique charm to the Borderlands universe.While the movie is visually beautiful, the story didn't quite hit the mark for me.

On Pandora, Lilith forms an alliance with a team of misfits: Roland the soldier, the psychotic Krieg and a robot named Claptrap.The hackneyed script is primarily concerned with moving its cast from set piece to set piece, but forgets to build an entertaining team dynamic between the cast. As contrasting and outlandish as the characters seem, their contrasting personalities never clash.Reportedly, one of the screenwriters removed their own credit from the film. I'm sure there's a fascinating story behind that to come.The humor falls completely flat. Move aside, Jar Jar Binks. Jack Black's Claptrap the robot takes the mantle as one of the most annoying movie characters, endlessly misfiring stale one-liners into cricket-filled theater silence.A part of me was waiting for funny zingers from Kevin Hart, but he was playing the straight part in an oddly restrained manner, as if he was directed to just say the lines, and not allowed to improvise.As much as she tries to hold it together, Cate Blanchett falls short of creating an iconic female action lead role. The material is just not giving her enough to build a performance around. Although I'm unfamiliar with the Borderlands games, Blanchett does seem miscast in this part.As a result, I didn't buy into the Borderlands world. This is a barren desert planet with limited resources, yet everything looks so colorful and the people behave so casually. Nobody looks convincingly hungry, desperate or crazy. There's even a shuttle bus service that ferries people around on this planet.Why do we need to care about these people finding this girl on this planet?

My husband wanted more zaniness from Tina, but I thought the actor did a great job of portraying a more realistic version of Tina's particular brand of nutty. Curtis nailed the quirky aloofness of Tannis. Blanchett did a reasonably decent job as Lilith, and still portrays the Power Mommy dynamics that the character requires.

I look forward to each new release and play each class to max level. The humor, chaos, and character personalities are all very entertaining. This travesty ignored everything that makes Borderlands unique and interesting.Clearly this was not made for fans of the series. All I can think is that they toned it down to a PG-13 level with all that implies to try to entice the prepubescent crowd to make some money but based upon all of the empty seats in my local cineplex it didn't work. I read an interview elsewhere where a lady was saying how much her 13 year old daughter loved \"the robot\" and was saying \"I love Claptrap!\" That lady may be in for a shock if she buys a borderlands game. I just hope the economic loss does not delay BL4 and they can get back to providing what their fans actually want.

The story was seriously lacking, and pretty far from the source material. The character development was missing, completely, so we had no emotional draw to anybody. It looks like they tried to make a movie for both an audience that hasn't played the games, and one that has, and by so doing made a mediocre movie. (If you're going to make a great game movie, make it for the people who played the games! They should have at least bought items from vending machines!)There are comments and reviews about Claptrap's humor, some saying his lines are cliché. As a player of the games Claptrap himself was notorious for his horrible sense of humor. Did they execute that well in the movie? That's debatable. A few times I laughed at his humor, a few times I rolled my eyes.The movie is short so it moves pretty quickly, which is good because it keeps things moving, but it's bad because there wasn't enough time for us to get to know the characters. The action scenes were nothing new or impressive but they were still fun because, well, they were actions scenes in a Borderland world. They were not in short supply so if you're looking for an entertaining popcorn movie, but aren't looking for the next great classic, then you'll have fun.

        "body":"This was a movie that I was so looking forward to, but unfortunately there were a lot of red flags with this movie. First off, the marketing was terrible. Then, there were a number of reshoots done behind Eli Roth's back. And finally, Craig Mazin removed his name from the project and that was the last straw for me personally. After watching the movie, I understand why because this movie was a monumental disaster in every way possible.Positives for Borderlands (2024):\nI will say that the cast was clearly having a lot of fun in this movie. There's also some enjoyment in watching a movie that is basically a combination of Star Wars and Mad Max. Unfortunately, that's not the movie we got.Negatives for Borderlands (2024):\nNow here's the thing I don't understand about this movie. Out of all the movie studios to produce this movie, why did it have to be Lionsgate! This production company hasn't been consistent with the project that they've produced whether it comes to movies or tv shows. Also, this movie doesn't feel like an Eli Roth project as it lacks all of the elements from his style of filmmaking and that's coming from someone who literally binged through all of his movies a month ago. The movie isn't Rated-R and that a big problem for me as someone who is getting sick and tired of these generic PG-13 Blockbuster Movies. As much as I do like Jack Black and Ariana Greenbalt as actors, I couldn't stand either of their characters as they were ungodly annoying. This movie also has some of the worst greenscreen backgrounds I've ever seen in my life and I saw Teen Wolf: The Movie (2023) and Expend4bles (2023) last year with the latter also being produced by Lionsgate. It also doesn't help that the Borderlands Games aren't known for being story-based video games, so that makes it a very questionable decision to adapt this video game series. It literally feels like Lionsgate was just making stuff up as they were filming this movie and it feels like they were trying to make their own version of Guardians of the Galaxy, except they are not James Gunn.Overall, Borderlands (2024) is a monumental atrocity against cinema and video game adaptation. I am baffled that Lionsgate was allowed to make this movie and that they dragged Eli Roth into this mess. It literally feels like Eli Roth was put in shackles by the studio which is a big red flag for me. This is one of the worst movies of 2024 and one of the worst video game adaptations of all time.",

Therefore, it's another movie that is welcomed into the group I would call \"video game adaptations that have failed\". Just like the movie adaptations like: Assassins Creed, Rampage and Mortal Combat, they all fall short in performance and story telling. But I would personally say that this movie is the worst of the four.Let's start of with the plot\/story... It comes out blank and boring. The villain(s) ain't that interesting and rememberable, and is just here and there without any big presentation. Besides that, the plot is just slow and full of comedic lines that just end up flat and not that funny. The only fun part of the movie would be ClapTrap, but even he reuses jokes that don't feel original and funny.The cast is full of talent. But it is more like they've been cast for the wrong movie. For instance, Jamie Lee Curtis, she doesn't feel fitted to play a sci-fi version of Sheldon Cooper. Cate Blanchett as Lilith ain't my preferred casting either. But probably the worst choice is Kevin Hart as the mercenary Roland. Kevin Hart, probably one of the funniest people in the world and you cast him to play a serious role... Nah... Ain't good. He just feels out of place. And then, Jack Black voicing ClapTrap, I mean... It was alright.... Probably the only character I found interesting.The music score ain't really anything big just meh...But I do have to give it a thumbs up for trying to make costumes and scenes look real. I did get the sense that they have spend money to make the areas of filming look real and just like the games. So that I do like.But again back to something disappointing... The CGI was very bad at times and maybe alright at other times. But overall it's just another let down.I do feel sad that this movie didn't make the good impression I wished for, but it did give me a feeling of leaving to go home and play the games rather than carrying on watching the movie. So I do recommend playing the games rather than going out to watch this movie. I give the movie an overall rating of 2\/10.",

Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing.

Regardless of whether you're a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up, and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there's the costumes\/armor\/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it's exciting, it has bags of character, it's funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more. Since watching it around Christmas 2001 at a packed out cinema, and the many times I've seen it on DVD since, it never fails to impress and charm.

        "body":"The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.I loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the \"good\" characters, but also with the \"evil\" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can't imagine the movie without him.Some films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.But after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else.The LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!",

        "body":"Breathtaking.  Unique.  Captivating.  Enchanting.Within minutes of the start of this first chapter of an undeniably epic trilogy, the audience was left gasping at the intensity of the images on the screen.  And we had nearly three hours to go.The scope of Tolkien's masterpiece may have eluded film-makers for decades, but director Peter Jackson makes good on his promise: he has not only brought us the tale of Frodo and his bold companions, he has brought us Middle Earth.  And believe me, it is BIG.  Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities and citadels of Tolkien's imagination.But even more impressive than the stunning visuals and sound-effects-like-you've-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters.  Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood's Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I've seen in a long time.  The despair, terror, and determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades.  I left the theater aching...from tensing every muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven't seen since Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D-Day beaches of Normandy.Those unfamiliar with Tolkien's world may quickly find themselves lost in it, but happily so.  The depth of his creation cannot be grasped in a few hours, and it doesn't need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen, and leaves little room for complaint.The movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their seats, feeling somewhat bereft.  We were exhausted, but no one wanted to wait a year for more.Jackson's ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you've seen this year.  George Lucas and Chris Columbus take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise.For everyone else: don't you dare miss it.",

        "body":"Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.Now, several years later after having watched all three of these \"Rings\" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the \"Fellowship\" film.Anyway, \"Fellowship,\" stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.The story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience.",

        "body":"...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've read \"The Lord of the Rings\" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Silmarillion\" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in \"The Hobbit\" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron. Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of 'Fellowship of the Ring' lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I've read a reviewer saying he'd make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with 'Alvin and the Chimpmunks' kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.Ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that's the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried \"ranger\". Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he's willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the 'best friend' everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can't wait for his return.Quite frankly, I can't wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure.",

The first part of the trilogy gets off to a slow start as we meet the characters who will soon become the fellowship. It picks up speed when the faceless, hood-wearing, horsemen come looking for the ring. There are some great action scenes that follow and an exciting cliffhanger at the end. I own this, the Two Towers, and will own Return of the King because they are good movies. But masterpieces they are not. They get slow at times, become cheesy at other times, and the acting is not top of the line. I'd give the whole trilogy a 7 out of 10. No more, no less. 7\/10",

Not fighting action but I mean as in stuff happens because nothing really happens. Its very corny \"You shall not pass!\"so corny. Reminds me of a Dungeons and Dragons meet or something.

        "body":"It is with no surprise that Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring film has received such mixed critics. Many viewers refer to it as being childish, boring and uninteresting. Seems to me that it is bound to the same fate of Tolkien's books, destined to be a target for the same type of misunderstandings that keep attacking this literary masterpiece many decades after it's first publication.Having read the books several years ago, I went to see this `impossible' film when it came out with many doubts on my mind. I really liked it, but left the theater with as many doubts as I had before. Was it perfect? Well, maybe not, but what an achievement. After watching it a few times on DVD, and thinking about it for some time now, I find myself loving this film more and more. Let me tell you why...The Lord of the Rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered, for a very long time, impossible to make, and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed, and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called `Middle Earth'. It's author, Tolkien, dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continent's background, it's mythology and origins, it's different kinds of people, cultures and languages, and therefore it's geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring.Peter Jackson went out to achieve the impossible and came out with a recreation of the original that is pure and true to the story in every detail. The first time the four hobbits meet a black rider on the road, for example, is absolutely faithful to the feeling of the book. The assault of the riders at Weathertop is another great example, and it captures that feeling of danger, density and atmosphere that are the main characteristics of the tale. Jackson also took some liberties with the story, and made some right choices along the way. If the so called `purists' may not approve the removal of Tom Bombadil altogether, it should be comprehensible that the travel from Hobbiton to Rivendel is a very long and detailed one and could easily make a movie on it's own. I felt more uneasy with how short the Council of Elrond was. In the book, the council is where the whole story of the rings is first explained, and many passages from the past ages of Middle Earth are unveiled. It is a fascinating moment of the story, that had to be shortened for obvious reasons. Still, after some consideration, I now agree with the options made by Peter Jackson, and think that the movie prologue narrated by Galadriel was the wisest choice. The magic is all there when Gandalf shuts his eyes the moment Frodo stands in the council and says `I will take the ring'. It is there at Moria's Gate, and at the fall of Boromir. It is a powerful film that doesn't fit the rhythm of the standard Hollywood action movie. It is a film that breeds, that takes time to unfold, it's tale branching in every direction.I could go on and on, talking about all the different elements that bring this film close to perfection, but I'll end saying that deep down, this is not about action, beards and big monsters. The greatest thing about this film, to me, is that it brought me back to a time when I was in love with a different world where everything was possible. Reading The Lord of the Rings night after night, I came to understand what this thing of `mankind' really was all about. The corruption of absolute power, the importance and value of friendship, the inevitability of growing up, the strength of hope... That this film could capture that magic, and be a new bearer to it's message of humanism, is a statement to it's greatness. Gandalf's words, that even the smallest person may change the course of the world, and have a part to play in the destiny of all, are immortal.In the end, this is a wonderful film, but that doesn't mean you are going to like it. I cannot tell you what it is like to see this film if you don't know or love the book. But I hope it may plant a seed on your heart to discover a great world of fantasy, beauty and humanity. I believe Tolkien would have liked that.",

Time, and multiple rewatching as, can cause us to forget how impossible the whole project seemed before the world saw it; we forget how strange and independent spirited parts of it are; we forget the references too and evidence of Jackson's roots in horror cinema; we forget the narrative excitement that propels a film adapted from a source that is more discursive, more of a scene-setter. Changes made from the text aid this, and the result is thrilling and wonder-inducing. It's a masterful piece of epic fantasy cinema, and the whole trilogy's place in my heart is secure.",

        "body":"I think it is important to remember that Peter Jackson took up this film not in order just to make a film of `The Lord of the Rings' but because he wanted to make a 'fantasy just like the `The Lord of the Rings'\" as he himself put it.  After repeating that phrase on a number of occasions the question popped into his mind: \"Well, why not the `The Lord of the Rings' itself?\".  In doing this he, of course, set himself an enormous challenge: he had to make a really good `fantasy' film, one which would stand on its own and be true to what he had originally wanted to do but he would also, and here the task he had set himself was enormous, be true to the original book and to make a film which the legions of people who have loved this book would feel happy with.  In the latter task he was certainly not helped by the author or the book: Tolkein, it would seem, hated cinema.  The book itself is `HUGE': this was not going to be the kind of task that the James Ivory team set themselves, or Scorsese nor the kind of task facing Branagh with Hamlet; nor was it going to be like the puny task that faced Columbus with `Harry Potter' who had the bigger budget ($130 million for one film as compared with Peter Jackson with $300m for three).I have just seen the first `volume' and can say without hesitation that he has succeeded in both his goals.  It is not the book but a reading of the book which is inventive and fascinating.  It is the kind of experience that makes you want to go back and reread the whole thing in the light of the emphases that Jackson has brought to the story.  He focuses on the corrupting influence of the ring and, through this focus, the character of the chief protagonists of the story are revealed.  Clearly those most tempted by it are mortal men (Boromir and even, in one moment, Aragorn), those who already have power (Elrond - `The ring cannot stay here'; Galadriel; Gandalf and Saruman),  and, of course, those who would not normally desire it but who by accident become ring bearers - Gollum, Bilbo, Frodo.  I can see why, in this reading, Jackson decided to leave out the Bombadil episode.  Bombadil, like the Balrog, is beyond the ring but the latter is important to the unfolding of the story of the fates of all the characters, Bombadil isn't.It is a miracle of this reading of the first volume of the book that one can see where Jackson is going and one can get a feel of how the reading is going to unfold.  In a sense, Jackson's real trial - as far as those who know the books are concerned - will come with the second film in the series. He has lived up to our expectation by creating even bigger ones: how can he handle the story of the chase andrescue of Merry and Pippin, the storming of Isengard etc - stories which don't really add much to the core theme that is emerging.  Or is he now going to add the theme of the great contest of good versus evil to the unfolding reading?All of this points to the fact that the film, even though it is a feast of special effects, focuses on character.  And this also explains why Jackson chose the actors he did for their roles: they are not `big' names - no `Sean Connery', no `Alan Rickman', no `Brad Pitt', no `Sam Neill'etc.  He didn't want them getting in the way of the story of character.  Ian McKellan's talents, in particular, are used to tell a large proportion of the story: an enormous amount is conveyed simply through his facial expressions and even by the language of his body. The other miracle in all of this is Elijah Wood.  Like many others, when I first heard of Jackson's choice, I groaned: but Wood has been extraordinary.  He brings, as one friend said, a strange kind of androgyny to the role and this is just perfect. McKellan has already been knighted: give Wood the Oscar.And then there is Middle Earth: this is, as someone put it, another character in the story and the New Zealand landscape, digitally enhanced on occasion, lives up to its role too.Enough.  See this film!  Greatest film ever made?  How can one make a claim like that! Silly really; as silly as claiming that `The Lord of the Rings' is the greatest book ever written.  Can't one simply love a story, enjoy reading it a number of times amd lose oneself in it.  One CAN claim that it is the greatest work in its genre as is the film.10\/10",

        "body":"Star Wars has been dethroned.  Although George Lucas' movies are good in their own right (except for the juvenile elements he puts in to sell toys to finance the franchise), his scripts (which borrow heavily from J.R.R.Tolkien, mythology & religion) can't compare with the brilliance of the literary trilogy `The Lord of the Rings'.  Granted, Lucas took on a herculean task in writing & directing his story himself, but Tolkien's words, along with Peter Jackson's faithful adaptation & inspired vision, have created something no one man could equal. Of course, it helps that Jackson insisted on at least a 2 picture deal, & New Line Cinema was brave enough to foot the bill up front for 3 movies. They spent $180 million to film all 3 simultaneously.  With the New Zealand exchange rate, that equals $360 million ($90 million ea.), but since they used many of the same sets, and FX development costs were spread throughout, we're seeing $120-$150 million on the screen.  This will ensure consistency in plot, casting, tone, etc.In 3 hours, Jackson has crammed everything essential from the first novel & then some into the film, rewriting some scenes & dialogue with lesser characters for the leads, leaving out only what there wasn't enough time for.  Basically, you have two 90 min. movies running back to back.  There are no slow spots, just one climax after another.  From the opening 10 min. backstory where the Dark Lord Sauron is shown on the battlefield wiping out men & elves 10 at a time with each swing of his mace, I was blown away.  The romance between Aragorn, king in exile, and Arwen, daughter of the elf-lord, is played up for the \"Titanic\" quotient, but it's well done. The story, sets, costumes & FX are so rich, you'll have to see the film several times to absorb everything.  The unspoiled New Zealand locales are spectacular, providing a variety of environments to represent the different settings on the characters' journey.  The location sets are imaginative, detailed & weathered, adding to their believability, while the studio sets match them in meticulousness.  The costumes are at once familiar & strange, drawing on both the medievil & the fantastic, but more important, they're also functional & practical.  The music by Howard Shore is appropriately sweeping, Celtic & folky in keeping with the novel, although it lacks the memorable themes of John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith, but neither would commit a year or more to a 3 picture project.  The FX are as they should be, unobtrusive & unnoticed most of the time, there only to support the story not draw attention away from it as in most Hollywood movies which try to coverup illogical plots & bad acting. I'm particularly gratified by the casting of Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn which was a last minute stroke of luck when the actor first chosen for the part backed out due to differences with the director.  I've always thought Mortenson had an intensity & striking but not pretty-boy looks that could portray a flawed, dangerous hero instead of the villains Hollywood always picked him for.A stellar cast giving some of their best performances, visuals that deliver beyond what I imagined, a perfect mix of humor, passion & tragedy, and a feeling of grandeur, scope & impending doom.  Perhaps as an ensemble piece with so many characters & the inability to concentrate on any one, it can't be measured against some of the classic character study films, but even the casual moviegoer can grasp the ideas & not get lost  As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the greatest films of all time.",

        "body":"I had begun watching The Lord of the Rings because of all the memes and references in other movies and shows. And that was probably an excellent decision. It has been a year since I have watched these and since the story is distributed among all the three movies, I have decided that I will talk about something unique each of them. In total these movies clock over 10 hours, and I can imagine how much the fans of the book must have loved it when they learnt they are getting so much content from a book they love reading so much.The Fellowship of the Ring is the very first one of the movies which basically kickstarts the adventure. It is amazing to see how much content this movie has in spite of the fact that the entire backstory was narrated in the first two minutes of the beginning. There are a lot of things to talk about in this. The movie created a font style, a score and a colour palette that fits along with the scenes of the battle that made it look so suspenseful. As the scene was going on I was very attentive to hear everything that happens throughout. And this was just the first two minutes of the 3 hour movie.Afterwards the scene transitioned to the otherwise peaceful Hobbiton. It was a very interesting transition, that showed how on one hand the races are fighting each other for getting control over the Middle Earth, while on the other hand there are a bunch of peace loving Hobbits who are just into their day to day lives. They always have very wholesome reactions when they see Gandalf, which is the reason why it creates a stark contrast from what is about to happen after they leave Hobbiton. Although Bilbo was a good friend of Gandalf and Gandalf had come all the way to celebrate his birthday, he didn't feel that Bilbo was a trustworthy person because he was also attached to the ring. As a result he decided to send his nephew Frodo, his friend Sam and two other Hobbits to help dispose of the ring.The ring is also something I'd like to talk about here, since it is in this movie that the ring and its effects have been talked about the most. The ring is something that appeals to anyone who has desires, but once it is worn it ends up tormenting the wearer. The subtle message that this sends us is the consequence of a moment's greed. Not everyone has the ability to hold their temptation, which is the reason why the Hobbits are specifically sent to dispose of it. Frodo himself has the urge to wear it twice, the reason being that he wanted to save himself. At one moment he wears it accidentally during a bar fight, which makes him see the Eye of Modor and makes him vulnerable. If one is able to get over their desires and focus on what makes their life easy, there will be no need of such temptations. This is what the ring tells us.And afterwards they go to Rivendell, which is, simply said, the most beautiful place I have ever seen in my whole life in any movie! Over there they create The Fellowship of the Ring, which goes to destroy the ring in the lava at the Mountain of Doom. Now I won't get too much into the story since I want to keep this review spoiler-free, so I'm just gonna talk about how beautiful all the scenes from this movie are. Seeing them reminded me of my childhood, reading nursery rhymes and fairy tales. I always looked at the pictures and imagined this is what those places must have looked like. Every location from this movie looks like it could be one of those 19th century paintings. It's amazing to see such places are still left in this world that have not been destroyed as of yet.The movie, or should I say the trilogy, has really gone hard with the details. They chose to make the maps, the fonts, the detailed lore, all the cities from the Middle Earth and even the easter eggs which added a lot of lore to the movie. Every scene from the movie looks like a painting, which is not something which can be said about most adventure fantasy movies. It has the feeling of an RPG game to it, or at least that's how I feel it. It's something of a Skyrim of all movies. For the fans this must have felt like a dream coming true. Things like these should be made for all fantasy movies, which have begun looking underworked simply because of the existence of this movie.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is not a movie that I may want to watch again because of how long it was and the fact that it is nothing in itself unless the other two parts are also combined, but this is also for a good thing because of the fond memories that this movie has left for me. Personally this was the most memorable movie for me among the trilogy. It was because of how rich and detailed this movie was that gave me the confidence of watching the other two movies as well, something I rarely do otherwise. There are many iconic movies like The Godfather, Jurassic Park and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs which I did like, but they didn't give me the courage to continue. This is going to be one of those classical movies that I'd remember for life.",

Tolkien's first LORD OF THE RINGS installment detailing how well-meaning young hobbit Wood unwittingly inherits a ring from his adventurous uncle Holm which possesses a dark force that is powerful enough to end all life in Middle-Earth. Visually wondrous even for those who aren't that into the fantasy genre. This installment is particularly charming for less action and more character development and, for some reason, the Middle-Earth lingo works really well in this movie over the second and third films. Although FELLOWSHIP merely teases the viewer with the appearance of Gollum—while TWO TOWERS and RETURN are basically owned by Serkis as Tolkien's timelessly wretched creature who's not quite friend or foe—the movie is just too lovable to really even need his inclusion. McKellen is perfect as Gandalf the Grey, and Bean's performance brings to the foreground the genius of all these characters who suffers from similar temptations and weaknesses that we do in reality. It is FELLOWSHIP that holds the clearest mirror up to us, while the following two films kind of just linger in the wartime aftermath. The greatest fantasy film of all-time.**** (out of four)",

But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing \"The Lord of the Rings\" films. \"The Lord of the Rings\" is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the \"PG-13\" rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get \"into\" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and \"The Enemy,\" who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live (\"live\" is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a \"fellowship of the ring.\" There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called \"The Lord of the Rings\" the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right.10\/10",

        "body":"Peter Jackson set out to make movies which the author of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien would have endorsed. All three were resounding successes, though because of the film medium they necessarily varied from Tolkien's story-line. Purists may have issues with Jackson's theatrical license, but as someone who has read Tolkien's books several times and seen the films 4-5 times each, I never felt that Jackson went too far or compromised Tolkien's story, the mythology he developed or the wonderful characters he brought to life. Many have said what Jackson did could not be done. He has not only proved the nay-sayers wrong, but lovingly crafted a set of films which will, for many decades to come, stand out as a great achievement. This is the first of three reviews I am publishing on IMDb for these films. I am labeling them Parts 1, 2, and 3 just in case anybody wants to read them in order. The reviews will be self-contained, but will also be enhanced by a chronological reading. My reviews will focus on the extended edition DVDs, though my comments are also relevant to the theatrical releases.The Fellowship of the Ring introduces the key characters and the broad story arc of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Wizard Gandalf the Grey travels to a small town for small people (Hobbits)to help celebrate Bilbo Baggins' birthday. The very elderly Baggins doesn't look a day over 45, and soon it becomes apparent why. Since the great adventure of his life, a quest he was sent on by Gandalf himself, he has possessed the most powerful object in all of Middle Earth  The One Ring. This ring is evil incarnate, with an insatiable lust for power, it taints every creature who possesses it and tries to work its way back to its creator  Dark Lord Sauron. Bilbo uses the ring to disappear, as he intends to spend his senescence with his friends the Elves in Rivendell. But activating the ring, he draws the attention of Lord Sauron from thousands of miles away in the land of Mordor. Realizing what has occurred, Gandalf scrambles to determine a course of action and recruits Bilbo's nephew Frodo and his loyal gardener Samwise to bear the ring to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell. Thusly, the seeds of the fellowship are planted in the soil of the Shire.At this point, we are about 1\/6th of the way through The Fellowship. Fairly soon thereafter, it becomes clear who will compose the fellowship, and who and what these people are. Though the succeeding films are not entitled \"Fellowship\", they follow the adventures of the surviving central characters. Characterization is done just as Tolkien did it in the original novel  by example not discourse. For example, we are given hints to the identity of Strider (Mortenson) earlier on in the movie than in the novel, but the actual significance of this remains ambiguous until about midway through. Strong characterization is key to the success of the entire trilogy. To summarize, Peter Jackson, his team and cast  NAIL the characterization. The casting and acting is perfect. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to single out Mortenson and McKellen for carrying their difficult roles so well (Strider\/Aragorn and Gandalf), but why risk diminishing the contributions of the rest of the cast? Nobody mis-steps, and it is clear from the beginning that the entire cast was thoroughly and completed engaged with the task before them.Tolkien believed that no film would ever do his work justice, and until this trilogy, he was correct.Peter Jackson and his team have managed to do exactly what they set out to. As Jackson himself has said in reference to the film trilogy, they set out to 'make Tolkien's film.' Jackson successfully drew out elements of all three books, expanding and contracting, rearranging, and sometimes adding whole subplots which are hinted at in the books, but not well explained, in order to adopt the grand story to the film medium. Arwen (Liv Tyler), daughter of Elrond and Elven lover of Aragorn, for example, is introduced early in the films and plays a role in the films which is much more equal to her significance than it was in the books.The Howard Shore score is lovely, and its simple themes are used to great effect throughout all three movies. The musical collaborations improvising on Shore's basic themes are great, and, though they feature some prominent performers  are never weighed down by star-power.Jackson made all three movies simultaneously. This technique allowed for perfect continuity, and permitted much greater flexibility in editing and post-production work than would normally be allowed. Knowing that he would need to establish and support his own fellowship to make this production work, he also knew that success would make the production legendary. So, he documented the creation of the films beautifully. Two complete DVDs full of documentary pieces are included in all three Special Edition Packages in the trilogy. Many are likely to be bored by the details in these documentaries, but those interested in the creative process behind the films will be provided with a more comprehensive view than I can remember ever seeing in any similar DVD package. The Fellowship of the Rings is as true a representation of Tolkien's novel as can be imagined. Although some aspects of the stories in the novel were adapted to the screen, the essentials, the characters, and the overall story are not just recognizable, but ENHANCED by the film. What results is a film that is not just entertaining, but an enormous fulfillment of an undying wish of millions of fans around the world.Very highly recommended.",

        "body":"Sixty years ago, the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins came into possession of a magic ring. When he decides to leave his home in the Shire and retire, he finds it curiously difficult to leave the ring behind. Disturbed, the wizard Gandalf investigates and discovers that Bilbo's trinket is actually the One Ring of legend, which the Dark Lord Sauron needs to complete his return to power. Bilbo's cousin Frodo has to take the Ring on a long and arduous journey across Middle-earth to the volcano known as Mount Doom, deep within Sauron's land of Mordor, the only place where it can be destroyed.Back in 1999, when Peter Jackson began filming The Lord of the Rings, there was an expectation of failure. A thousand-page-long book adapted into three three-hour movies by a director whose biggest previous movie had been a minor ghost comedy starring Michael J. Fox? And on a budget of only $90 million apiece at a time when $200 million+ budgets for such epic films were becoming more commonplace? It seemed like a recipe for disaster.Against the odds, Jackson pulled it off. The trilogy as a whole is a remarkable work, translating Tolkien's vision onto the screen with - for the most part - respect and integrity. There are missteps, mistakes and some ill-conceived changes, but these are mostly restricted to the second and third films in the sequence. The Fellowship of the Ring, on the other hand, is moved from page to screen with enviable skill.The main key to the film's success is the casting. Elijah Wood may be a lot younger than Frodo in the novel, but he sells Frodo's mix of book- learned wisdom with a lack of practical experience with wide-eyed enthusiasm. Representing the old guard, veteran actors Ian McKellen, Ian Holm and Christopher Lee bring their roles of Gandalf, Bilbo and Saruman to life with presence and gravitas. The actors are pretty much all excellent, even Cate Blanchett as she struggles with a curiously-written interpretation of Galadriel. Marton Csokas is probably the film's weakest acting link as Celeborn, but given he has about twenty seconds of screen time, this is not a major issue. I must also admit to not being altogether convinced by Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn the King, but as Strider the Ranger in this first film he is superb.In terms of scripting and changes from the books, some key sequences are missing. Tom Bombadil is gone (which is a wise move), as are the barrow- wights (which is more regrettable) and other elements are compressed (the journey from the Shire to Bree, which covers dozens of pages in the book, happens instantly on-screen) or eliminated altogether (Fatty Bolger, the 'Fifth Hobbit', is exorcised from events). Other events that happened in the book off-page or only in flashback occur here in their correct chronological order, such as Saruman's confrontation with Gandalf at Isengard.For the most past these changes are well-judged, even if some fan- favourite moments are left out. For a three-hour movie the pacing is generally excellent, with a good mix of exposition, character-building moments and action set pieces. The movie's effects are impressive, with CGI being held back and used only when absolutely necessary, with miniatures often employed to give physical locations a sense of presence and weight. Whilst clearly resulting from budgetary restrictions, this prevents the film getting buried under fake-looking CGI and means it still has more convincing effects than the recent first Hobbit movie, which feels a little silly.It's difficult to pick a stand-out moment from the film. The Black Riders pursuing the Hobbits is an evocative moment, as is the confrontation on Weathertop and the flooding at the Fords of Bruinen. The outstanding sequence is probably the descent through Moria, which features both excellent character moments (such as Gandalf's conversation with Frodo when they discover that Gollum is pursuing them), humour (Pippin's encounter with a skeleton on a well), action (the battle with the cave troll in the chamber of Mazarbul) and tragic horror (Gandalf's last stand on the bridge of Khazad-dumb). The whole sequence is a joy to watch.The film missteps a little near the end: the trip to Lorien, where the Fellowship regroups after Moria, made sense in the book but in the film it dangerously comes close to killing the pace of the movie altogether. This is not helped by the somewhat bizarre characterisation of Galadriel. Jackson is to be commended for trying to make the longueur work, but ultimately it feels like it's delaying the film's climax too much at the moment it should be ramping up towards it. Fortunately, in the cinematic edition it's a fairly brief sequence. Events culminate in the epic battle on Amon Hen, with Sean Bean delivering a stand-out performance during Boromir's last stand and Sean Astin's Sam getting his first notable moments in the film's cliffhanger ending.The movie's success is furthered by some truly remarkable production design and the quite astonishing soundtrack by Howard Shore, which must rank as one of the finest movie soundtracks of all time.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring remains, thirteen years on, one the finest fantasy movies ever made. The writing, acting and effects work all combine and work in tandem with one another to produce something very special, something that Peter Jackson has struggled to replicate ever since.",

        "body":"Lord of The Rings is, to me, the industry standard for fantasy films. That being said, it doesn't particularly resonate with me personally. Despite the strongly communicated themes of the virtues of bravery and fellowship, the downfall of this film (and book it's based off) is its worldbuilding. LOTR makes use of \"hard world building\", the narrator (or in this case the director) is very explicit in their worldbuilding, you directly see their vision through the inclusion of many details and direct explanations of events, characters, and places. LOTR uses this to great success, sadly it just doesn't resonate that well with me. I prefer the opposite, \"soft worldbuilding\", implicitly building the world leaving more up to interpretation. I don't mean to say that soft worldbuilding is objectively better, it's just my preference. This is why Lord of The Rings isn't really my type of movie, despite this I still think it's objectively good, the cinematics shine through here, the use of wide shots really encapsulates the scope of the world that this story takes place in, something I did really appreciate. The characters are also great, so all in all I do really think this movie set the bar for fantasy films in Hollywood. But again, it just doesn't really appeal to my preferences.",

        "body":"I was taken to a midnight showing of the first Lord of the Rings movie. Like having sex for 3 hours with no orgasm I was completely disappointed. The movie was eye candy to behold.  The scenery and the amazing special affects were stunning.  I have not read the books, and frankly, I don't want to now.  I was so bored.  I almost began to cry.  I felt trapped in a movie which went from one foe to the next...to the next....to the next....to the next.....to the next....to the next.....to the next....and on and on and on, so long that when the main character noted \"I wish the ring had never found me,\" I agreed.  As the movie progressed different foes and challenges popped up as though they just magically appeared--Oh look we are stuck in these frigid mountains, no where to go.......it is OH so cold....what do we do? Oh, I know, lets take these mines here that just conveniently randomly appeared!  If you've read the books, you might enjoy the closeness, as I hear it has.  However, if you haven't...don't bother.

        "body":"When I first saw the trailers for \"The Fellowship of the Ring,\" I had never had any interest in reading the lengthy tome of a trilogy.  But seeing the possibility of the movie, I immediately went out and read the whole thing, insisted on receiving it for Christmas, and enjoyed every minute of it. The feelings I had while reading the series were heightened seeing it come to life in the stunning movie.  I thought it was a fabulous work of art.I thought that having Galadriel tell what was basically the prologue of the book was a good idea, as it helped those who had never read the story.  It also immediately involved me in the film; I felt I had an insider's advantage on the rest of the audience.  Cate Blanchett has a wonderfully deep and emotional voice; the way she speaks Galadriel is almost as effective as her appearence as the Elven queen.  Also, showing the last battle of Isildur and Sauron helped unfog a part of the novel that had me a trifle confused.The entire movie is full of beautiful sets and landscapes.  The Shire was almost exactly as I'd pictured it.  Hobbiton is cute and very whimsical. Mordor was frighteningly well done, extremely real.  Rivendell had a little bit of a European-tourist-trap look, but was beautiful all the same.  The entire backdrop of the movie (the mountains, Moria, Isengard) was perfect; it's amazing that \"Fellowship\" was filmed in one country.Now to the characters.  All I can say is, \"Wow.\"  I was a little apprehensive about the casting at first; I'd created such real images of the characters in my imagination, I almost didn't want them spoiled for me. However, I was not disapointed in the least.  Elijah Wood, though not one of my favorite actors, was believable.  You could tell from the first glimpse that Frodo was special; Wood's pale, sharp features contrast sharply with the more ruddy, robust look of the rest of the hobbits.  He also cries like a little girl.  But his weaknesses and strengths make his Frodo an apt choice for the starring character.  The rest of the Hobbiton gang was well-chosen, too.  Sean Astin (\"Rudy\" forever to me) was loyal and a bit bumbling, just like the Gamgee of Tolkien's telling.  Pippin and Merry were congenial, slow-witted lads, but very brave nonetheless.  Viggo Mortensen is outstanding.  He has the ability to make Aragorn both menacing and kind. He physically represents Strider to the nines with his strength and virility; the action sequences of his are very passionate and exciting.  Some may have complained about Arwen's character being slightly expanded; I thought it a good change.  In the books, you have to read the whole trilogy and then rifle through the appendix in \"The Return of the King\" to learn the history between Aragorn and Arwen.  Liv Tyler is ethereal and breathtaking, but at the same time displays the courage and magic that make the Elves the beings they are.  Speaking of Elves, I can't help but gush over the handsome and ever-so-talented Orlando Bloom as noble Legolas.  Bloom captured the archer's very movements; he treads lightly and fights fearlessly. Legolas's bowmanship was amazing; he looked so natural loosing his arrows machine-gun style.  He was my favorite character in the books, and his essence transcends the film.  Gimli was pompous and brave, as well.  He is well-represented in the movie.  Boromir was hopelessly lost, but at the same time valiant and strong.  Sean Bean gave an emotionally-charged performance as the tortured warrior.  Hugo Weaving was very good as Elrond.  He was noble and cold at the same time.  And Gandalf.  What more can be said of Ian McKellan's showcase portrayal of the wizard?  He was magnificent.  He could be Gandalf, the kind old conjurer who set off pyrotechnics for hobbit-children.  Then he could turn around and stun the life out of you with Gandalf the powerful wizard, facing the balrog with defiance and an iron will.  His Oscar nomination is well-deserved.Peter Jackson is a brave soul to take on a project that could have backfired in so many places.  Instead of bringing us uninspired kitsch, he serves up raw emotion, graphic battles of good and evil, chilling and wonderful characters, and enough special effects (realistic, mind you) to make John Cameron's mouth water.  Knowing that \"The Two Towers\" was my favorite of the books, I eagerly anticipate the second helping of \"The Lord of the Rings.\"",

        "body":"There is very little that can be said about The Lord of the Rings that hasn't been said already many times over. But what can be re-iterated is that The Fellowship of the Ring is an outstanding piece of film-making.Where do you start when reviewing a film the size of Lord of the Rings? J.R.R. Tolkein's seminal masterwork, long considered unfilmable, has made it on to the screen thanks to visionary director Peter Jackson. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of the three books of the trilogy. Everyone has their favourite of the three, and this one is probably mine. Unrivalled in its size and scale by virtually any other film, with new groundbreaking special and digital effects, a stunning musical score, universally superb acting and most importantly a superb story.The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of the epic trilogy that tells of the quest of a hobbit to destroy an evil ring of power. He is aided in his quest by his friends and other companions who accompany him and protect him on his journey. Many threats face him on his long journey, both from the world around him and from his companions, who could be tempted by the power of the ring he has set out to destroy. It is a tale of magic and fantasy, swords and sorcery, but it is not simply for teens who enjoy dungeons and dragons games. It is accessible to everyone. By turns exciting, frightening, funny and sad, it is a true masterpiece in terms of storytelling, encompassing the full spectrum of emotions.The acting is superb from the entire cast, and it is unfathomable as to how the Academy overlooked the acting entirely for all three films when dishing out awards and nominations. However the performances from Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Elijah Wood and Sean Bean are all so good it would have possibly been greatly unfair to single any one out for an award.The film also contains some groundbreaking computer-generated special effects, and some positively genius scale work. Due to hobbits being only about 3 feet tall, some clever scale work was needed in order to ensure that John Rhys-Davies, a dwarf in the film but over 6 feet tall in real life, did in fact look the height of a dwarf. This was done through clever use of forced perspectives, scale doubles, giant sets and blue screen filming. However, the most impressive use of computer effects lies later in the trilogy, with the appearance of Gollum  cinema's first live-action character who is completely computer generated. The music is also beautiful, and Howard Shore has created possibly the most iconic and memorable score since John Williams' Star Wars.Peter Jackson has, until Lord of the Rings, been seen as a director outside of the mainstream, but his superb, career-defining work on the Lord of the Rings trilogy has seen him well and truly propelled him to the forefront of Hollywood. He has re-defined the epic film with unparalleled success, and created films that will definitely stand the test of time, to one day be thought of with the same reverence as the Star Wars and Godfather trilogies.A major milestone in cinema history, the trilogy would eventually gain seventeen Oscars between the three films. Lord of the Rings is a master class in storytelling, and essential viewing.",

But most of all, it is a dazzling visual marvel.Whether outdoors--scenes of forests and trees, valleys, streams, mountains--or in caves and the like, the visuals are superb.  Color, design, intricacy, detail, contrasts.  The backdrops are excellent.  There are battles with monsters and things like that, but the special effects are not overdone or pompous--they work very well.  A key for me here was not too much sped up action to create excess and pomposity and to have a hard time following what is going on, like in sci fi space battles or the Mummy movies or flicks like that.  Indeed, not only the pace of the plot, but the action, has economy.  In the outdoors, the backdrops are very pretty but for the most part realistic, but in the caves things are done up, with somewhat exaggerated or surreal colors, designs, effects.However, there are other movies with good visuals, even tho it is difficult to think of ones that outdo this.  But what sticks out most, in my mind? Not specifically the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph, but the LIGHTING.  Yes, that overlaps with the other things--backdrop, colors, etc., but it is particularly this item and the obvious sophistication and care that went into it, and the resulting artistic brilliance and beauty, that make the visuals, the cinematography, so excellent in my mind.  Whether indoors or outdoors, the lighting effects, the beauty, blending, and contrasts, are the highlight of the film.10 out of 10.",

Unlike Harry Potter, whose scenes were completely stripped from the book and had no imagination of its own (not to mention details that were changed for no good reason), this work not only has a soul of its own, but manages to keep with Tolkien's original work...  I love this film! Tis Brilliance!\nA word on Casting: perfect. My only qualm is that Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) was a little iffy.  Tolkien makes it a very clear that there is no evil in Galadriel or Lothlorien, but the audience never really gets this as we are all wondering if her skin is going to shed violently to reveal a hideous monster in the service of Sauron.  Nothing to depreciate the value that is this film though.  The emotional range is perfect, the quirkiness of the hobbits is perfect, the cast of characters is perfect... I LOVE YOU PETER! Now it is up to them not to ruin the next two.  As Peter has done so well with the first one, however, I don't see how he or his writing team could. 10\/10",

        "body":"Based on the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien and directed by Peter Jackson, this is the first film in the trilogy \"The Lord of the Rings,\" one of the most striking and most profitable in recent cinema. The film is set in an imaginary world, Middle Earth, where humans coexist with fantastic creatures such as elves, dwarfs, orcs's hobbit's etc. In this film, the balance of this illusory world is at stake because of the war against the evil lord Sauron, who eagerly wants to dominate, corrupt and submit all forms of life. In the midst of these events, two hobbit's living in the Shire, a little-known part of Middle Earth, have the difficult task of hiding the weapon that can decide the course of the war: a ring that gives power to Sauron and he desperately seeks to recover.Everything in this film, a contemporary epic, is perfect: the stunning scenery in New Zealand are breathtaking, the costumes were meticulously designed, the characterization is the top current range in film and computerized animations have been widely used to obtain scenes truly spectacular. The cast, in turn, is luxurious: in this film we have Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd (respectively, in the roles of the four hobbit's Frodo, Sam, Merrin and Pippin), Christopher Lee (as Saruman the magician), Sir Ian McKellen (as the Galdalf wizard the Grey), Cate Blanchett (as Lady Galadriel), Viggo Mortensen (as the walker Aragorn), Orlando Bloom (as the elven archer Legolas) and John Rhys-Davies ( as the dwarf warrior Gimli) and other very talented actors who gave the best of themselves to honor the audience with a movie luxuriously well done.It's not by chance that this movie, as well as the rest of the trilogy, had the impact it had. This is one of the most popular and profitable films of the century, maybe one of the best movies ever, marking the opening of the public to a new generation of epic films. There is only one mandatory film for any movie buff but one of the movies that few people could not see.",

The scenery, props, casting, makeup, and effects all seemed beautifully authentic. And in action, they deliver. But the script (it's always a danger when you see three writers and one of them is the director) spoils the magic.It's more than making Arwen's role more significant (and a completely different character) in a blatant attempt to beef up the roles for women. I didn't like that, but women's roles are admittedly sadly lacking in the original story. It's that Jackson puts his clumsy fingerprints all over Tolkien's themes and tells the story from the perspective of Men. Apparently, modern moviegoers need to identify with their race. (Side note: all the critics who say how the movie has preserved the magic of the books probably haven't read them since college.)The relationship between the four hobbits isn't set up at all in the movie; aside from Frodo the other three hobbits seem thrown into the quest by chance. Rather than being a reluctant, conflicted hero, Frodo is praised by all the other characters but actually does little but squeal, get stabbed, and look on the elves in wonder. Saruman (a lesser character in the fiction who only appears the first book through Gandalf's recollection) takes up far too much time in the movie. And by the end we've seen Sauron's eye so much I wonder there's anything to reveal of the dark lord in the second and third movies. I expected changes, but I fail to see the rationale for many of Jackson's edits--they don't make the story better or the action flow more smoothly.The Lord of the Rings is an elegiac tale of the passing of magic from the world and of the heroic struggles of those races passing from the world to preserve goodness. In Jackson's eyes, history is told from the perspective of the victors, the Men. Hobbits, who drive the action in the books, are along for the ride while Aragorn, Boromir, et al are the real protagonists in the movie.I give Jackson full credit for taking on a task of this scale and achieving an epic feel. If only he'd started with a script as good as his scenery.",

The cinematography is breathtaking (albeit it actually mostly computer generated), the makeup is admirable and some of the set design is really good, but yet in terms of screenplay it ultimately dull. Converting the first part of 'The Lord of the Rings' fantasy novel into a film seemed to be an impossible feat at the time of the film's production, as the books were full of so many essential details that they would not be satisfying without all the content. Nevertheless the producers went ahead, trimming things here and there, creating overall a good-looking film but one in which the events are unclear and the plot is too convoluted to be understood by anyone not familiar with Tolkein's novel. The concept of character developed is abandoned in the epic swoop of the film, creating a not very involving watch. The film is very lengthy, which should not be a problem in the best of epics, but in this one it just leaves a bad taste, as there is no reason to care what actually happens. The film indeed brews a tendency to bore at times, and the action sequences are not only mindless, but are too violent for younger audiences, which is a shame as the 'The Lord of the Rings' is excellent for enthusiastic young readers. On the other hand, there are a number of positives to the film, as it is technically interesting, but that is not enough to make it a very good watch  at the most it is an above average film, because it has some interesting elements. It is just a shame that the cinematic virtues of the film were not given more justice by the screenplay. The original cut was 270 minutes, and judged on the overkill length of this version, two parts to the film would have perhaps worked better. Or perhaps Tolkein's novels would have been better untouched by live action film.",

Unfortunately, no go. *4 hobbits continue journey with other members of fellowship of ring (Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Sauron) *Encounter danger *One dies *Journey to be continued in next movie Very basic, and I've probably left out a lot, but there you go.I really enjoyed this movie like you wouldn't believe - how DID \"A Beautiful Mind\" beat it? (Mind you, Russell Crowe is a pretty solid actor.) As a fantasy movie it rivals \"Harry Potter\", I loved it that much. (And I LOVED \"Harry Potter\" - especially Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape) All I have left to say is: 2 thumbs up; 10\/10; ***** out of *****.",

        "body":"'The Lord of the Rings' is one of my favorite books, I have read it several times, and remember thinking the last time, about 3 years ago that if I made a film I'd want to make it of this, but wouldn't it be almost impossible. You can then imagine how strong my expectations were when I went to see the eagerly awaited first installment.This film impressed me hugely, more than anything else because of how true it was to my imagination, both in the characters as well as in the effects and setting- a sentiment I have heard consistently from other fans of the books. Elijah Wood brought across the character of Frodo with the kind of haunted, frail courage that Tolkien captures so well in the books. Nor could I find any fault at all with Ian McKellan's Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn, and Sean Bean's Boromir, all of whom I thought were portrayed excellently. I could pick out instances where I did think, 'no, that's not right', however their seldomness in number would only serve to illustrate the excellence of the overall portrayal. One thing that did stand out for me was Cate Blanchett's performance as Galadriel, the part itself became so perfunctory in the film that to me her alternation between benevolent seer, and figure of potential terror seemed little more than a slightly confusing detour with no real connection into the plot other than as a vehicle for a glimpse into the future. But that was it.I thought that the points where Jackson did deviate from the text were completely the correct ones to do so. Shortening the opening Shire scenes and cutting out the whole Tom Bombadil bit was great since frankly they bored me slightly in the book anyway. Also, expanding the role of Arwen was a sensible decision.However this film is by no means above criticism. The dialogue was in my opinion terrible and purely there to drive on the plot. Normally this would ruin a film for me (as in \"The Matrix\"), making it almost intolerable to view, however fortunately here it proves little more than a minor irritation. Also, the film seemed overall to be excessively plot-driven and at times a mad dash from one action scene to another, the characters, for all their truth to the book did seem flat and sometimes little more than stereotypical fantasy characters. This is perhaps my major quarrel with the film- I would have liked these characters to have come alive as people in a way that was made impossible by the sparseness of the script and the rollercoaster nature of the plot. In general the whole film lacked the depth of context that I think distinguishes Tolkien from other fantasy writers. However to have achieved this would have required a very different movie, and you can't fault an action film for being an action film.This movie is undoubtedly not for everyone. A lot of people just don't get fantasy- other than Lord of the Rings, I don't particularly either. However in my opinion Jackson really has made an incredible achievement- his and Tolkien's vision carried through suberbly by a breathtaking setting and stunning special effects, as well as by a cast clearly as enthralled as he was. He has taken on a huge task, and is dealing with it with breathtaking success. Check for other user comments.",

        "body":"I've never been a fan of the sword and sorcery genre . I'm surprised film companies decide to make rubbish like THE BEASTMASTER, HAWK THE SLAYER and RED SONJA but I am aware of the popularity of JRR Tolkien's massive novel LORD OF THE RINGS and of it's popularity , I remember in a survey carried out by a very well known British fantasy\/SF magazine in 1987 Tolkien's book was voted the greatest fantasy novel of all time ( THE STAND by Stephen King was a long way second ) , but it's a novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who - like fans of STAR TREK and STAR WARS - insist on reading subtexts that are just not there . When the THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS shot to number one in the IMDb top 250 films I put the popularity down to obsessed anorakish fans who were going to vote the film a classic no matter what . Stranger still I found groups as diverse as neo Nazis to gays to enviromentalists proclaiming \" This is our film \" so when I finally sat down to watch TFOTR I was expecting only some average entertainment for a non sad person with no political axe to grind . After seeing the film I had to admit THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a masterpiece .Much of the credit must go to the producers . I 've no idea of the politics about bringing the story to the silver screen but I can imagine the Hollywood bigwigs sitting around the commitee table saying \" Give us Tom , give us Nicole , get Harrison , get Leonardo . No limeys . Limeys are slimy . No limey accents . We're Americans , this is our baby \" to which the producers gave a firm and resounding \" No \" . Good for them because the Hollywood treatment would have ruined this film. The cast comprised of well known - but not megastar - actors and unknowns are uniformally excellent even the normally hammy Lee and Rhys Davis and the bland Tyler are good . Also great to see so many Brits playing good guys and having the American actors adopting non specific British accents .The cast do a good jobThe other production values are outstanding . Pride of place goes to Andrew Lesnie's cinematography where the camera sweeps down from the sky into the Orcs underground lair and the camera also shows off the stunning New Zealand landscapes . I'd always believed Scotland had the greatest scenery on Earth but I'm willing to change my mind . The FX are good throughout though perhaps the matte backgrounds and CGI are less impressive in places but they're still a lot better than we've been used to recently . The Orc make up is wonderful and helps them become classic cinema monsters . The only bad point about the Orcs is - Like the stormtroopers in STAR WARS - they're too easy to kill .There are some minor flaws to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS but this is probably down to Tolkien's source novel rather than the film makers . A couple of times the heroes seem set to suffer a resounding defeat when something not obvious at first like flammable villains or a giant eagle saves the day . I guess this is cancelled out by the dangers and adversaries also appearing from nowhere and there's little female perspective in the story for the women in the audience to relate to but come on girls you've got Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean acting all hunky and macho so you can't complain.I see the IMDb reviewers have started a backlash against FOTR like they did with TITANIC and GLADIATOR . They're right about the gawd awful rubbish that is TITANIC but they're wrong about GLADIATOR which is a very good film and even further wrong about THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which is a cinematic masterpiece. Ignore their criticisms . Any film that is praised by people as diverse as fans of the book , people who have never read the book , enviromentalists and cynics like myself is worth your time watching . I'm really looking forward to THE TWO TOWERS",

        "body":"Incredible adaptation of the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien's \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy.  I'm not going to summarize the story--there's way to much going on.  All I'll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting, totally accesible movie.  The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that's to get in the plot) and there's a lot to take in, but I was never confused.  I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.The film looks magical--Middle Earth looks beautifully real.  All the special effects are great (the Ring Wraiths are downright terrifying--as they should be) and the action sequences are among the best I've ever seen--fast, long and breathtaking.  The film is long (2 hrs, 40 min) but the time flies by.  The only problem is that there's so much plot and action going on that you're exhausted by the end--but in a good way.With the exception of Viggo Mortensen (very wooden) all the actors are good--top honors go to Elijah Wood, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler and (especially) Ian McKellan.But the film is VERY violent (despite the PG-13 rating).  It deserves an R--this is NOT one for the kids.  Still, it's the best film of 2001.  SEE IT!!!!",

        "body":"The Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Rings. The first time I saw those letters appear on a trailer while watching Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (in May), I thought it was the most ridiculous title for a movie. The trailer was disgusting-I thought the strange-haired little 'people' (later known as hobbits) were ugly and esoteric. Vaguely, I remember whispering to my best friend at the time, 'Ew...who's going to see THAT? What kind of freak would see a movie with such UGLY people??' Little did I know, I would become obsessed with this 'lurid' movie.About 7 months later, the tickets to 'A Beautiful Mind' were sold out, so I opted to go for LOTR, because nothing else seemed worth my $5.50. The movie astonished me right from the first scene, with the thousands of realistic warriors and beautiful scenery, I was immediately hooked. Throughout the movie, I don't think I blinked once. The characters, the Elvish language, the setting, everything intruiged me. It was artistically and originally beautiful, not at all what I expected. I didn't even notice 3 hours passing by before it ended and I sat dumbstruck in the theater for a while, listening to Enya vocalize 'May It Be.' I walked out of the theater like I walked into a new world.6 more times I saw the Lord of the Rings. I have two copies of the soundtrack (which is also fabulous) and am counting the days until the Two Towers. For anybody who has not seen this incredible movie, I suggest that you run to the nearest Blockbusters and rent it on August 6th, when it'll be released on DVD and VHS. It's almost essential to life. The actors-Elijah Wood, Ian McKellan and Viggo Mortensen-beautifully and acurately protrayed the characters of J.R.R. Tolkien's historic masterpiece, and Peter Jackson stayed true to the novel. I've read the books and became deeply interested in things I never have before, and have looked at things just a bit differently in this world.I highly recommend the Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Rings, to anybody at any age anytime. It is my favorite movie, and I'm not surprised that over 60,000 others voted this movie as worthy of #3 on the spot of the top 250 movies of all time.",

However, I do appreciate a semblance of a storyline. I am told by friends that the reason I didn't enjoy this film was because i haven't read the book, but to me, this is simply not good enough as an explanation. Yes, we all know that this film is an adaptation of a famous book, but shouldn't the aim of the director then be to draw in new fans, as well as bring the book to life for those who have read the book?? I was so disappointed with this - I don't buy into hype, but I did expect a good bit of escapism with this film. Unfortunately, as already mentioned, I failed to find anything that could retain my attention. And, from a person who gets irritated if people so much as sneeze during films: I began a conversation with the person sitting next to me halfway through the film and continued to do so sporadically, whilst simultaneously checking the timer on the DVD player, wondering when my own ordeal would come to an end...I honestly cannot remember how this ends, so no chance of spoilers from me - suffice to say, it doesn't matter in my case, as I have no plans to watch the sequels.",

        "date":"2024-03-09",
        "body":"The \"A Través De Mi Ventana\" trilogy comes to an end with this film that is better than the second installment, but makes almost the same mistakes as the previous film. This movie is also an original story that is not related to the last book in the trilogy and presents many situations without much development. It has a couple of ideas that make the film more interesting, but they haven't been explored in depth or fully explained.It all starts with Raquel, having launched her novel inspired by what she experienced in the first film. That is a clear representation towards Ariana Godoy when she wrote the original novel, since she herself admitted that she was based on a real experience that she had with a neighbor, but she never got to have with him what happened with Raquel and Ares . This quite corroborates the hypothesis that Wattpad novels are an explicit reflection of the authors' fantasies and dreams and they live them through an alter ego who is the protagonist of the story. Normally, many of us tend to express our dreams, desires and fantasies through writing and what Godoy did in her book is totally valid, no matter how questionable it may be. Although many say that Ariana and other Wattpad authors are not real writers, there is no denying the fact that some of them have been university students who at least know a little about literature. Godoy's own biography corroborates that she has studied at the university and has even been a teacher. If there is something that the Wattpad stories have made clear, it is that today you can be a writer without having to have studied. It is thanks to social networks that they have now given us free rein to be any type of popular figure without the need to have had prior knowledge about any subject. That is neither a good nor a bad thing. It is something totally neutral and valid.Ares now has a problem regarding Raquel and that is that now he must maintain a commitment to Vera for a family business matter. This is the case where a couple must commit to being united for the economic good of both families. That's the most interesting conflict this movie has, although there was a lot that needed to be detailed. Among other conflicts involving the Hidalgo brothers, Artemis is about to become a father and there is the question of whether he will be able to be a good father because his own father never taught him what paternal love is. There is also the secret affair that Apolo begins to have with another boy and that worries Daniela, although it is a bit absurd for her to worry about it, since she had an affair with another girl in the presence of Apolo. Logically, if Daniela could be with another person in the middle of her relationship with Apolo, then Apolo also had every right to see someone else. These subplots occurring with Apollo and Artemis could have contributed quite a bit to the plot, but it's a shame they didn't delve deeper. Anna is almost invisible in the film and like in the second, she is only there to lead to what happens at the end.It is curious that they have decided that the plot takes place at Christmas and the end of the year, as if it were a symbolism about how Rachel and Ares' stage in the trilogy ends to begin a new stage. What can be seen is that the film is the least cliché of the trilogy, with a more realistic approach oriented towards the characters' emotions. Taking into account the target audience for Wattpad stories, the film may be pleasing for its drama, but not so pleasing for not having the level of youthful clichés that make Wattpad stories so popular. You could say that clichés are the essence of Wattpad stories and are what their audience always expects to see. Ariana Godoy participated again as a consultant and this time she managed to contribute something because the film has something of her feel. This could have been the best film of the trilogy, but it is not due to the lack of structure in the script. Nothing more was needed to better coordinate the ideas and subplots. Although much of the film feels quite average, the best thing is the ending that manages to give a very good conclusion to the story arc of Rachel and Ares. There are still more loose ends to tie up, but it is clear that for fans of this work, only Raquel and Ares matter, not the others.In conclusion, \"A Través De Tu Mirada\" is not that different from the second film because both were made just to replicate the success of the first film, but at least it gives a good ending to the love story of Raquel and Ares. The toxicity that many accused the novel and the first film of does not exist in this latest installment and that at least gives Raquel and Ares that ending that many young girls dream of. If it had had a better structure and more development, it would have been a great film. My final rating for this movie is a 6\/10.",

You can try it.

Many scenes and narrative threads are not finished or have no purpose, as I said, done just to fill time. It is also noticeable how certain mandatory topics are introduced in cinematography such as gay relationships, but which in my opinion had no place in the current story because, apart from a few sexual shots, they fail to convey absolutely any message. It feels like the director and the production had a list of what they had to defend in a modern screening that would catch all categories and they said let's put everything in but without following a logic or without showing a story or useful information .Unfortunately, the story does not come with a new plot, it is full of clichés and the ending is totally predictable.",

I don't mind the clichés, besides that's what you watch romance for. The director's work is remarkable, the acting is more than adequate, the chemistry between the leads is undeniable, so much that you'd think they are a couple in real life. Some scenes could be omitted and I didn't like the way Claudia's role developed, but that's trivial. My measure of how much I appreciated a movie is whether I'd rewatch and it is an absolute yes! Don't be put off by overdemanding viewers, just enjoy!",

The third act feels very disconnected from the rest of the film, culminating in a never-ending finale with bland characters that are poorly developed.The story veered into many different directions, making it feel unfocused.

However, once events leave the arena the movie absolutely bombs its way to the finish. The last portion of the film is terrible viewing, it felt like it just kept going and going and going.There are plot holes aplenty, nonsensical 'twists' and character decisions\/abilities. Cooper, played finely to be fair by Josh Hartnett, is absolutely some sort of big shot in his 'line of work', though makes some dumb mistakes. Though he is apparently capable of teleportation, based on one scene involving a limo.I'm not someone who needs every inch of a movie to make sense, I can enjoy something that's simply an entertaining watch; even with poorly crafted elements elsewhere in the movie. This, unfortunately, ends up being just bad. That is a shame, because I honestly did like (albeit mildly) the stuff at the venue.Very surprised to see the fairly good reception this has received so far on a few sites, I would not have predicted that but, hey, what do I know?",

Night Shyamalan's decision to make his daughter the leading lady of Act 2.5\/3ish was shameless and, by the time she really started \"acting\" it all fell apart. It was like someone clipped the strings on a marionette and u could see the poor doll just crumple on the floor.This man has worked with big name actors all over the world so he knows talent. And his daughter could not act her way out of a wet paper bag with a hole already in it. She is a great singer. I was really liking the original music and she performed well in that area, but every single scene she was in that required actual acting was so cringe. It was incredibly difficult to watch.Now, if she was not in the film and the plot was tightened up, it might have been watchable. Josh Hartnett did well enough for what he had to work with and Alison Pill can always be relied on to deliver a great performance.But Kid Cudi contributed less than nothing. British, beloved child star and now almost 80 year old Hayley Mills as an active, American FBI agent was a bit of a stretch. Let's just be honest. And, after not seeing her for so long, she should have been reintroduced to modern audiences in something more appropriate for her talents.All in all, it was a s---show and I almost walked out. The theater was full, surprisingly, and when it was over, nobody reacted. Everybody just looked around until the mid-credit scene where we all collectively cringed again. This was Easily M. Night Shyamalan's worst movie, which is a shame because there were some good performances.Please save your money and your time. There are better movies on Tubi.",

There is no intrigue, no suspense, for everything is read ahead. You are waiting to be surprised. Waiting, and waiting ... and waiting. Nothing happens. Everyone is moving, song keep coming, and yet ... no impact at all, no\nstakes, no WOW moments.You just can't believe how dull the story is, which is holded solely on Josh's charisma. He is an extremely good in this movie, some of the acting choices are brilliant. Without him, it would be impossible to watch this nonsense.

        "body":"Cooper (Josh Hartnett) takes his daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue) to the concert of pop idol Lady Raven (Saleka Shyamalan) and notices upon entrance that there's an unnusually high level of police and security personel. Cooper eventually learns the concert is part of a sting operation to catch the unknown serial killer called \"The Butcher\" who happens to be him. With the trap closing in around him, Cooper tries to find his way out of the concert without alerting his daughter or being caught by the police.Trap is the latest film from writer\/director M. NIght Shyamalan. The film is a collaboration between M. Night and his daughter Saleka (who also co-stars in the movie) with the premise having originated from conversations between the two of combining a concert experience with a film experience with the two citing Purple Rain as inspiration with the two eventually coming up with a premise descibred as \"Silence of the Lambs at a Taylor Swift concert\". Trap is a throwback to high concept thrillers from the pre-franchise era, and while it does have some pretty glaring flaws it ultimately results in a fun B-movie thriller.Josh Hartnett is very good in the lead role of Cooper as he presents a very likable and charming image of this loving and devoted father while also effortlessly turning into a sneaky and manipulative opportunist when the situation calls for it. In many ways the movie feels like it's part of that revival of inverted mysteries such as Poker Face or other Columbo inspired thrillers where the POV is locked on our main villain and Hartnett certainly provides one worth being invested in. The movie does a good job incorporating both the concert and the howcatchem narrative with Cooper as we see a lot of the internal mechanisms involving the concert from Cooper's point of view and seeing how he pieces them together. I think the movie probably could've done more to incorporate some of the soundtrack into the action (my gold standard for this kind of music\/thriller mash-up is Phantom of the Paradise) and it does often feel like the two are happening parallel to each other rather than fully mixing as you want them to. I also did notice some messiness in the third act as Hayley Mills initially seems like she's poised to be our Columbo equivalent (great to see her again) but she's kind of sidelined as we give more focus to another character who does a decent job in their acting debut, but a pretty pivotal scene doesn't have them conveying the kind of force the scenario calls for. The third act also maybe goes on a bit too long with how many narrow misses and close calls the screenplay incorporates (one of which I'm not sure how it was possible no one noticed) but it does at least move fast enough that it never feels like it drags.Trap has an inspired high concept mash-up that's anchored to a great performance by Hartnett that helps the movie overcome some of its more glarring issues and remain a good time. Admittedly it is a bit rough in how it mines its central concept and is definitely one of those movies that's better while you are watching it rather than in hindsight (think something like Law Abiding Citizen for example) and if you do see this on a big screen in a packed house you'll get an engaging experience.",

The plot makes no sense at all, like I cannot even try to suspend my belief because the whole thing does not make any logical sense. The serial killer gets away with things because the people around him have a negative IQ. It's like this movie was written by someone who has never been to a concert before. In order to avoid spoilers, I'll just say there's a lot of blatant neglect for safety that would not occur in a real concert. Also, all of the arena staff are incredibly friendly and trusting towards our main concert attendee for no reason. Another main character in this film by Shamalan's daughter, who cannot act to save her life and it honestly ruins the second half of the film even more since she is mostly in it. I don't mind nepotism if the natural talent is there, but this is not the case here at all. The whole movie felt like a music video to promote his daughter's music, with a weak serial killer hunt going on in the background.

If you take a closer look, there are often various reasons for the latter. However, the bashing of his person seems to have been a social media trend among so-called film critics for years. My anticipation of a new release is always positive, with an interesting idea, lots of question marks before and during the viewing, a quality look and guaranteed entertainment. Trap is no exception, perhaps even the best of his last films. Josh Hartnett as a charismatic, smart psychopath is fun, the wink is omnipresent. In my opinion, everything is deliberately over the top. And Shyamalan manages to pull off a special trick: the viewer ends up on the objectively wrong side up to a certain point. And depending on how psychopathic you are, perhaps even longer. In line with this, there may be another interesting momentum: who or what is that next to us (really)?At the beginning, I had one sticking point in the good momentum: the apparent promotion of his daughter, including the excessive running time. But perhaps this irrelevant pop star droning reminded me too much of current hypes. Otherwise it was a worthwhile 100 minutes, exciting, entertaining, humorous, threatening, bizarre.

Here Shyamalan returns with his particular suspense inherited from the films of Alfred Hitchcock or Brian de Palma with this thriller starring Josh Harnett (Pearl Harbor, Penny Dreadful) about a serial killer with many skilled resources who is trapped in a police trap of great dimensions: a macro concert.With a series of tense situations, numerous plot twists, a closed space and a suffocating atmosphere, together with brief comic elements, Shyamalan moves away from adaptations and returns to his roots. The protagonist Josh Harnett gives an acceptable performance as the father of a teenage daughter who goes to a macro pop music concert, to realize there is something strange in the environment and that something disturbing is happening. The film relies heavily on the bizarre personality of our starring and the claustrophobic ambient of the macro concert. The main character bears a certain resemblance to James McAvoy from Split film (2016). Star Josh harnett is well accompanied by a good cast, such as: Ariel Donoghue as his happy teen daughter , Alison Pill as the as the naive mother, Saleka Night Shyamalan (daughter of M. Night) as Lady Raven, Jonathan Langdon, Marcia Bennett and the veteran and previously child prodigy Hayley Mills as the stubborn criminalist.The motion picture was well made by Night M Shyamalan , writing , producing and directing , though being some claustrophobic and slow-moving at times. He usually shoots in Philadelphia , this is Shyamalan favorite location, though Trap (2024) was filmed in Toronto, Mississauga, Ontario, Hamilton, Canada. Night is an avid comic books fan , which was made in his films \"Unbreakable\" , \"Glass\" and ¨Multiple¨ they belong to a top-notch trilogy starred by Bruce Willis , Samuel L Jackson and James McAvoy. Well produced by Night Shyamalan himself , many of his films involve pivotal roles with extraordinary abilities or events happening to them and with children always having family problems . Night Shyamalan is an expert on fantastic and Mystery films plenty of Intelligence and thought-provoking issues as proved in : Signs , The village , Lady in water , The Incident , The sixth sense , with exception to an extreme flop as crítical as boxoffice : Airbender. Rating 6.5\/10 , almost notable . Well worth watching . Better than average.",

        "body":"In Philadelphia, the fireman and family man Cooper (Josh Hartnett) goes with his daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue) to the concert of the pop star Lady Raven (Saleka Shyamalan) in an arena. Ariel is a great student and has had three A's and one B at school and he wants to reward her. Soon Cooper notes the movement of several police officers in the arena and the salesman Jamie (Jonathan Langdon) that he has just befriended tells him that the police know that the notorious serial-killer \"The Butcher\" is in the concert. Further, there are 3,000 police officers and the arena is under siege. Cooper is \"The Butcher\" and spends the concert trying to find a way to leave the arena. Riley finds the behavior of her father weird, but she does not suspect anything. But soon Cooper finds a way to leave the arena with Riley without raising any suspect from the FBI and the police officers.\"Trap\" (2024) is a movie by M. Night Shyamalan with a great and tense first half, then only annoying cliches like many movies made for TV. Josh Hartnett is convincing as a smart serial killer and devoted family man. But the exaggeration of his astuteness in the second half turns the movie into a comedy. Ariel Donoghues is also convincing as the enthusiastic fan of the pop star. Despite the nepotism, Saleka Shyamalan does a good job in the role of Lady Raven. The absurd conclusion is too silly. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): \"Armadilha\" (\"Trap\")",

While the movie isn't groundbreaking or a standout in Shyamalan's career, it's undeniably competent and shows his ability to tell a story effectively.

And, what a surprise, this singer is his daughter Saleka.So now (unlike the movie) everything makes sense... Not the slightest indication of violence (which one might expect, since the main character is called \"the Butcher\"), just so that the movie can be rated PG13... the target audience for Saleka's music... - I am utterly disappointed!",

It was a different take on a well tried cat and mouse hunt for a serial Killer and M Night went out of his way to not give us the obvious, and that hasn't sat well with people.For a start our bad guy is the protagonist, M Night flips the script and makes him a doting dad, and gets us on his side before he lets us know who he is. There is no gore in the film and we don't see him do anything nasty, although we are told he does these things.Much of the film plays off stereotypes and there's a twist to many of them.You could pick holes in the film but then you've missed the point of it. It's playing with tropes for entertainment. You need to be open to enjoying it for that.Someone had a dig at M Night for making a comedy, but there is humour in this. It does have elements of black comedy in it, it's entertaining, not a straight up slasher horror. It's not as dumb as low expectation standard horror fans think it is.",

The scenario seemed to exist solely to promote his daughter, as the storyline was not only unfulfilling, but riddled with so many logical errors that it became frustrating to watch.We hadn't checked the cast beforehand, so during the extended concert scene, we kept wondering why it featured so many songs and dragged on for far too long. Then it clicked : his DAUGHTER was the one performing. What started off as a mildly annoying sequence quickly turned into a disaster once her acting came into scene. I can't even call it acting. It felt like she wasn't trying at all. She barely moved, her facial expressions were super dull and probably worried about messing up her makeup or hair.This felt like the worst kind of \"nepo baby\" showcase, and it really soured the experience.

Unfortunately, despite a strong start, the film failed to fully capitalize on the psychological pressure it attempted to build. The initial scenes hinted at a complex narrative filled with mind games, but as the plot progressed, the tension never quite reached the heights it aspired to. Instead of tightening the screws on the audience's nerves, the film often resorted to predictable twists and drawn-out scenes that diluted the intensity. I wish the incredibly interesting psychological movie it could have been would've been exploited more. Still an alright movie.",

Through sheer will, and a bit of artistry, a father is able to manifest the dreams of his daughter (and escalate them to a pinnacle).The portrayal of parent conflict with the psycho mother of his daughter's friend was all too familiar, being hounded at inopportune times and cornered into scheduling a kid date with an antagonist. All the human interactions were spot on as the director has certainly experienced these things first hand.Whether your hobby is murdering people or making films, sometimes being a dad is more important.",

        "body":"Even his most vociferous critics concede that M. Night Shyamalan has made some interesting, entertaining films. 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable,' his third and fourth features, are generally considered to be his finest, though later works- most notably 'Split'- are also quite enjoyable. However, his filmography is populated more by duds than hits. From 'The Happening' and 'After Earth' to 'Old', Shyamalan has made many convoluted, dull and downright moronic movies, that no-one- not even his mother- could love.His newest venture, 'Trap', follows Cooper and his daughter Riley, who attend a concert for their favourite musician, pop star Lady Raven. They've been looking forward to it for ages, and are excited as all get out. However, the gig is not what it seems. The whole show is, in fact, an elaborate sting operation, to capture a serial killer known as The Butcher. With the police outside, and The Butcher among the fans, will anyone survive; and with this film, does Shyamalan have a hit on his hands, or yet another dud?Perhaps unsurprisingly, considering its ludicrous premise, 'Trap' is tatty nonsense, with a predictable narrative so full of plot holes and cliches it makes Shyamalan's egregious 'Old' look like the work of Orson Welles. One would be forgiven for assuming that a four-year-old child wrote the screenplay, so mindlessly ridiculous the film is throughout its interminable 105-minutes. Nothing in it makes sense. From the beginning to the end, it's balderdash of the highest level. Logic has no place in Shyamalan's world. Take the police, for example. Nearly everything they do in their hunt for The Butcher is the opposite of what they should be doing; almost as if the entire force were on the serial killer's side.Moreover, the characterisation involved is asinine, slim and cliched, especially that involving The Butcher. In addition, characters do not act rationally, nor do they act irrationally in a consistent manner: they are whatever Shyamalan wants them to be in the moment, whether or not it makes sense. What's worse: the film lacks suspense, without any tension or gripping moments- the death knell for a thriller.Further, the dialogue is laughably stilted, making one wonder if Shyamalan has ever had a conversation with a real person before. It is so utterly unnatural it's genuinely puzzling how anyone who read the script could possibly agree to star in it (unless, of course, you were related to the filmmaker).However, there are some reasonably bright spots in the teeming pit of underwhelment that 'Trap' is, namely Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's cinematography. His use of close ups and quick pans effectively generates the energy that the narrative sorely lacks, which Herdís Stefánsdóttir's score compounds. However, Saleka Shyamalan's songs for Lady Raven- which are made such a focal point one wonders if her father made the whole film simply to give her a platform to sing and dance- are generic and dull, though she performs them well.Josh Hartnett stars as Cooper, and his performance is either quite clever, or rather poor, depending on how you look at it. On the one hand, the character he is playing is acting themselves, trying to project the visage of normality, as it were. In the stressful situation Cooper finds himself in, that visage slips and begins to crack, appearing unnatural and forced. Therefore, the fact that Hartnett is over-the-top and slightly off could be a clever approach to the role. On the other hand, maybe that's not the case, and he just misjudged his performance.Ariel Donoghue stars as Riley, and doesn't get all that much to do, really, bar shouting and screaming for Lady Raven, which she does energetically enough. The aforementioned Saleka Shyamalan stars as Lady Raven, and her father really should have gone in a different direction other than home when casting that particular role- and when getting someone to write the songs too, for that matter.She brings to mind Sofia Coppola in 'The Godfather Part III.' Directed by her father, Coppola was incredibly wooden, much like Shyamalan in 'Trap.' Although, considering the terrible dialogue; no one could perform admirably in her role. Additionally, Alison Pill and Hayley Mills both have small roles as Rachael, Cooper's wife, and an FBI profiler, respectfully, and anyone could have stepped into their near miniscule parts and been as effective as they.In short, M. Night Shyamalan's 'Trap' is another in the long line of misfires the director has had over his career. In fact, looking at his filmography, he's had more misses than hits- a lot more. With a senseless narrative, stilted dialogue and slim characterisation, it's not got much to offer. Although the cinematography and score are both good, the songs performed by the Lady Raven character are dull, and the cast do uncommendable work. To put it succinctly and not beat around the bush, 'Trap' is utterly crap.",

        "body":"Some reviews have said this film loses its compass and concludes poorly. They're looking at it backward. This film finishes quite strong and its gripping turn of events in the second half rescues it from oblivion. It's the early part that's tough getting through and it looks as though the creative premise might be squandered. But some inventive plot points get the film back on track.A working class dad takes his teenage daughter to the mega event of her dreams, a flamboyant concert by a Lady Gaga-esque pop star. As it turns out, he is a sadistic serial killer who is hunted by law enforcement, who've been tipped off that he'll be in attendance. Josh Hartnett gives a committed performance that elevates the sloppy screenplay and occasionally cartoonish dialogue (seems to be a pattern for Shyamalan). Hartnett is unsettling as a psychopath who shifts from goofball dad to the Incredible Hulk with appalling swiftness. The real wild card is Saleka Shyamalan who steals in the film in a vixenish, captivating performance as the starlet who turns out to play a more vital role than one would expect. Hayley Mills from \"The Parent Trap\" is cleverly cast here as an FBI profiler who's hot on the trail of her target.Implausibilities bubble up in the storyline but the pacing and tension picks up so much toward the end, that I felt inclined to forgive the occasional lapses in credibility. In terms of overall achievement, this film goes from potential Hitchcockian thriller to settling more for B-movie status, but with character and gritty effort. Recommended to those who can check their brains at the door and enjoy some wild-eyed craziness.",

His latest project may go down as a disappointment when compared to the rest of his iconic filmography, but as its own movie, Trap is an above average viewing. The first act did a particularly nice job of drawing me in, however as the movie progressed, the suspense and mystery slowly faded as the story became too crowded to give the characters room to breathe. Though, Hartnett's charismatic and unhinged performance gave me something to enjoy regardless. I appreciate Warner Bros continuing to allow Shyamalan to take risks making higher-budget original films, even if they don't always work, it's fun to watch an unexplored concept merge with a talented director's vision.

However, despite the initial potential, several wrong decisions compromised the final result of the work.The absence of graphic violence reduces the impact of the film, generating few scenes of true tension. The script relies on several conveniences, making the protagonist seem more \"lucky\" than strategist. Furthermore, the superficial development of the serial killer makes his arc not very engaging, which negatively affects the construction of the character. The twist in the third act is not surprising and seems unnecessary, wasting the opportunity for a remarkable outcome, something expected in the director's films. On the other hand, the soundtrack and its theme is a strong point, differentiating itself from other productions of the genre and adding value to the narrative.Although technically well produced, the film has flaws that undermine the impact of the proposal. \"Trap\" ends up becoming another generic psychological horror film, despite its interesting musical theme.",

Back in the 1900's, theaters were smart enough that they knew they would never rake in barrels of box office receipts if they allowed nepotism to run rampant.

Uncanny. But yet, I kept thinking why is J. H. so tall? Throughout the whole movie. Then the twist! When his true colors emerged, he truly manifested a very scary dude.

        "body":"The first half of the Trap was really exciting, giving me exactly what I expected from the trailer: a tense, thriller-like story with scenes that felt like how a real serial killer would handle situations. This part of the movie was truly impressive, with Josh Hartnett playing Cooper's character really well. Every move and decision Cooper made felt believable, showing his dark and troubled past.The first half was well-constructed and thrilling, but unfortunately, the story fell apart in the second half. The plot started to lose its logic, and more and more strange, unexplainable things happened. One of the most obvious examples was when the main character just disappeared from a surrounded car, with no explanation on how he escaped. This kind of illogical event kept happening throughout the second half, ruining everything the film had built up.Instead of action-packed scenes, the first half was filled with tense and thrilling moments. However, these moments disappeared in the second half, and the plot moved in a direction that didn't hold my attention anymore. Rather than sticking with the serial killer theme, the movie focused too much on the character's dark past, which didn't really serve the story well. This character development didn't fit with the earlier events and only slowed down the pace.In conclusion, the Trap had a good idea and executed it well in the first half, but the second half completely fell apart. The illogical plot and poor direction made the film lose all the momentum it had built. While the beginning was exciting and promising, overall, I can only give it a 6 out of 10.",

He tries to sell this lazy slop with maximum effort.In short, a superstar singer (who is definitely not Saleka but she's in that role) is having a concert solely for the purpose of trying to catch a killer. Hartnett is taking his daughter to the concert and is curious about what is going on. He's able to navigate anywhere and everywhere with ease to the point of absolute stupidity and contrivance. After all, if Taylor Swift had a concert, wouldn't it be filled with open doors that say \"no entry\" or \"security\" and you could be hooked into the entire security personnel, the police, the swat team, Taylor's entire security team, and then talk your way into having your daughter appear on stage with Taylor and have private conversations with Taylor backstage because somehow Taylor just feels like she knows this guy who she spoke to for all of 10 seconds?This is truly terrible. It looks and feels like a vehicle to showcase M. Night's daughter's acting career. And quite frankly, she isn't convicing at all, about as bad as your average C-grade horror film slasher actress. It's unfortunate because the director (her dad) didn't tell her that you actually need to act like you're scared if you're supposed to be scared. But this was more about trying to showcase her music career, which is average to slightly better than average talent that wouldn't go anywhere if she didn't have a father to make her into a movie star with a big name actor.This becomes interminable and beyond foolish at the 35 minute and 45 minute mark. Yes, there is a cameo by M. Night that isn't convincing and then more singing and performing by his daughter because, well, it's his daughter.This is really not bad and quite embarrassing.",

You aren't able to see Cooper do too many cool things throughout the concert or else his daughter would literally be saying \"You're weird dad or you're acting strange\" The film could have honestly been rated PG if they didn't say one \"F Bomb.\" The more intriguing aspect would have been to go into more depth of \"The Profilier\" or background on this serial killer.The film is not much different than what you would find say on a news channel about a serial killer.I was intrigued\/sort of excited to see the film based on the trailer and even went on opening night. Overall M Night films have been on the decline recently with \"Old\" and \"Knock at the Cabin\" as well has his daughters recent movie \"The Watchers\" performed poorly. I think M Night has been using his early fame\/name for trailers and promotion for something like \"The Watchers\" or in this film exposure for his other daughter Saleka Shyamalan who stars and performs a concert for songs she personally wrote, which are not that great.*PS near the end of the film Cooper takes off his shirt for \"practically\" no reason.....1\/5\nI honestly can't find any redeeming factors of this movie except that it looks adequate and Hartnett isn't the \"worst\"",

It was tame af.After the movie was done and I was looking up the cast, I was not at all surprised to learn that Lady Raven was M Night's daughter. The entire purpose of this movie seemed to be to get her into the music industry. She's good at singing, but that's not why anyone went to this movie.All in all, I was disappointed with this film. It felt more like the first half of a movie than the entire film. It was very straight forward with no M Night twist to it.The saving grace of this film is Josh Hartnett. He is phenomenal in it and the only reason it turned out to be a somewhat enjoyable experience.As I said, this felt like the first half of the film so I assume there will be a sequel.

It's so damn refreshing to see such a charismatic actor back in the spotlight. He might even be at his most versatile here which is impressive after taking such a long hiatus . The way this film is also compositioned and shot is also impeccable and it creates its own personality in that aspect. M. Night's eye for detail seems to still be distinctly sharp. Overall, I'd honestly say this is better than the last few Shyamalan films which were all individually solid on their own.

All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.Jon Watts' direction is superb, the action sequences are thrillingly acrobatic once again but refreshingly impactful this time around. There's a few homages to the styles of the previous iterations and some gorgeous imagery.It's also perfectly paced with none of its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime feeling dull or overly long due to a strong momentum established early on. The CG is extremely impressive with only a few weak spots.The music by Michael Giacchino is fantastic, a nice balance of themes from the previous iterations and use of Holland's iconic motifs which are slightly altered in ways that work as well as a few new additions that are beautifully epic.",

        "body":"I was already concerned about Spider-Man: No Way Home when I walked into the theater (one could say I was expecting to be disappointed.) I kind of hate the idea of delving too deep into a multiverse, because I think it muddles things too much, and defies the internal logic of most stories. Sure enough that was something I felt while watching this film. This movie cannot hold up to even the tiniest bit of analysis, because it creates plot holes that you can drive a freight train through. It's kind of sad because there were some moments in the movie that I genuinely loved, but all I can think about days later are the myriad of questions that I'm left with because this movie created so many situations that make no sense.My other big problem with Spider-Man: No Way Home is not really a fault of the movie, but more of the society we live in today. Living in an internet-focused culture, we are bombarded by ads and news stories that relate to the things that interest us. SInce I've shown my love for all things MCU in the past, of course I see plenty of things crossing my radar about the upcoming films. I was able to avoid watching any trailers for this movie, which I thought would help, but by merely catching headlines of casting rumors I could foresee every surprise they built into it. Of course any logical mind could put two and two together once the guest appearances start, so I suppose this isn't a movie that is going to blow away audiences with its surprises.As I said, though, my disappointment is quite frustrating because I also found many aspects of No Way Home so satisfying. They wrapped up some story elements nicely, and this might have contained some of the best acting in any Marvel movie. In particular, I found Zendaya so surprisingly strong, I was almost able to ignore her lack of character motivation in some key moments. She wasn't the only person in the film that behaved stupidly, in fact the central premise of the film is built on a horrible idea from Aunt May that seems altruistic, but lacks any 4th-dimensional thinking which I would expect from a genius like Peter Parker. But smart people being dumb is the catalyst of the entire story, as even Dr. Strange doesn't seem to think anything through, past Peter's initial request.No Way Home is easily the most meta Spider-Man movie ever made, which is kind of shocking to say in a post \"Into the Spider-verse\" world. It's catering to the most die-hard fans in the world, but it's more of a nod to the fans of the Spider-Man movies. I was always a huge fan of the multitude of Spider-Man comic books when I was a collector, but I've typically struggled with his portrayal in films. So, giving all these nods to things that came before Tom Holland took over the role on the big screen, falls a bit flat for me. One of the things I loved about this iteration of the character is that it avoided the cliches and saved us so much of the traditional Spider-Man origin story, but this movie back-pedaled and became a copy of a copy of a copy.This return to cliche also sucked some of the emotion out of key moments as any fan of the character should know the same old tropes by now. I almost got emotional at the end because of the great acting performances, but the big emotional moment earlier in the film did nothing for me as all I could think was \"really, we're going there?\" There are some good laughs in the film, although I wonder how well it will hold up on rewatch. And I will rewatch this film, as I do with all MCU movies, but I think at this point Spider-Man: No Way Home sits as my least favorite in the franchise. In fact, I'm at a point right now where I'm questioning if I will keep being a diehard fan of everything the MCU churns out. This film wasn't what I'd call a complete failure, but I'm concerned the MCU is getting closer to one of those. Perhaps EndGame should have been exactly what the title implies.",

But a great film needs more than that. The story also moves along with some pace. But emotional impact should never be sacrificed for expediency. In short, this is an enjoyable film, but there have been better Marvel films.There is one scene that stands above the rest. And it is guaranteed to bring a smile to the lips of any Marvel fan. It has so much subtext and it is so unexpected.It ends with a tee-up for the next chapter, of course. I just hope that one focuses more on the characters and less on the effects. It certainly has that possibility, given where this episode ends.",

        "body":"Spider man has always been my favourite character, due to the nostalgia of reading the comic as a kid, or just the characters sheer brilliance. In the last two movies that Holland did as spider man, I was slightly disappointed because we only got to see a child who was constantly babied by Tony Stark. The Spider-Man who we watched in Homecoming and Far From Home hadn't really earned his place in my heart, with Holland's childish charm being over used and making the character of Peter Parker a boy who frankly doesn't live up to the standard set by his predecessors. In this movie however, not only did it give me a nerdgasm due to the fantastic ensemble cast, but I finally got to see Holland flex his acting muscles and show me whey he was cast in his role and why he has reached his levels of stardom.This movie was brilliant. The emotional themes which were laced into he movie kept the plot moving, with Holland, Willem Dafoe and Marissa Tomei showing us why they were truly hired. Unlike previous Spidey movies like TASM and Far From Home, this one truly captured my attention and boasted the elements of Spidey that I love so much.I will admit that when going into the movie, I was very hesitant about them bringing back the old Spider Men and villains, because I believed that they were better left untouched, but after watching the movie, all of my negative thoughts were blown away. Each villain gets their own time to shine, each of them harness their old selves whilst also elevating their characteristics.Toby and Andrew both come back, something which elicited screams of joy from everyone in the theatre. They were brilliant. Toby was calm but excited, mature but fun, wise but still held that social awkwardness that we all adored back in the day. Andrew in my opinion, was way better as Spidey in this movie than any of his own. There was a pure emotion behind Andrew's Spidey and we finally get to see why he was cast as Spidey. It worked. Having three socially awkward super powered nerds somehow worked.I won't lie when I say that this is by far my favourite Spidey movie of all time. There were so many tear jerker moments in the movie, with Tom Holland standing out in all of them. He finally showed me SPIDER-MAN in capital letters. His character's emotions were so believable due to the way in which he portrayed them. His character came across as human, as someone who makes mistakes and then seeks ways to fix it, in order to keep those who he loves safe.The classic uncle Ben line gets dropped multiple times in this movie, finally making this 'Home' trilogy as Holland's Spidey's origin story in a sense. We see how the famous Uncle Ben quote truly makes an impact on Peter at the end, making us cry with tears of sadness but also pride.My words cannot express how much I loved this movie. Especially that final scene.",

        "body":"Instantly loathing the publicity of being outed by the press, Spider-Man hits up the Sanctum Sanctorum to ask Dr. Strange for some mystical assistance. They cast a spell of wiped memory and screw it up, reality is torn, familiar faces invade different spaces... you know this, you've seen the trailer. It's the Sony\/MCU equivalent of X-Men: Days of Future Past, with a stream of old band members coming out of retirement for a jam-packed farewell concert.One might hope that the results are a smidge better than that old X-Men reunion, and they are, but No Way Home also suffers from many of the same problems. Primarily, the overwhelming urge to stuff as much crap on the screen as possible, even when the audience is already exhausted. It tries to serve too many masters and, in the end, sufficiently serves none. There's fun to be had, especially when the oddball mix-and-match super-characters get the chance to escape the trappings of a broader storyline and simply converse as individuals. Those accessible human interactions have been a big strength for the two preceding Marvel Spider-Man flicks, and they reap great benefits here, each time the old guard mingles with the new.I wish we had more such moments, but the push to turn the MCU's most grounded franchise into another big-time tent pole attraction demands otherwise. In reaching for the next major event, they've overlooked the \"neighborhood\" part of \"Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.\" Actually, they might've forgotten the \"friendly\" part, too, because there's a whole bunch of angst spinning around Tom Holland's central performance. But that's more excusable: Peter Parker goes through a lot over the course of this hundred-fifty minutes, he progresses and matures as a character, and he's experienced equally dark times in the comics.No, the performances aren't the issue here, nor is the dialogue, which remains snappy and delightful. The primary culprit is the plot, bloating and careening in indeterminate (and often mindless) directions, making a lot of noise but not making a lot of sense. Dr. Strange hand-waves many explanations under the guise of mysticism, which is basically his thing, but so do the various Spider-Men. Important members of the supporting cast are marginalized and under-served. The city of New York, once an essential ingredient, is now barely a backdrop. Goalposts are moved, overshadowed, and then moved again. Rumor has it that script re-writes were still underway during filming, and it shows.This is messy. Lots of fun on certain occasions, but stifling and sludgy in others. It's a mixed bag, leaning more to the positive than the negative, but I don't know that I'm content with the way everything wraps up in the end. Where Homecoming and Far From Home both left me charged and anxious for the next step, No Way Home put me in a place of quiet acceptance. Feels like the franchise has aged, and that's not a great thing.",

To tell the truth, this exceeded my expectations with great power.With surprisingly good acting and great emotionally loaded scenes, No Way Home managed to capture something many Marvel movies fail. Emotions. This was not only an action-packed movie but also a story-driven movie with fantastic execution. Tom Holland and Zendaya as well as other actors managed to deliver acting never seen in the Marvel universe before.No Way Home captured that heart of the first couple of Spider-man trilogy which I think old fans will admire. Nevertheless, I believe this movie was fantastically done and little mistakes.No Way Home is a great movie I highly recommend.

I loved the recall of old villains, it was great to see Foxx, Molina and Dafoe come back again and it's clear they're having fun. Cumberbatch is good in a limited role too. Best of all are Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire, who light up the screen and make all of their scenes delightful; they show up Holland, that's for sure.

        "body":"Easily the most anticipated and theorised comic book film since Avengers: Endgame. Spider-Man: No Way Home is set directly after the end of Far From Home. With Spider-Man's (Tom Holland) identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. When the spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear.It was always going to be difficult for this to live up to the myriad of potential expectations that had built up in mine and millions of others heads after the first trailer released back in August. Luckily throughout its duration No Way Home excels at fan pleasing moments and truly giving Peter monumental stakes and potential consequences. However it is undeniably overstuffed and choppy, as well as for me personally a lot of the MCU'isms not always particularly gelling well with the returning villains.I will be keeping the plot details vague, but for those who had expectations and ideas of what the film might be, it probably is pretty much what you expect. The opening act ripple effect of Peter's identity being revealed, with he, MJ and Ned being turned down by colleges and constant harassment sets the stage well and understandably Peter's desperation for Doctor Strange to fix it. From there the rogues gallery pour through and it's up to Peter to stop them.Here is where some of my favourite aspects of the film are, as well as my irritations. It's undeniably great seeing these characters return to the big screen, and throughout the second act it is uniquely executed and delivers some satisfying interactions between the foes (though some of their motivations could have been a bit more fleshed out), as well as time to breathe. However it is once again the abundance of joke attempts and alterations to a couple of the characters that just make some of the interactions feel awkward and cringe inducing.Doc Ock's bridge battle is a standout return and the choreography, sound design and score all intertwine nicely. Holland wasn't lying about this being a darker and more violent entry into the franchise, with the first Goblin brawl being the film's highlight, alongside the jaw-dropping visual spectacle of the mirror dimension duel. The final action set piece is pure spectacle and grin inducingly fun, it's just a shame that yet again it's another CGI heavy sequence set at night, so it's frequently hard to see what's going on at certain points.This is probably Holland's best Spider-Man performance as he really has some emotional heavy lifting to do, as well as keeping the quips and enthusiasm fresh. Willem Dafoe absolutely steals the film. He's still got all of it: the grin, the laugh, the expressions and genuine menace. Molina as well, brilliantly capturing the commanding intelligence and personality of Doc Ock and Jamie Foxx is far better suited in this iteration of Electro. Benedict Cumberbatch adds a layer of bitterness and snark to Strange, yet keeps his core values and dedication to help in check.Spider-Man: No Way Home may just be the film many fans of dreamed of. Unfortunately for me, whilst it still delivered a lot of what I wanted, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed. Dafoe & Molina prove once again why Spider-Man 1 & 2 will never be topped, the increased personal stakes for Peter are welcome and I'm still partially in awe that the film actually happened. However the leering presence of now extremely familiar and annoying MCU traits and tropes, certain character interactions and an overstuffed storyline do hold it back.",

And then, in a weird tonal shift, the movie gets really dark, and then tries to go back to the light-hearted bit with that hanging over it, and does some more really silly stuff, and some rather confused but fast-paced action, and then goes for a sad thing that I found kinda boring, and, well, what is this supposed to *be*.It doesn't make much sense, it's tonally chaotic, and as with the previous film, the action is fleetfully enjoyable but entirely forgettable.Still, a reasonable amount of the humor works, it's fun to see the way they play with the multiverse, and there's definitely fun to be had. But I find it perplexing how many people love this movie because to me it's a mess. It should have just stuck with silly all the way through.",

Unbelievably outstanding performances from everyone involved, especially Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Willem Dafoe.A heartfelt, nostalgic homage to the Spider-Man legacy that fans will rewatch countless times, laughing and crying along for many more years to come.A memorable, passionate, once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience.\"Rating: A.",

Ever since this movie's announcement, you knew this was a bigger deal than the usual superhero flicks. And being a movie with such high expectations, means that there's so much room for things to go wrong. And unfortunately... It seems like it did.Now I'm fresh out of the theatre, and I already feel like this movie had so much potential wasted. A sentiment I also share towards Avengers Endgame; where the only thing the writers seemed to worry about was 'fan-service'. Fan service is fine honestly, but the line should be when fan-service slowly starts taking over for storytelling. Because the storytelling in this movie was childish.Don't get me wrong... I enjoyed the movie... I enjoyed the theatre experience... It was fun... But fun is not enough when you realize what could have been. Spiderman: No Way Home could have been Marvel's most ambitious project yet, but it has the curse of Marvel's horrible writing staff who similarly messed up everything from Avengers Endgame, to WandaVision, to Falcon and the Winter Soldier, to Loki and to Black Widow. The plot of the movie sounds like some cheap fan fiction that somehow got made. And what's even worse is its absolutely cringe worthy dialogue; existing for the sole purpose of reminding the audience of previous Spiderman movies. It's such a dumb and convenient plot that just exists for the sake of nostalgia.I loved Avengers Infinity War and I really enjoyed Spiderman Far From Home, but I haven't enjoyed a single Marvel project since, because all their projects have been so shallow with no real substance to back itself up. Marvel has a writing problem that needs to be looked into, for the sake of cinema and storytelling.What a missed opportunity... What an absolutely missed opportunity...",

If they let go, they're attacked. However, despite this interesting concept, the movie fails to create the tense atmosphere the story demands. Instead of pulling us into a truly dangerous and desperate situation, the film loses focus and struggles to convey the real threat the characters face.The plot twists are another weak point. Some are too predictable, and from early on, I felt like I could guess where the story was heading. Though I'm not entirely sure, because the ending is especially confusing and poorly explained, leaving us without a clear conclusion - as if the writer wasn't sure what message they wanted to convey.Director Alexandre Aja has proven capable of crafting good films with simpler themes, like the remake of The Hills Have Eyes, High Tension, or Piranha 3D, but whenever he tackles more complex narratives, such as in Horns, he tends to fall short. In his case, \"less is more\" really applies.That said, I have to admit the different approach might attract viewers looking for something unusual. However, for me, this film didn't hit the mark. There was a moment of real tension involving the fate of an animal that made me anxious, but aside from that, I felt indifferent in about 80% of the situations.It's far from terrible due to the original concept that sets it apart from other films in this subgenre, but it lacks the essential ingredients to truly stand out or leave a lasting impression.",

There is an evil presence around them, and they only way to be safe in to be tied to a rope that's connected to the foundation of the house. This poses many questions: What the hell happened? Why can only the mom see the evil? What happens if the evil touches you? Is this a subtle metaphor for COVID? Is it even real? I like how when the audience has these questions, the kids also have questions. This movie kept me guessing for the majority of the time. The acting is great for everybody. The atmosphere is dense and feels claustrophobic. Apparently, it was filmed right here in the woods of Vancouver, BC. The story could've gone a few different ways, and I would've chosen something different. The jump-scares are annoying, but I enjoyed the scares that came from the background of shots.

Prepared to question all that's throughout, it feels like there wasn't much resolution at the very end. It doesn't have the closure I was looking for; instead, it just leaves us with more questions. Some people like that mystery, but for me, it was just the slightest bit more explanation or one additional scene needed to help wrap up things nicely.That said, it's still worth watching, if not for any other reason than for those who love a good slow burn, psychologically thrilling plot.

Not sure if anybody paid attention to the ending shot but that answers the question in no uncertain terms.The question is whether or not the danger in the forest is real or just a figment of Halle Berry's imagination. It's a layered, heartfelt story of a woman and her two children living in isolation and what may very well be a case of a mother having ruined her life along with her two young sons due to untreated schizophrenia. Are there scary things in the woods? Are the ropes really protecting them? At different points in the film it's impossible to decide and it does keep you guessing until the end.Halle Berry is competent as always but the two young actors are real standouts here. They've got some heavy lifting for such young inexperienced actors and they do a shockingly good job. From about the midpoint on they are essentially carrying the film.Aside from some all around great acting the practical efx on the monsters in the Woods is refreshing. There is some small amount of CGI, but there's plenty of good old fashioned blood and makeup to make these creatures just strange looking enough to be mildly spooky.Overall Never Let Go has a lot going for it. It's not the first film to toss around the question of whether or not mental illness is at the root of the horror. I admit it's a widely used trope in this genre. But this movie handles it more competently than many others. And again it's helped out by some great child actors. I'll be expecting to see more of those boys in the near future.Solid 7\/10 for me.",

Jenkins) live with their momma (Halle Berry) in hiding from a force known as The Evil which has taken everyone else from the world including their father and grandparents. As Momma enforces a strict set of rules such as religious reverence to the house and only leaving the house with a rope attached to your person from the house, a schism develops between the more doubting Nolan and the more faithful Samuel.Never Let Go is a 2024 horror thriller directed by Alexandre Aja and written by Kevin Coughlin and Ryan Grassby. Originally written under the title Mother Land, the script was acquired by producer Shawn Levy's 21 Laps and Lionsgate Films during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in August of 2020, no doubt due to its limited location and small cast which would make filming easier, but it wouldn't be until June of 2023 that production would actually commence. Never Let Go isn't a poorly made or poorly acted movie, but it's one that feels like it's a victim of being \"late to the party\" after several other films of a similar nature beat it to release.In the simplest terms, Never Let Go is basically what happens when you mix A Quiet Place with The Lodge as it has a similar \"secluded hideaway with gimmick\" premise like A Quiet Place (in this case always having a rope attached to the house) as well as the religious and parental distrust themes of The Lodge. Halle Berry is good playing momma and you can see why she was attracted to the part as it's a very hard edged role where the character is driven by love, fear, distrust and obsession. Despite both Percy Daggs IV and Anthony B. Jenkins feeling a little green in roles that require them to be front and center without much acting support from an extended cast, I think they do okay even if they don't quite meet the benchmarks seen in other comparable genre pieces. My primary sticking point when watching Never Let Go was an inescapable feeling of \"haven't I seen this before?\" as there's undeniable similarities to the likes of the A Quiet Place series, the Bird Box films, The Silence, Arcadian and several others that fit within this genre of limited location survival horror stories. While there's nothing wrong with revisiting a well traversed template, Never Let Go doesn't really feel like it has much of a spin on it that substantially differentiates it from any of the plethora of examples mentioned. Even with the nature of \"The Evil\", the movie takes a rather wishy washy approach to the antagonist not really committing to The Evil as a tangible presence or psychological one all the way through to a climax that just left me befuddled with how it decides to \"resolve\" the conflict. But aside from a rather disappointing payoff, Never Let Go often feels repetitive and like it's looking for reasons to spin its wheels to feature length as it's clear that this was a project written during Covid which is bending over itself to justify keeping itself as limited and small as possible without really having the substance to justify it.Despite the producers voiced desires to make this a franchise this is most likely a one and done affair as it didn't do all that well at the box office and I doubt many are actually curious to see where this concept goes. This is a movie that definitely suffers from a glut of similar movies to it having preceded it, but it doesn't even really do anything all that good with its concept even when taken on its own and just settles for being well made mediocrity.",

The movie does a great job of creating a creepy and eerie atmosphere that pulls you in and makes you feel uneasy. What I loved most is how it keeps you thinking - there were plenty of moments where I wasn't sure what was real and what wasn't. It's such a nice change from the usual horror movies that spell everything out for you.The plot is interesting and engaging, and unlike most horror films today, jumpscares are used only when they actually add to the tension. They don't rely on them just to scare you every two minutes. The acting is really good, too - it helps make the whole thing feel more real and adds to the creepy vibe.Now to my rant on horror movie reviews:\nAfter watching, I was excited to read some reviews and see if people shared my thoughts, but I was shocked by the number of people complaining. Some said the plot was \"too confusing,\" or that there weren't enough jumpscares, or they just didn't get it because they were distracted on their phones for half the movie.I feel like a lot of people just don't appreciate good horror anymore. They'd rather watch movies filled with cheap jumpscares and predictable plots, instead of something that actually makes them think. It's frustrating because real, scary horror movies are becoming so rare these days, and I'm worried about where the genre is headed if this is what people want.It can't just be me who thinks like this, right?",

        "body":"Never Let Go is a family drama, a supernatural horror film and a psychological thriller all at once. It stars excellent actress Halle Berry as well as child actors Percy Daggs IV and Anthony B. Jenkins. The film's plot is similar to M. Night Shyamalan's The Village. The story revolves around a mother and her two children who have taken refuge in a cabin in the woods. They live in complete isolation and suffer from starvation. The mother keeps telling her children that evil forces surround their home. The only way to avoid a grisly fate is by being tied to a series of ropes that are installed in the cabin's basement. As the children grow into teenagers, they slowly start to doubt their mother's stories. When they finally decide to let go of the ropes, a dramatic series of events occurs.This movie has several noteworthy strengths. First and foremost, the plot is clever and comes around with several twists and turns throughout. While the general idea of the story isn't new at all, it has been executed with enough wit to keep genre fans entertained from start to finish.Another remarkable strength is the acting in this film. Halle Berry excels as fragile, obsessive and strict mother. The two child actors convince throughout as well with one of them portraying a son who truly believes his mother's tales while the other one showcases a more rebellious, independent and free-spirited attitude. The two actors complete each other splendidly. Both of them should have great careers ahead of themselves.The locations have also been chosen with care. The old cabin truly underlines the simple, regressive and difficult lives that the three protagonists are living. The forest with its old trees, rough rocks and colourful moss is the perfect setting for a tale of isolation.However, this film isn't without flaws. The movie's pace is particularly slow and especially the film's first half needs resilient, optimistic and mature viewers who are open to give this film time to grow. They will be rewarded with a more dramatic second half.This movie is missing truly gripping scenes. A gloomy atmosphere is present from start to finish but the film plods along without any notable highlights. This is a very mild drama and thriller that would have benefitted from a few more intense sequences.At the end of the day, Never Let Go is a family drama, supernatural horror movie and psychological thriller that convinces with a clever plot, strong acting performances and fitting settings while suffering from a particularly slow pace and a lack of intensity. Never Let Go is thus recommended to mature, optimistic and resilient genre fans only.",

        "body":"6.8\/10 (Recommend)I don't think this movie is bad, but for all the tension it creates I feel that the ending isn't the complete justice that is being sought for. A story about a family who can't leave the safety of their house without a rope around them because an evil lurks in the forest. Everything comes into question when one of the children begin to question if the evil is real.Halle Berry is pretty decent in this film, but I don't think it's her performance that carries the story. It's Anthony B. Jenkins and Percy Daggs IV that make you care the slightest about the come of things. They may be young, and I wouldn't call this their strongest performance, but they have lots of potential as actors.The music is pretty top notch for creating the fear and tension. It knows how to elevate the visuals in ways that seeing things alone won't help. Though the cinematography is good in creating that tension and unknown as well.I would watch this again because it gave me the heebie jeebies just enough to feel frightened at times, but I wasn't overly unsettled that I couldn't see an outcome a mile away. There's a terrific score that trumps everything and enhances the story. While the ending is kind of anti-climatic it was acceptable for me and I didn't hate myself for sitting through the film.That's it for now. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Happy watching and enjoy the show!",

I'm still reeling from that experience and figured I'd need a few days to cleanse my pallet back to average movie expectations. But it turns out this is pretty awesome too.I went in knowing zero about the movie and was treated to a pretty interesting premise and execution. Halle Berry gives a great performance, as do both of the child actors, especially the one playing Nolan.I spent most of the runtime feeling so conflicted about each of the three characters. The movie toys with you, keeping you guessing and wondering. There are some good horror moments and effective jump scares. And every time I felt like, \"It's good, not great,\" it would hit me with a powerful scene that made me think, \"No, it's great.\"Overall I think most horror fans will have a good time with this one.(1 viewing, opening Thursday 9\/19\/2024)",

The VFX and Makeup work was done well. The background score was impactful though. However, i like the fact the film plays mindgames with the audience which i liked alot.

        "body":"My daughter and I watched Never Let Go (2024) in theaters this evening. The storyline follows a post-apocalyptic world where a mother and her two sons survive off the land. The world is overrun by evil, but they've found a way to ground themselves to mother Earth using ropes, which keeps them safe. However, as the youngest son begins to doubt his mother, he may open the door just enough for evil to creep in and threaten their family-or maybe he's right to doubt her.This film is directed by Alexandre Aja (High Tension) and stars Halle Berry (Swordfish), Anthony B. Jenkins (The Deliverance), William Catlett (Abigail), and Percy Daggs IV (Undone).While the movie feels familiar in its post-apocalyptic themes, the characters and their dynamics are engaging enough to keep you invested. The acting is excellent-Berry delivers a powerful and authentic performance, and the child actors exceeded expectations with impressive performances. The relationship between the brothers was especially well done, and Berry's ghost stories added depth. The horror elements worked well, with the evil portrayed effectively and the makeup impressively done. The mystery of \"what's really going on\" keeps you guessing until the end. Highlights include the intense flower house scene and the transformation sequences, which were horror standouts. The ending was a lot of fun too.In conclusion, Never Let Go doesn't introduce anything groundbreaking to the horror genre, but it's still an entertaining and enjoyable watch. I'd score it a 6.5\/10 and recommend waiting until it hits streaming services.",

        "body":"**Movie Review: \"Never Let Go\"**\"Never Let Go,\" directed by Alexandre Aja, is a thriller that centers around a mother's relentless fight for survival with her two young children in a dense, eerie forest. The premise is intriguing: a rope serves as the family's lifeline, tethering them together and protecting them from the malevolent forces lurking in the woods. If the rope breaks, the evil forces will hunt them. This concept adds a layer of psychological tension to the survival-horror genre.Halle Berry, who plays the mother, delivers a solid performance, portraying a woman teetering between love for her children and the overwhelming fear of the unknown. The two young actors, Percy Dagg IV and Anthony B. Jenkins, stand out as her sons, bringing a mix of innocence and terror to their roles. Their interactions with Berry are heartfelt, emphasizing the emotional weight of a mother's love.The film excels in creating an oppressive atmosphere, with certain scenes designed to heighten anxiety and dread. There are moments of genuine tension, particularly when the family is navigating the dangers of the forest, always wary of what may be lurking nearby. However, some of the scares rely on familiar horror tropes, with a few jump-scares feeling predictable.What makes \"Never Let Go\" particularly interesting is the ambiguity surrounding the source of the threat. Is there truly something evil in the forest, or is the mother suffering from a mental breakdown, trapping her children in her own psychosis? This uncertainty keeps the audience guessing, although it can also be frustrating for viewers hoping for more definitive answers.The film's biggest strength lies in its performances, especially from Berry and the young actors. Berry's portrayal of a protective yet fragile mother is compelling, and her dynamic with her sons gives the film its emotional core. Even though some of the storytelling falters and certain plot points feel underdeveloped, the commitment of the cast keeps the audience engaged.Overall, \"Never Let Go\" is a well-acted, anxiety-filled ride that plays with the psychological horror genre. It may not fully satisfy those seeking a tightly-woven narrative or profound scares, but its exploration of motherhood, fear, and survival is gripping enough to make it worth a watch. Fans of Halle Berry and atmospheric horror will likely find something to appreciate here, even if the film falls short in other areas.",

All in all it's a mixed bag the person that I watched it with thought it was completely stupid and didn't like it at all but I thought that some of the psychological terrors and the horror associated with the possibilities in this movie made it nothing shortof a trip.",

It was generally entertaining enough but certainly nothing special.The core of the concept was intriguing and a good jumping off point, however the writers felt really noncommittal to what was happening. I understand instilling a sense of confusion and doubt, leaving the watcher questioning what the truth is. However, there was something about the way it was done here that felt like the writers almost didn't know which direction they wanted to take.Halle Berry's performance wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't bad by any means and the children did a good job. There was also something visually about most of the scary aspects of this movie that felt oddly a bit silly throughout.Overall I thought this landed at a \"fine\" but not something I would strongly recommend and urge someone to run out and see.",

        "body":"I just finished watching Alexandre Aja's newest movie, Never Let Go (2024), and I liked it a lot.Positives for Never Let Go (2024):\nFirst off, the movie's premise is very intriguing and I was engaged throughout the runtime. I tend to enjoy these Cabin in the Woods type horror movies a lot and this was another hit in that subgenre. Halle Berry does a fantastic job as the mother in this movie, then again I knew she would be great given this woman is an Academy Award winner. I also thought the two boys were also very good in this movie. And finally, the movie does a great job at asking you whether or not what you are seeing is real or if the character are losing their mind.Mixed for Never Let Go (2024):\nThere is something that happens in this movie will definitely catch your off guard and I appreciated this direction. However, there are going to some people who will be turned off by this decision.Negatives for Never Let Go (2024):\nI really didn't like one of the sons in this movie. Now to be fair, this kid does a great job with his performance in this movie, but I couldn't stand his character. There are certain things that kid does or says to other characters that made me very angry and annoyed with his character.Overall, I have a great time with Never Let Go (2024) and while it's not one of Alexandre Aja's best movies, I would still recommend this to anyone if you are a fan of Alexander Aja.",

        "body":"This was a film that popped on to my radar I'm guessing through trailers at the theater. I don't watch them, as you may know, but I will look up at the screen and then figure out the name of what is being shown to see if it is horror. This one didn't come to the theater that I'm a member at, but I had a cheap trial to get MoviePass back. I decided to see this at the theater close to my house. What sealed me seeing this was realizing that this is the new film from Alexandre Aja, a director I'm a fan of.Synopsis: a family that has been haunted by an evil spirit for years. Their safety and their surroundings come into question when one of the children questions if the evil is real.We start this with an effective opening scene to get your attention. This follows a mother, played by Halle Berry, and her two sons, Samuel (Anthony B. Jenkins) and Nolan (Percy Daggs IV). They live in a cabin in the middle of the woods. We can see that it is weathered but built well. Food is scarce so they try to grow what they can and scavenge for the rest. Winter is coming as well. This is a problem though, like the synopsis says, mother raised them to fear the evil that lives in the forest surrounding them.To stave this off, they must stay tied to the house. It seems to have been blessed so if they are connected to it, the house protects them. This limits how far they can go and they must be strategic in how they use their slack. Their mother is almost touched by an entity and we also see her talk to the father of the children, he is played by William Catlett. He wants to see his boys. She believes he's possessed by the evil.There is a dynamic that I need to bring up here. Samuel listens to mother more and he scolds his brother. This is building resentment where Nolan thinks that she loves his brother more than him. Nolan is like his mother growing up as he's defiant. He questions if there is something truly in the woods, holding them there. This causes him to assess his boundaries. This also leads him to be scolded by her and his brother.The first stressful part is when Nolan thinks he hear his brother say that their mother loves him more under his breath. He then steps on Samuel's rope, tripping him and causing it to untie. He hurt his ankle in the process. Nolan blows his whistle to alert their mother. She comes to help and Nolan has removed his rope to help his brother. She then sees the evil after them, taking the form of her mother. They can't see if though. They get back to safety. She needs them to prove that they weren't touched by praying to the house, which should reveal if they've been possessed.This is just the start of Nolan continuing to press his mother about what she claims. He doesn't believe and she is worried it will jeopardize their existence forever.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start then is that this is using a similar story that we've seen before. What I like here though is that we're playing with expectations and knowing if we can trust someone we love. This felt in the vein of It Comes at Night or even this year's Arcadian. Did the world end like mother is claiming? Or is she being overprotective to keep her children alive?I think that is where I want to start is with our mother character. Berry is great, I want to lead off with that. You can feel that she loves both of her sons. She is also doing what she think is right in protecting them. She does favor Samuel, but I get the idea that he's more obedient. I don't think she loves him more. It is just that she doesn't scold him like she does Nolan. She also sees more of herself in this other boy and it stresses her with their situation. Something that we will learn is that her mother was hard on her so she fled to the city. It is here where she met evil.Now I want to continue this idea but needed to separate it here. This film leaves it up to the viewer to decide if you think there is an evil around them or did something happened to the mother character so she is isolating her sons to protect them. The boys don't see the evil, it is only her. That would be a red flag where I'd side with Nolan. There is this idea that she's been touched by it where the boys are still innocent. That makes me think you need to have faith in what she's saying. It isn't until later that they start to see, but they've suffered trauma. There is a concept here of how life experience takes away that innocence, mother has fled to a safe place and now is sheltering them. I'll end this section by saying, as a parent, this is a difficult thing. You want to protect your children, but they also need to experience things for themselves. How far do you go with this balance?I did want to include what I thought here as well. I'll also credit the story and how it is presented because I went back and forth. Things we see in the beginning made me think there was an evil that mother is protecting her family from. Then for a good part, I'm with Nolan. I thought that she was shielding them from the world. In the end, I believe there is an evil here, but I fall into the middle. I think this evil is society and how trauma corrupts us to become who we are.Since this is truly a character study and how their world influences them, that is where I'll go next. I've already said that I thought Berry was great here. She seems like this stern mother doing what she can while being calculated by Nolan. Jenkins and Daggs are both fine. They fit what was needed to be these two sheltered boys that are trying to figure out their place in the world. It is limited due to their life situation. I do like Catlett, Matthew Kevin Anderson, Stephanie Lavigne, Cadence Compton and Mila Morgan as these potential corrupting forces. That is good to challenge what they think. The performances fit to bring their characters to life.All that is left then is filmmaking. The best part of this is the isolation of this cabin. We see that it is in the middle of the woods. It is a hike to a road, but even then, they only have enough rope to get to its edge. They feel like they're trapped in the middle of nowhere. Winter is coming and they're limited in food available. That raises tension. It also makes me side with Nolan in the what-if mother is lying. I'll also credit framing here. Shifting to the effects, when they're done practical, they look good. The blood and look of wounds were solid. There is CGI here. Since we don't know if what we're seeing is real, I'm more forgiving there. Other than that, the music and sound design was good. It adds creepiness with the latter when it comes to the voice of those possessed by the 'evil'. They also say hurtful things that adds to the atmosphere.In conclusion, this is a solid film that I'm glad that I checked out. The best part of this is the set up and seeing how these characters decide what to do. I can see the side of the mother, having the faith she does and protecting her children. There's also Nolan, who needs to see to believe. Berry is great as the mother while Jenkins and Daggs are solid as those effected by her decisions. This is well made. The setting, cinematography, framing, practical effects and sound design leading the way there. I don't think this is a great film, but it is worth a watch if you like stories like this or your fan of the director.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",

It reminded me a little bit of Birdbox and the fact that there is an R-rating got me even more excited. Now that I watched it I have to say that I am overall unsatisfied. The movie is not terribly bad however I feel like it leaves the audience starving for more. I didn't get to see enough of this world and of the threat. For a setup that was this interesting the movie was somehow rather boring at times. You have some of the typical clichés and stupid decisions that you will find in pretty much every horror movie, however the characters feel relatable and are very well acted. Especially the two young actors do a great job at their characters and they are given lots of screen time which was nice to see.Obviously the question about the movie is if Halle Berry's character is lying to their kids or if there's actual evil out in these woods that can only get them if they untie their rope. This question does get answered at the end however I still felt very displeased when the end credits started rolling. The third act picks up the pace and creates a rather enjoyable atmosphere but the final result was still rather disappointing. [5,5\/10]",

Open-ended mysteries that blend hallucinations and genuine horrors need consistent rules, but this film bends them too often, leaving you unable to piece together the story. While a few loose ends or a twist would be fine, this film is all loose ends. With a semi-coherent plot, the acting and occasional scares are left to carry the movie. Despite solid makeup and effects, the few monster encounters are overshadowed by heavy drama, similar to It Comes at Night but without its cohesive plot or themes.",

        "body":"With \"Never Let Go's\" UK release still a week away, I went to Cineworld's 'Secret Screaming' last night reasonably sure that this would be the film. I have mixed feelings about a film that has some great successes, particularly with the performances, but perhaps collapses towards the end from a surfeit of ideas and allegories.In a remote woodland area, Momma (Halle Berry) is raising her twin sons, Nolan (Percy Daggs IV) and Samuel (Anthony B. Jenkins) at their family's cabin. She has indoctrinated the boys to believe that there is an infectious evil, that only she can see, which has killed the rest of the world, and their only protection is the cabin, which the evil can't touch. This protection can be extended provided they are touching a length of rope, attached to the house's foundations, which allows them to do some rudimentary gardening, hunting, and gathering. The situation is becoming desperate though, as the winter has been harsh, and the food supplies are running critically low.The performances, from all three of the main cast are exception. The kids especially are both excellent and when, in the second half of the film, they're forced to carry more of the film - their nuanced and touching turns are excellent. The special effect work is usually well done (though not perhaps always) and there are some effective jump scares in the early parts of the film. Then it's all about the oppressive tension of whether the evil is real, or it's all in Momma's head and she could snap at any moment.Perhaps inevitably, that tension ebbs away as the film reaches its conclusion. It's really tough to talk about why and keep the review spoiler free but hedging its bets, when it comes to making a decision about what's really going on, undercut my interest and perhaps enjoyment of the last act. There are also a lot of interpretations that you can make into the subtext of the film. There's a clear religious aspect - a serpentine villain, faith in seemingly random doctrine; mental illness, isolation, even parenting in general are all factors - but it feels more like it plays lip service to them, whereas engaging properly with one would have been a better way to go.I like Alexandre Aja's film and am often a staunch defender of \"Haute Tension\", I can't see me rushing back to this one though.",

The truth is, that directors are not always knowing what they want to tell. My guess is that there was no point to the story. Just creating the ambiance, some scary stuff and let us know that evil wonders around among us, so there is always a reason to make more horror movies. I guess this is one of the movies that had the beginning, it seemed promising, they started filming it and putting it mildly, the story went wondering in the woods. Very scary.",

The storyline does a good job of keeping you guessing as the viewer as to what is real and what is not.

The only safety can be found in their home. They must scrounge for supplies and hunt for anything to eat in the woods, but only if they tie themselves to their home with very long ropes. As supplies dwindle, the situation spirals downwards.This has an interesting idea. I think everybody assumes that Halle Berry is hallucinating. That does make the first half rather slow and repetitive. We get it. She sees dead people. Maybe the movie should not show them. It needs to condense that part and bring the dog situation forward. That's when the story truly launches. There are some compelling tension in the second half. The ending gets wacky, but that's not unexpected.",

        "body":"Never Let Go is a survival horror thriller that presents an intriguing premise but falters in execution due to uneven pacing and underdeveloped characters. Directed by Alexandre Aja, the film stars Halle Berry as a mother, referred to as \"Momma,\" battling a malevolent supernatural force while confronting her own psychological unraveling. Despite Berry's committed and nuanced performance, the film struggles to maintain consistent tension and fails to deliver a resonant emotional impact.The narrative follows a mother trapped in an isolated cabin with her two young sons, portrayed by Percy Daggs IV and Anthony B. Jenkins. The supernatural force targets her exclusively, leading her family to question her sanity as her paranoia escalates. Attempting to blend psychological and supernatural horror, the film explores themes of maternal fear, isolation, and distorted perception. However, the execution is inconsistent. The pacing meanders, and the supernatural elements lack coherence. Ambiguity, often a hallmark of effective horror, feels underdeveloped here, leaving key moments unfulfilled rather than suspenseful.Halle Berry anchors the film with a powerful performance, convincingly portraying a mother's desperation to protect her children while questioning her grip on reality. Her portrayal of psychological fragility and determination is both compelling and heartfelt. However, the supporting cast lacks the same depth. Daggs and Jenkins deliver adequate performances but are constrained by shallow characterisation, which diminishes the emotional stakes. Their dynamic with Berry, a potential source of rich tension, remains underexplored.Alexandre Aja, known for his mastery of high-intensity horror in films such as The Hills Have Eyes and High Tension, struggles to replicate that same energy. The remote cabin setting provides an ideal backdrop for claustrophobic horror, yet the cinematography fails to fully exploit its potential. The supernatural antagonist, while initially unsettling, becomes less effective as the film leans on predictable tropes. The climax, intended to be a harrowing crescendo, descends into chaotic overindulgence, resulting in a rushed and unsatisfying conclusion.Critics have offered mixed reviews. While Berry's performance has received widespread acclaim, the film has been criticised for its reliance on clichés and lack of originality. The Guardian described it as \"a film that flirts with greatness but settles for mediocrity,\" while Empire lamented its \"missed opportunity to deliver a truly chilling psychological horror.\"In summary, Never Let Go is a film that flashes glimpses of potential but ultimately stumbles in its execution. Halle Berry's exceptional performance provides the emotional core, but predictable scares, thin characterisation, and an uneven narrative undermine the impact. While it may appeal to fans of straightforward supernatural thrillers, it lacks the depth and innovation required to leave a lasting impression. A missed opportunity that struggles to rise above its own ambition.",

        "body":"At first glance, Never Let Go appears to be the story of Halle Berry (simply referred to as Mother) and her attempts to keep her two boys safe in a post apocalyptic world where evil stalks the woods outside their family home. It is really, however the story of the boys, their bond and the choices they must make.Said boys are twins Samuel and Nolan (played by Anthony B. Jenkins and Percy Daggs IV respectively). They live in a wooden house that they are told by Mother they can never leave unless tied to a rope that anchors them to their home, the only thing keeping them safe from a great evil that has ravaged the rest of the world. Should they fail to heed her advice, the evil will enter them and gain access to the homestead where it will kill them all. The only one allowed to roam free of a tether is their faithful dog Coda (the evil has no interest in animals) and if there is any suspicion one of the boys' faith is wavering it's into a compartment in the floor with them, where they visualise the evil and pay thanks to the house. As accidents happen and a harsh winter makes their quest for food more and more desperate, Nolan begins to doubt their mother's stories while Samuel remains devoted.That's more or less it for story, a handful of events testing the family bonds and the three protagonists are the only real characters. The minimalist set up paves the way for an intimate story of creeping dread and a family unit under pressure. Director Alexandre Aja is a horror veteran with an up and down CV but he creates a fantastically grim atmosphere here, whether it's evil or simply starvation, you can feel the vice tightening on the trio. It helps that it's easy to get on board with the family. The child actors are a revelation, carrying the emotional weight of the roles easily, and Berry gives her all as the stern and troubled but clearly loving matriarch. It is a little distracting that the children don't share their mother's strong accent (who else did they learn to talk from?) but that's a minor quibble when the performances are this good.The script does struggle in a couple of places. It does it's best to add in some twists (and there is one shocking moment that comes out of the blue) but you will make your mind up fairly early on as to what is real and imagined and its unlikely you'll change your mind once you have. Stories like this are also tricky to satisfyingly wrap up and not everyone will be on board with the ending here.Never Let Go is far from the first film to mix horror and mental illness and it certainly isn't the best but it's a well acted and focused piece that will have you invested in two brothers beating ever increasing odds.7 tattoos from the before times out of 10.",

I guess that they wanted to build some kind of allegory of mental illness but couldn't keeep the mystery or even the audience interest past 20 minutes. After a few minutes the movie becomes a convoluted sequence of awful pointless scenes. Few times I've seen so many people abandon a theater. I appreciate the quest for something original but this movie missed the mark by a lot. It is probably the worst movie of the last few years. I wish I can unseen it. The two kids actors in the movie are good. Hope they can find a better project next time.",

        "body":"Never Let Go is a Shyamalan inspired horror that burns slowly and has a clean structure. The central mystery is engaging enough to sustain it even if the answer disappointingly proves both answers are right at the same time. It's a story of a parent wanting to protect their children from the dangers of the outside world but holding on too tightly with a solid psychological aspect and a couple of surprises inside of the familiar narrative.Halle Berry gives a very committed performance that's equal parts caring and intense throughout. Her performance is a big reason why this works as she sells the fear of the outside world whilst laying doubts about whether she's telling the truth. Anthony B. Jenkins and Percy Daggs IV are both really good, especially when the film heavily relies on them towards the end and Percy Daggs IV becomes an anchor for everything.Alexandre Aja's direction brings a potent atmosphere to the proceedings and crafts some good jolts throughout, including one particularly memorable and unsettling creation during the third act. The atmosphere is enhanced by the sound design which distorts natural sounds to create unease that starts in the very first scene and the score by Robin Coudert has a fittingly dark fairytale quality to it.",

The entire first half is just so run-of-the-mill, so slow, so uninteresting that you can't even imagine how the whole movie will be worthwhile. It does eventually (FINALLY) ramp up though, and the ending is actually quite good. It may not be what people want for an ending (which I think is probably the case), but it's a complete resolution to the plot. The movie is good, just be prepared to trudge through the beginning. It seems the writers were writing significantly outside of their own knowledge\/experience and, with a lack of anything to care about, you just sit there noticing all the stuff that doesn't work. If you've ever tried dragging rope even short distances, you know it gets caught on EVERYTHING. There's literally no way someone could carry a heavy rope behind them in the woods and get more than 50 feet. The children say things that they couldn't possibly come up with because they lack any frame of reference due to their isolation. Things like that.

But the aspect in which this movie really shines (like his ancestor) is in the characters, however this time the emotional weight is much more present,and the scale of both the drama and action is much bigger. Andrew and Emma were just as great as in the previous movie, and the chemistry between them is fantastic. Jaime Fox also nailed it as Electro, even thou the character itself was not the best written character, but his performance was so great that i was able to overcome the writing. Dane DeHann was equally great as the Green Goblin, at first i didn't like the idea of Harry being the Green Goblin instead of Norman Osborn, but it was a good choice and it matched perfectly with the plot and tone of the movie.(Also Dane has a knack for playing psychopaths) As to be expected there are plenty CGI scenes but it really didn't bother me because the action sequences were done in a very creative way. The Score, composed by Hans Zimmer,is amazing and somewhat contemporary, so it fits the themes of each character and moment. Overall the movie was much more intense and heavier than the first installment, as our main character deals not only with supernatural challenges but also emotional dilemmas.",

        "body":"I'm an unabashed die hard fan boy for Spider-Man. There I said it. You can call me a homer for anything Spider-Man. I wasn't a happy camper when I heard they were rebooting the films that I fell in love with. The first two Raimi films for me were great. The sequel still holding up today as one of the best superhero movies of all time. The first Amazing Spider-Man was a bit jarring for me. I walked out of the film not knowing what I thought about it. I enjoyed Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man but his Peter Parker didn't click with me. I also had some nit picky things about the film as a whole (Gwen instead of Mary Jane, lackluster villain). But watching the film a few more times I realized that I liked it.I do research on films that I'm excited for. This film came out weeks earlier in the UK and Europe. And the reviews were mixed which was sinking my high hopes. I didn't like the fact that there were three villains (More on that later). But it seemed like they were choosing the right actors for parts and surrounding the film in talent. After much heart and headache reading people thoughts and reviews for me, I'm okay with saying I liked much of this second Spider-Man film.Andrew Garfield is Spider-Man and it seems he's embraced the part much more this time than in the first film. His Spider-Man is having fun being the savior of the city. He's making the quips, the jokes and the all around energy of his Spider-Man feels directly out of the comic book. I am finally sold on his Peter Parker. Director Marc Webb finally lets the smart but dorky Parker shine in a few scenes that are hilarious and engaging.I'm still not an Emma Stone fan but she is a good counter to Garfield's Parker. They have excellent chemistry. You can tell that these may be Webb's favorite scenes to shoot. When they are on screen this huge summer tent pole film because a small drama about two people with a unique love story. The villains, there are three of them but not really. Let me explain. Rhino played basically as a cameo by Paul Giamatti is really only on screen to show Spider-Man in action at the beginning and end of the film. His main adversaries are Jamie Foxx's Electro who starts off as a man who is saved by Spider-Man. He then becomes a obsessed fan only to in perfect comic book fashion have a horrible accident that grants him superpowers. Foxx is okay, I wouldn't say he is awful. He has some good moments and contrary to what has been written I think he only has one cringe worthy line.Dane DeHaan is one of if not my favorite actor working this moment. His method style works so well in many of the films he's in and here it's perfect. His Harry Osborn is less cartoon-y than James Franco's from previous films. He's creepy, spoiled, arrogant but dealt with a lot of adversity. His chemistry with Garfield feels genuine. It doesn't feel forced like it could have been. They are long time friends who have been distant but because of new circumstances are forced back together.The action is fun, fast and so Spider-Man if that means anything. The way they use his spider sense was very cool. I want to see more of that. The small nods to the comic book are fantastic. There are nods here and there to the upcoming sinister six film which doesn't cloud the film. It's just there in the story that this is apart of a large story in the future. I was trying to count the nods to the comic books. The only issues I had with the film was Peter's search for what happen to his father was kind of just there to fill time. Also the great Sally Field as Aunt May got only a few scenes. She was great on screen but mostly wasted.Because this film is dividing fans I think I've pinpointed the problem. I'm a fan of the comic books and this film feel like a few issues of the comic books aka a mini-series. There are multiple stories, with multiple villains and a lot going on. I'm okay with the finally product and eager to see the film again. For Garfield's performance, the chemistry with Stone and the action scenes this film is a fun ride for any fan of the neighborhood web shooter.",

Really good job by the actors here. And with that SuperVillian : 'Electro', the movie becomes one of the best SuperHero movies. Visual effects are quite good and the movie is perfectly entertaining.

        "body":"\"Let's go catch a spider.\"Marc Webb's first feature film, 500 Days of Summer, was a successful small indie romantic film with a lot of heart. He went from that to the huge production of the Spider-Man franchise which I thought didn't necessarily need a reboot so soon. However the film did work thanks to Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Peter Parker. His natural charisma and confidence translated really well to the character and his sense of humor makes him the perfect candidate to play Spier-Man. I began my review by mentioning that Webb directed 500 Days of Summer because for me the heart and soul of this film is the love story between Gwen and Peter. I can't think of any other superhero film with such a great love story and believable chemistry than this one. Garfield and Emma Stone are incredible together and I loved their scenes. Webb knows a thing or two about young romance and it is the film's strongest asset. The sequel is entertaining and has some great action scenes, but I could've watched this film for the romance alone. The flaws are actually the villains in this film. They don't crowd the film like the trailers led me to believe, but they really don't seem to menacing until we reach the final third act. For a film that runs at 140 minutes it went by really quick and that is always a good sign. Spider-Man 2 might not be as good as this year's Captain America, but it does have its solid moments and clever one-liners. At times the CGI took me out of the film as it looked more like a video game, but there were some interesting shots as we got to follow Spider-Man swing across the New York City landscape. The film works better as a romantic comedy than an actual superhero movie but that was fine with me because it was a really good one. It makes most other recent rom-coms look ridiculous and unbelievable.After a short flashback where we see what happened with Peter's parents, the camera follows Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield) swinging across NYC as he tries to stop a Russian mob criminal, Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti), who has stolen something from OsCorp. In the midst of all the action he receives a call from his girlfriend, Gwen (Emma Stone), who is reminding him that he's going to be late for their graduation. Somehow Spider-Man manages to take care of business and arrives in the nick of time to receive his degree as Peter Parker. His Aunt May (Sally Field) is the only family he has left, but she's there for him like she's always been. Peter however has been having visions of Gwen's father reminding him of the promise he made to not date his daughter in order to keep her out of danger. Apparently it has been a conflict they've dealt with over the last few months and Gwen decides it's time for the two to break up. Gwen continues to work at OsCorp which is now managed by Norman's son, Harry (Dane DeHaan), after his passing. Harry seems to suffer from the same degenerative disease of his father and wants to continue researching for a cure in OsCorp. Peter is glad to see his childhood friend back, but when he realizes what he's up to things get complicated. When an employee from OsCorp suffers a freak accident he becomes Electro (Jamie Foxx), a dangerous foe for Spider-Man and the city.The Amazing Spider-Man has some flaws but it still entertains thanks to the great chemistry between Stone and Garfield. They are perfect together. DeHaan is also great as Harry and he does look like a believable threat for Spider-Man. I had a problem with Foxx's clumsy performance as Max but once he becomes Electro he does look menacing. I didn't care too much about the villains or the action set pieces despite the fact that they were well crafted. The inner struggles that Peter Parker faces with his family drama and relationship with Gwen is at the heart of this film. The final act is more than just a gigantic action face-off, there is actually a lot of emotional elements at stake and that is what lifted this movie as it finished on a high note. There was a very emotional scene scene near the end of the film that left the entire theater in silence. The best thing about this sequel is that it was much more emotionally involving than the original and it banks its strength from Andrew Garfield's charismatic and spot on performance as Peter Parker.",

On the other hand those who love comic spidey, loved, for all the stupid puns, the charisma and the of course the action. But the main complain is about the script, but understanding as a comic adaptation, it makes sense, the several sub-plots going on between each fight,the preface and Peter Parker\/Spider-Man parallels objectives, it makes just like a regular comic (weekly or monthly) and less like a regular movie.But What can I say, I was expecting to see the real (mental image, again) Spider-Man on screen, the costume is really (a lot of emphasis here) beautiful, Andrew Garfield really is in the character, Emma Stone makes an active love interest, Dane DeHaan makes a 'realistic' Green Goblin and Paul Giamatti goes a over-the-top, more related to an usual Spider-Man Villain. The only big flaw is Jamie Foxx getting the spotlight just because Django, the character is lost in the movie, half-way between fun villain and real threat, shame because he is the main villain.Marc Webb got me, I'm gonna be the first in line for: The Amazing Spider-Man 3, Venom-Carnage, Sinister Six, maybe Spider-Woman (not confirmed yet), or any other release of a fun comic adaptation.",

        "body":"Lets give a disclaimer here: I am a comic book nerd-geek and Spider-Man is one of my favorite fictional characters ever, so maybe I am inclined to be fully absorbed by this movie very easily, yet this doesn't take away from my film nerd-fan side that genuinely thought very highly of this film from a simple filmaking point of view. As storytelling goes I was very-pleasantly surprised to find a really strong grip: it never commits the Spider-Man 3 mistake of being over-crowded and maintains a brilliant balance on all the characters flowing naturally with a story that feels perfectly fine despite the pressure it had from Sony. It never tries to be over intricate but manages to pull of multiple inter-twining story lines in a magnificent way. Never does it leave loose ends and that is something I hadn't seen in a comic-book movie for a couple of years. Furthermore it isn't a banal plot, there of course are some clichéd moments but as much as they don't get me in 90% of movies they got me here (credit to director\/actors for making those few feel very spontaneous), it has valid originality and keeps a core fidelity to the source material that deserves high praise. Just as good is the way in which this sequel builds on its predecessor tying up loose ends, proceeding with minor story lines of the first movie and adding great parts in it. As a director Webb proves to be amazing. The action scenes are complexly put together, with visual brilliance and continuity in them. Great improvement from the first movie. They really were breathtaking, nail-biting sequences that found me on the edge of my seat continuously. Another visual aspect that is stunning is the swinging sequences of Spider-Man: this is what I always wanted to see but never fully experienced with the other Spider-Man movies; the shots there were fantastic. Yet what I most admire Webb for is the talent he has for character development and coherence, we have seen this in his previous two movies and here it is firing once again in all cylinders. There just isn't one character in whom I did not believe, I never spotted the stereotypical comic-book person in here. Everybody had there chance to shine. Sure a couple of characters have minor short-comings and I understand if somebody doesn't believe in Electro's personality, but I found that it walked the line between movie acceptability and comic-book campyness in the perfect dose. To this I also have to give credit to the soundtrack which blew me totally away when Electro is introduced to the public: that was some serious use of music and sounds for storytelling, brilliant, intelligent! Adding to this is a really powerful score from Hans Zimmer, one of the better ones I have heard from him and generally in recent years. Our introduction to Harry Osborn\/Green Goblin was positive on the character part (indeed there was no need for him to be green goblin in this one but I honestly did not mind him), yet from an acting point of view I think Dane Dehaan overacted in some scenes, nevertheless he was good enough. There have been many criticisms of this movie in regards to messy tone, unoriginality and rushed villains and as much as I see where people are coming from and I would indeed have appreciated a more untraditional villain(s) introduction and story I just never thought of that during the movie: there are many movies in which I simply cannot be taken in because of originality issues, but for some reason this one felt to me so fluent I never had any problems with this and actually felt it kept a consistent tone throughout. Yet I must address the fact that watching it twice I could feel the studio putting too much of its hand in the movie: they were way to manipulative of this and I think that by leaving Marc Webb just some more creative power this movie could have been enormously better. The CGI wasn't always seamless but great in many moments and anyways it never bothered me because the story was always the driving force behind it and what I was most interested in: this also speaks to the fact that the action was used to propel the plot so it never felt out of place, that is something really hard to pull off. There is lots of humor in the film and I can safely say that it actually is very funny and very faithful to who Spider-Man is and how he acts and to expand on this the humor fits both the tone of the movie and the storytelling, speaking again to the fact that, just like the action, it is used appropriately for the character development or the story, it is never gratuitous. I was excepting more fan service, but I can't really fault the movie for not satisfying my unsatisfiable thirst for it, that was nevertheless kept at bay. \"The Amazing Spiderman 2\" truly was a comic book movie. It took the best aspects of the two world and combined them in what I always figured in my head when I read Spider-Man comics. Yet, I have been holding back this for all my review and here it is: what truly is the best part of the movie, the most riveting element, the thing that Webb does best in a really majestical way, the driving force behind this film, the main reason and thing that kept me most absorbed in the drama and what gives it honest emotional depth is the relationship between Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker. honestly do not know how Webb is so amazingly good with romance and character interaction but what we have here (and in the previous movie) is something really special.",

I did enjoy the first installment of this unnecessary reboot, almost anything seemed like a step up from \"Spiderman 3\", and Garfield felt way more natural than Maguire, and Emma Stone is always welcome. But after seeing the first trailer I thought it seemed like a total mess, and I wasn't convinced by Electro one bit. Unfortunately I was spot on, I hoped to at least get an enjoyable time at the cinema with my friends, but ended up feeling quite uncomfortable and laughing throughout most of the film. Garfield and Stone has their chemistry and does their best with the incredibly thin script and cheesy one-liners, but their potential quite beautiful scenes together gets lost in the over-full and messy plot. I can't buy an emotional scene that is interrupted by heavy dub-step and a blue electric guy.Oh Jamie Foxx, how did you go from Django to this? Before he goes all CGI-Electro he tries to play the nerdy unseen scientist (with a worse comb-over than Christian Bale's 'Hustle'-look). As Electro it's hard to say how much is his fault, and what can be blamed on the rest, I'd go with the rest. You don't sympathize with him nor do you believe how fast he becomes this super-villain. Everything that Dane DeHaan did so well in \"Chronicle\" just feels unnatural and (maybe not misplaced, but wrong) here. And his character development is way too rushed and quite unnecessary for this film, it just becomes another sub-plot standing in the way of what really matters. Sally Field does good work as Aunt May, but leaves no lasting mark. Paul Giamatti's Russian criminal is just in the way and only gives a couple of dreadful and laughable scenes. And then there's the mad German scientist named Kafka and I rest my case. The action and visuals isn't bad, but still doesn't make up for the low \"trying to be Marvel\"-comedy and horrific soundtrack, a soundtrack that almost itself destroys the film throughout the exhausting 142 minutes. And sometimes it feels like the movie is taking us as an audience to be stupid, with pointers to what is going to happen. I would like to say that you might enjoy it if you just try and see it for what it is, but it's hard, but hopefully possible! It had an interesting start, with a glimpse inside the past and Peter's parents, but it's left underdeveloped, as is almost everything else, to make room for all its action and villains.It's amazing how the difference between two big-budget superhero-movies can be so huge, if you put this against \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\", a great and, opposed to this one, original film. Oh how I wish that Marc Webb could have continued with a \"(500) Days of Summer\"-esque movie instead, he could keep the sub-plots starring Garfield, Stone and DeHaan, and it could very well be a great film, and probably not such a waste of talent.",

I thought they should never have shown the rhino at the poster or trailer at all,instead they could surprise us spider man fighting rhino at the end. Overall solid film recommend everyone to watch it",

        "body":"Once again a good example about movie that critics don't like, but I enjoy to watch. Of course this isn't greatest movie of history, but as a comic book filming it is very entertaining. Spider-Man's leaps between skyscrapers are beautiful to watch especially in 3D experience is like sitting on a roller coaster. Andrew Garfield is great as a Spider-Man, Emma Stone succeed well as Spider-Man's girl friend despite the tragical end. Sally Field is always great actress. Only Jamie Foxx don't convince in his role as a nerd. Luckily he act nerd only half of the film and the rest of the movie he is digitally enhanced Electro. Story is entertaining and pretentious comic book adaption and that is the way it should been watch. Albeit the dialogue is quite childish at time to time it doesn't bother too much. Lots of popcorn and enough of soda is all you need to enjoy this movie. If you want to say something bad about the movie you could say it has been inflate to so big that it will be a hard to surpass on next movie. Movies massive budget (200 million dollars) is hard to cross over. On the other hand if movie makes enough profit as theatrical release couple of more millions should not be any infeasible to approve.http:\/\/tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi\/",

        "body":"Both Amazing Spider-Man films get a lot of hate, and while for me they weren't as bad as all that(if anything personally they were moderately enjoyable films) I do agree with a lot of the criticisms for both. Some say the sequel is better, personally the first while being very over-familiar and unevenly paced and with a severely underdeveloped villain the first was a little better but still fell far short. There are good things about the sequel. Once again it is very stylishly made and the special effects are better this time round, while the action sequences provide some thrills. The chemistry between Peter and Gwen is still sweet, Peter at the grave is actually quite moving and the closest the film ever gets to having any emotional impact and some of the acting is good. Andrew Garfield's performance is much better here, he doesn't ever quite capture Spider-Man's vulnerability but he is much less smug and tones down the quirkiness. Emma Stone is a charming and very likable Gwen, Sally Field gives seasoned support as Aunt May although she doesn't have much to do and Dane DeHaan does a great job showing Harry Osborn's slow descent into fear and loneliness. However, Jamie Foxx despite looking really cool doesn't do anything with Electro and looks lost and Paul Giamatti is completely wasted and gives a rare bad performance. The script and the way the characters are written don't help, the script is very thinly sketched and tries to balance comedy and pathos and does so awkwardly, to the extent the comedy feels overly-broad and out of place and the pathos apart from one part is non-existent literally. And the film does suffer from too many characters and most of them with little development, with the two leads the most interesting characters. There are two too many villains(the same problem that Spider-Man 3 had) and none of them developed very well, Osborn\/Green Goblin just about musters due to DeHaan but his development still feels rushed and some of his actions out of the blue, the villain also deserved a much better resurrection which was cheaply done. Like Lizard in the first film Electro is very one-dimensional with no motivation, or shall we say no obvious one, and Rhino feels like a just-there-for-the-sake-of-it character. The story doesn't suffer from being over-familiar like the first Amazing Spider-Man but it does suffer from a very sprawling structure and a lot of it feels over-stuffed and plodding. The music has its moments and does fit better than James Horner's for the first Amazing Spider Man but it does lack pace and one of those pleasant-to-listen-to-but-easily-forgettable scores, three composers are credited and the score sometimes sounds like that is the case. All in all, moderately enjoyable and visually impressive, and Garfield is much more at ease here, but it does suffer from trying to do too much and feels empty and emotionally-lacking. 5\/10 Bethany",

As you can tell I did not enjoy the first film very much I found it a average movie with a horrible villain and a re used narrative. However the second film in the series managed to reassure me that their is stall hope in this franchise. Marc Webb seems to have a better hold on the story he's trying to tell in this film and the relationship between Gwen and Peter is tremendous. Andrew Garfield shows us his acting shops throughout this movie and blows Toby Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker completely away. However the film with all the amazing things it does stall has some flaws. The villain's such as electro and rhino are very cheesy and unconvincingly acted which is very strange due to the actors who are very skilled that portray them. But Dane Dehaan as Harry Osbourne does a brilliant job reassuring his acting ability in Hollywood as he brings a memorable performance to his character. The film also sets up future movies and spinoffs perfectly with a large amount of Easter eggs scattered throughout. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a much better film then the first amazing Spider-Man and packs a huge emotional punch however a stilted narrative and a few wooden characters hold it back from its true potential. Hopefully future spidey films in this universe will solidify Spider-Man as one of the greats.",

It was such a good movie, and I wasn't even expecting it to be!Of course, I could be biased here, since I'm a bit of a spiderman fan (always have been, always will be), but this is my new favourite superhero movie! (my last one was Thor...go fig!)The visuals were brilliant, and the cgi was absolutely fantastic! The scenes with Electro were so impressive, I almost couldn't believe my eyes! The script was pretty good, and as always, Marc Webb's direction was impeccable, so no complaints on that front.Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone were on top form once again, and their chemistry was just mind blowing! How cute! Jamie Foxx did VERY well as Max Dillon\/Electro, making me feel sympathy for Max, and terrified of Electro! Chris Cooper...what can I say? His performance was short, sweet, and superb as always.Star player, however, simply has to go to Dane DeHann! He's been one of my favourite actors (along with Miles Teller, Jeremy Renner and Evan Peters) ever since I saw 'Lawless', and once again, he certainly didn't disappoint! His performance was my favourite aspect of the film! I don't mean to gush, but he played Harry with a mix of charming, funny, creepy and scary! Just...amazing!I laughed so much, I cried so hard, and I definitely wouldn't hesitate if asked to go see it again! Highly recommended.",

        "body":"A very entertaining and gripping mix between \"funny comic book superhero\" portrayal and heartwarming, serious emotions. This is by far the best Spiderman movie of the five. Right from the start you begin to realize how in this movie the action scenes are not executed in a dead-serious end of the world manner like the previous spider-man movies, which made me feel more connected to this movie than the others. This is how spider-man should have always been portrayed, unlike superman or batman. Andrew Garfield delivers the role in a very balanced and well done manner yet again. He had the chance to dive deeper into the role in this movie compared to the previous one. The chemistry between him and Emma stone on screen is one of the best aspects of this movie.Another thing I enjoyed about this movie were the villains, which surprisingly everyone seemed to dislike. The characters in the movie weren't too much in any way, certainly not as much as in the previous Spiderman 3.Even tho the movie didn't feel like it was something completely new, and doesn't seem to pull off something unexpected or revolutionary (In regards to film making, not Spiderman story-wise) I still felt like it was one of the most engaging and entertaining movies I have seen in a long time",

All the characters struggle against the system that has perpetuated falsehoods. The main characteristic of the film is the gloomy atmosphere, emphasizing the desolate hopelessness. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The acting is very effective. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. But it's a two-hour pile of destructive self-obsession.",

        "body":"Alright, I know I'm not the populist opinion here, so I'll go ahead and say what I think and try to articulate why I think this movie is probably the best Spider-man movie to date.First off, I don't like the Raimi films, I tried my absolute best to tolerate the ridiculous cheese, underacting (McGuire and Dunst) and overacting (Pretty much everyone else) the hoaky writing, the plot holes, the weird character motivations, but I couldn't. I feel that everyone who compares the new Amazing flicks to the Raimi trilogy misses the point of a reboot, its not supposed to be like the old movies, that's the idea.First off, its undeniable that Garfield far outshines McGuire as an actor, and as Spider-man. Not only that, but even without the comparison, he manages to play a likable and natural High-Schooler (Despite the fact that he looks like he's in college) Emma Stone, well, she almost makes the movie. Marc Webb can definitely write chemistry between characters well, and with Gwen and Peter, it really shines. I genuinely cared about the romance in both movies, which I could not say for the old films. The other actors are all solid, Jamie Foxx is a great actor, and while his part is not original, it is entertaining and well acted. Props also to Dane Dehaan, who is a great actor and a fantastic Harry Osbourne. Is this movie the mess of a plot everyone says it is? Not really. I was never confused or befuddled by the absurdity of the plot or situation at hand. However, the only thing I can honestly fault on the film can be Sony's marketing. Putting the Rhino in the trailers was idiotic considering he's in two scenes, and yes, the film feels like its fulfilling a quota of things to do with its plot, but here's the catch: its entertaining. The characters are fun to watch, the story keeps true to the Ultimate Spiderman mythos, and it genuinely makes you care for everyone you are supposed to care for. This, in my opinion is the best Spiderman movie we've had, its enjoyable, exciting, heartfelt, and a very well-written film, but Sony's meddling is very evident.",

This movie has action, comedy and drama in a perfect balance. I was worried that there would be too many bad guys in this movie, but they did it just right. If I had one complaint, it would be that Harry Osborne's transition to the Green Goblin could have been done differently, it felt a bit rushed to me, but the rest of the movie makes up for it. Another highlight for me was the soundtrack and score of the movie. The music when Electro is in Times Square is amazingly well done.Overall I liked this movie a lot because it really felt like the Spider-Man I knew from the comics. There was a mid credits scene of the X-Men: Days of Future Past movie, but I really didn't like that scene.",

Electro is probably the best Spider-Man villain, not in terms of characterization, but in terms of coolness and power. That last fight scene was so dope with the electricity that made all the music. Blue is a great color for Electro. He is also very powerful, and he definitely could have done more than in the movie.Andrew Garfield again brought charisma to the our favorite local superhero. And just like in the first, Peter and Gwen had such amazing charm and chemistry, only because of the actors.My problem is although they revealed more about Peter's parents, it kinda led to nothing. I was quite disappointed in that. Then, Harry Osborn was pretty boring and just rushed.Overall, it was just slightly better than the other Spider-Man (of course not even close to Spider-Man 2) because of a cooler villain. 7.5\/10.",

        "body":"\"The Amazing Spider-man 2\" is a tough one. A Movie I can't actually figure out whether I liked or not. Parts of it were actually amazing. While other parts were far from it.I Think the main problem with this second Spider-man movie (Or is it fifth Spider-man movie?) is that the film before it still feels like a re-run. Yes, as good as \"The Amazing Spider-man\" was. It still felt over-shadowed by three previous movies that didn't really deserve to get ignored. I left that one thinking \"Oh well, at least they've got the setting up out of the way, and can get on with doing something different in the next one.\" Trouble is, they haven't. This one also spends most of its time setting up future movies. While other parts bring nothing new and feel like more repeats. I mean, wasn't that \"Washing machine\" gag done in the other \"Spider-man 2?\" The biggest mistake \"The Amazing Spider-man 2\" makes though. Is one that this series should already have learnt not to do. And that's under-using its villain. The main bad guy off this one is suppose to be Electro. A Bad-guy that was always going to be a tough sell, and they don't quite manage it. In the Cartoons he looks so ridiculous that they've had to entirely redesign him, which is cool. But the character is ruined after an amazing intro by being under-used yet over done.The \"Real\" main villain of the movie is Harry Osborne (Dane DeHann) and although this is one of the things that has been done before, he is arguably the best thing in the movie. The minute DeHann was cast I knew he would be great, and he is. His \"dual identity\" too, has been redesigned, but for the better. With a new take, that makes the future of the series at least look promising.But what about this movie? It likes building up future ideas, but there must be something else good about it by itself? Well, Andrew Garfield is still pleasing fans as Spider-man, and his chemistry with Emma Stone is still strong. Providing the movie with most of its laughs, charm, and in some parts, genuine tears. But we watch Spider-man for the action, right? And most of the action too, is still cool. Even if the series has far from reinvented itself, and is still spending a bit too much time on Spider-man's love life, than his crime fighting.",

        "body":"Spider-Man's film franchise has always been a bumpy road with Sony Pictures. The Sam Raimi trilogy for the most part revitalised the Superhero genre that was stuck in the mud with the abysmal Batman and Robin. The first Spidey outing changed the genre around and managed to get fans interested in the characters and the storyline once again. The sequel improved with a more complex villain and better character development. However, fans lost faith with the threequel and Spidey's future was stuck to one huge tangle of a web.Then along came Marc Webb, with The Amazing Spider-Man which was shrugged off by the critics and called a cash grab. However, whatever criticisms there have been of the previous four films this one seems devoid of all of them and gives fans what they have longed for; an exciting, mesmerising and pulse- pounding adventure one that stays true to the comics.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a jam packed film and every shot has been thoroughly examined and expertly directed by Marc Webb. The effects are the best that they have ever looked, the characters are fully developed and we care more than we ever have done about them all and the action and story threads are not all over the place. The beauty of TASM 2 lies in the fact that the origins of Spidey have been set up and he is free to roam this spectacularly created world.It is fair to say that there has not been much hype surrounding this superhero sequel and going in with high but not extreme expectations it blew them out of the park so effortlessly I was left gob-smacked. This leaves us with undoubtedly a Superhero for the ages and the best outing for any standalone character since The Dark Knight Rises.The score composed by Hans Zimmer shows off his mastery of the Superhero genre of music and his themes for Spidey, Electro and Goblin are always enthralling and only add to the burst of colour and energy that we receive on screen. Here's to hoping he can stay on as he proves himself a worthy heir to Danny Elfman's Spidey scores.Furthermore, the story threads are balanced with ease and that is not a small task to be had. There are three villains; Electro, the Green Goblin and the Rhino. The rhino played with a maniac twist by Paul Giamatti relishes the short screen time he gets and leaves us longing for more (which will come with TASM 3). The goblin (Dane DeHaan) gives a better performance than the campy version we got with Willem Dafoe in 2002. He brings menace and I was shaken up when we hear his manic cackle from afar off screen. His relationship with Peter is explored and his origin story is told well and most importantly of all his character motivations makes sense. Electro (Jamie Foxx) gives a career changing performance and matches if not exceeding Doc Ock in 2004. He is similar to this character as he is more of a tragic villain, striving to be noticed and changing by a terrible accident into the deformed and terrifying Electro. He changes so drastically throughout the film's runtime it leaves us with a Spidey villain for the ages.Gwen and Peter's relationship is given plenty of depth and is not (thankfully) lost in the plethora of set pieces and action scenes that frequently take place. The struggle of Peter's double life gives us many twists and turns. Andrew Garfield (who is by far the greatest Spidey and Peter Parker) and Emma Stone light up the screen with their meaningful and charismatic chemistry ensuring that sometimes two people talking can be just as exciting as watching the action unfold.The final end scene is heartfelt, surely bringing a tear to even the most cold-hearted of people and will definitely leave viewers overwhelmed by the direction this sequel takes, yet it is never clichéd, boring or predictable.This is a smart film and should be the template for Superhero sequels to follow in many years to come; it is a game changer one that breaks the mould and sets the bar as high as Spidey's web can reach. Webb will need to be on top form to exceed this rare thing; a Superhero Masterpiece.",

In trying to find a cure for his condition, Harry uses all the resources of OSCORP to get something that Spider-man has.

This is not just a story of Spider-man, but the door to an expansion of the universe for this character. Many say that \"Iron Man 2\" was like a trailer for \"The Avengers\", this was (partly) a trailer for the movie of the Sinister Six.The film certainly has a lot more than what is necessary. The opening scene, in which we saw the same opening scene of the previous film but this time from the perspective of the father of Peter, has no impact on history. We have three villains in all, Electro, Green Goblin and Rhino. The first is the main villain of the film. It is one that has a greater presence on the screen and cause more problems to the hero. The Green Goblin, well, not in the movie for only one thing that will not be mentioned. And then we have the Rhino, which has no role in the film is limited to only appear at the beginning and end.The cast returned to do a fantastic job and greater recognition goes to the new faces. Jamie Foxx stands out first by being concise throughout the film. The other new member that deserves to be recognized is Dane DeHaan for his Harry Osborn \/ Green Goblin was at least perfect. The work that the actor did with what he was given, was phenomenal. Forget Willem Dafoe and James Franco, if ever there was a good Green Goblin was the DeHaan despite all the problems that caused the plot in character.The universe of Spider-man is very rich, and often more is worse and this movie was the case. If they had taken things more calmly could have taken the ideas of this film and have done two. What counts is what this is ultimately good save and make us accept his blunders.",

        "body":"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 aimed to expand the universe established in its predecessor but ultimately became entangled in its own web of complexity.The film continued to explore Peter Parker's (Andrew Garfield) personal struggles, delving deeper into his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Their chemistry remained a highlight, and the film's emotional core was undeniably strong.The introduction of multiple villains proved to be a misstep. Electro (Jamie Foxx), while visually striking, lacked depth, and his character arc felt rushed. Harry Osborn's (Dane DeHaan) transformation into the Green Goblin was foreshadowed but executed hastily, depriving the villain of a compelling backstory.The film hinted at a larger Sinister Six plot with the appearance of Rhino and a tease of other villains. However, this setup felt rushed and overshadowed the core narrative.The film's action sequences were visually impressive, and the web-slinging sequences continued to be a standout. However, the pacing was uneven, with some scenes feeling drawn out while others rushed.The tragic climax involving Gwen Stacy was undoubtedly heartbreaking, but it also felt manipulative and predictable. While it served as a significant turning point for Peter Parker, it overshadowed other elements of the film.Despite these flaws, the film showcased impressive action sequences, particularly the electric-charged battles involving Electro. The chemistry between Garfield and Stone remained a highlight, and their performances elevated the film's emotional impact.Ultimately, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was a victim of its own ambition. While it offered some thrilling moments, the overstuffed plot and underdeveloped villains hindered its overall potential. The tragic death of Gwen Stacy, though heartbreaking, felt like a forced climax that overshadowed the rest of the film.",

        "body":"\"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" is the worst movie of this hero, with terrible story and villains and boring romance. Max Dillon, a.k.a. Electro, is a needy moronic lonely engineer that worships the Spider-Man and after an accident, he becomes a powerful stupid enemy that destroys part of New York. Harry Osborn, a.k.a. Green Goblin, is poorly developed; when his father is on the death bed, he learns that he has the same disease that is killing him and becomes CEO of the corporation without any experience. Soon he makes a quick research, has a short dialog with the Spider–Man and becomes his enemy after an announced accident. The romance between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy is boring and repetitive. There is an importance in Peter Parker's parents and Uncle Ben is practically forgotten. There are good action scenes and special effects but that is all. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): \"O Espetacular Homem-Aranha 2: A Ameaça de Electro\" (\"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 – The Threaten of Electro\")",

        "body":"Since this movie was released I've seen it a couple of times. And I always come to the same conclusion, this wasent bad at all.\nGarfield does a solid Spider-Man. It's not the same \"nerdish and a little shy like\" version as Tobey Maguire did, but instead it's a more straight forward Spider-Man\/Peter Parker that feels a bit more modern at times. The old trilogy is classics already by all means, but this one felt more visual pleasing somehow.\nThe chemistry between Garfield and Emma Stone is still there. Sure the story of one of the bad guys played by Jaime Foxx felt a bit too much to maybe make me sympathize with him turning over to the darkside. But then again with great powers comes maybe too much responsibility for some right? Some people just can't handle the power. We can still understand his motives so it doesnt take much away from the action. And this movie felt really great when it comes to visally upgrading the action scenes, making spidey more visually stunning with it's more colorfull visuals then maybe ever before.\nI also think Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborn felt alot better then the original trilogys version that felt flat and childish. This one had depth and his own motives and struggles.\nThe soundtrack is another great one from Hanz Zimmer that adds another level of the emotions felt by the characters and the scenes.\nAll in all i think this one did alot better then people give it credit for. And it feels like a missed oppertunity not making a 3rd one. They had alot of potential moving forward from this one, without going into spoilers. Instead we ended up with a new Spidey that doesn't do it bad either but feels a bit too childish for my taste. This one felt more like a middleground suited for all ages, like it should be.",

        "body":"'The amazing spider man 2' presents itself as a a very entertaining popcorn movie with the likes of Andrew Garfield at the helm of the character Spider-man, in which he is perfectly suited. He delivers again the second time around as a relatable teenager who is just graduating from high school and is having problems with his love interest Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone as he is concerned for her safety. As the film opens we see that he is back to his usual of fighting crime, and the city itself have accepted spider-man as a hero . Peter Parker has a lot on his plate in this one as he discovers the mystery behind his parents abrupt disappearance from his life as a young boy where he delves further into the truth. He is also challenged by the antagonist Electro played by Jamie fox as a man who seeks to be noticed by others. Among the new characters is also Harry Osborne Peter Parkers childhood friend from the past who has come back to New York city where he learns a terrible truth about Oscorp and the Osborne family curse, as he tries to seeks out spider-mans help. As a whole this is a very enjoyable film that has many flaws but are excused by the very well done action scenes that have very impressive CGI, especially the New York central scene with Electro. The relationship between Peter and Gwen is well done as that is director Mark Webbs strongest points to making a movie that involve the relationships between the key characters. The acting is fine by the main actors which also includes the likes of sally field who plays Peters Aunt may and newcomer to the series Jamie Foxx is okay too as Electro.The gripes that I have about the film is that it is all a bit clustered, with too much going on, which brought me back to the terrible spider man 3 but definitely no where near that bad. I think that Harry Osborn could have been fleshed out more as a character and also cast more appropriately. Electro was an exceptional villain from the film as we see the problems he suffers through in life. Overall many fans of the series and genre and genre will enjoy this experience. The film has great acting and the movie is worth it for the entertainment value with awesome CGI, but the movie strives to hard to be bigger than it should be, and expands too much as the film runs overlong by the two hour mark. Mark Webb did an excellent job putting this film together but their is much too that can be improved on for 'The Amazing Spiderman 3' which I'm sure will be very successful as well as this film when it opens world wide.

        "body":"The relationship between Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) has infinitely more chemistry than Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst which is why The Amazing Spiderman series is superior to the previous Sam Raimi helmed version of Spiderman. The supporting cast notably Jamie Foxx as Max\/ Electro, Dane Dehaan as Harry Osborne and also Sally Field and Aunt May are excellent in their respective roles – and also much more fleshed out then usual. Amazing Spiderman 2 manages to slow down the pace and tell a human story while leaving plenty of time for action. While the first Amazing Spiderman was an origin story and more grounded in action scenes Amazing Spiderman 2 pulls out all the stops and looks absolutely fantastic. The strength and chemistry of the lead two characters is the real gem here though striking an emotional chord while the action climaxes in an epic and unforgettable finale. Amazing Spiderman 2 is a rousing success, topping the first in this series and leaving us wanting more. The best rendition of Spiderman yet!",

        "date":"2014-04-18",
        "body":"This Spider-Man is indeed amazing, but the web spun around the film is somewhat clumsy, with too many fuzzy strands to do the wall crawler justice.Okay, now that the obligatory Spidey metaphor is out of the way - Amazing Spider-Man 2 is in my opinion stronger than it's predecessor but falls far short of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 benchmark. Might not be a fair comparison though since I still contend that Raimi's Spider-Man 2 is in my top 5 comic book films of all time. Garfield is cutting the perfect figure as the web slinger and sharing an infectious on screen chemistry with Emma Sone as Gwen Stacey.But my beef with this films lays with two main problems - the writers and the director. Sure, there was some bad acting as well, but I believe that was due to the script the actors were handed.Let me say, I enjoyed this film, in fact I really enjoyed this film but I do have to talk about the parts that I didn't enjoy first so I can get to the good stuff later.Okay so problem number one, the writing in this film is bad, like blatantly bad. I mean, they nailed Spideys comic-book-perfect sarcasm but other than that.. nope not cutting it. I looked the writers up on IMDb to see the rest of credits... mystery solved! It's scripted by the same duo behind the Transformers franchise - suddenly it's shortcomings become more understandable. Kurtzman and Orci are masters of ''whizz-bang'' ''oohs'' and ''aahs'' shoehorned into a mechanical plot provided to advance the story but nothing more. All the baddie origins here make you wistful for the Sandman creation sequence in Spider-Man 3, which isn't something I thought I'd ever say. Electro is lumbered with a shockingly clichéd birth with Foxx struggling (and failing) to make him anything more than the film's time bomb to be diffused. The electric effects are great though if that makes up for anything, and his face-offs with Spidey really do pop.Problem number two is that of director Marc Webb - Webb struggles to maintain a coherent tone, often veering between hyper-real CGI mayhem and soft-focus Twilight-esque teen dreaminess. This is what really threw me off - one second you're watching this great spectacle of an action scene, and then within literally seconds the scene along with the dialogue turns to this really cheesy nonsensical Twilight-esque love scene but with Garfield in tights. I guess the best way to describe it would be like squinting to focus your eyes – all the elements are there but you just can't quite see them all at once. You could tell the film is designed to attract audiences of all demographics, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing - if only it didn't make everything feel shoehorned in. It basically struggles to be it's own thing, even if Raimi's incarnation weren't to your taste, the films did clearly have a defined style that made them distinctive.I feel kind of like saying more would spoil the film and it's still good enough to avoid doing that.Aaand finally we get to the things I liked about the film, credit where credit is due.This Spidey flick does go places that the previous incarnation shied away from and even tweaks the tear ducts ever so slightly at points. Comic-book fans will certainly be pleased to see some elements - Spidey's sarcasm - be more in line with the comic books.The film opens with public support growing in the web heads favor as Parker graduates high school and starts college. However, Spider-Man finds himself up against a new foe - Electro played by Jamie Foxx. Meanwhile the return of his childhood friend Harry Osborn played by Dane DeHaan threatens to throw his life into even further chaos. As to be expected, cue plenty of plot twists that anyone with half a brain could see coming from a mile away and mayhem on a city-wide scale. You certainly can't fault it for its scope.People have been so scared of the amount of villains in the film, pretty much everyone I know was expecting another Spider-Man 3 fiasco – but I have to say, the clutter of villains is actually more about setting up spin-offs and further sequels than overcrowding. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the villains work though – they are hampered by mechanical plotting which of course leads back to the writing that also holds Webb's film back from really hitting the heights it could've. At least Webb and the writers do wrap up and tie a bow on the somewhat irritating parents-as-spy-scientists story thread, thankfully not robbing Peter of his ''ordinary Joe'' back story as the first film threatened to do. With the past dealt with, you realize how much time has been spent on it and with the middle of the film getting dangerously close to being boring. This is especially frustrating when we're rushed into the final reel, ruing the lack of time for stronger character work that could have made the ensuing drama even more impactive.As the credits roll, the exciting action and Spidey's comic-book-perfect sarcasm stay longest in the mind, just winning the day, along with Garfield and Stone's genuinely effective relationship. It's just a shame they're not better served by a film that isn't the sum of its often- inspired parts.But here's the big question - If you find yourself standing at your cinema with a choice between The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Captain America 2, Marvel still triumphs in my opinion. Spidey is always worth watching though and admittedly did leave me with a desire to see more.If you want more reviews please visit www.themoviecorner.net, thanks for reading!",

        "body":"Despite some criticisms, the previous film received several positive reviews, in addition to a good result at the box office worldwide, thus guaranteeing a sequel. Again directed by Marc Webb and scripted by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Jeff Pinkner and James Vanderbilt based on the characters created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, we see the return of Andrew Garfield as our hero, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, as well as Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan, Paul Giamatti in the roles of the main antagonists.In this sequence, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) loves to be Spider-Man, even though being the arachnid hero puts him in very complicated situations, especially with his girlfriend Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and aunt May (Sally Field). Despite this, he balances his various facets as well as he can. At the moment, Peter is more concerned with the ghost of the promise made to Gwen's father, that he would walk away from her to protect her. At the same time he has to deal with the return of an old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), and the emergence of a powerful villain: Electro (Jamie Foxx).\"Spectacular Spider-Man 2\" continues several plots presented in the previous film, showing Peter who remains Spider-Man and helping to save New York City and who also works as a photographer for the Daily Bugle. In love, he continued the relationship with Gwen Stacy, but he lives tormented by the promise made to the father of his love, which ends up wanting to cause a series of conflicts in the relationship and distancing him from Gwen even with the two loving each other. This plot is interesting and makes the relationship evolve, bringing new questions, such as the proposal for Gwen - who continues to work at Oscorp Industries - to study in Oxford, England amid the separation of the couple, which leads them to question whether they should or not to follow different paths in life. Would the couple's love be enough to forget past promises and move on, respecting each other's choice? Once again the chemistry of the couple Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone - who at the time were also a couple in real life - is genuine and engaging. The pair of great actors manage to pass all the complicity and love to overcome the barriers in their relationship. They understand each other in looks, in conversations, in small teasing with each other. By the way, Gwen has a much greater importance than it already had in the previous feature.The character Mary Jane Watson would have a small appearance in this film and would certainly assume the role of Peter's love interest in an eventual conclusion of this second trilogy of the character, especially after the events of the last act of this second part. Mary Jane would be played by Shailene Woodley, who even filmed some scenes like the character in the film, however, months before the premiere, it was announced that Mary Jane was cut from the film. Director Marc Webb later said the cut was \"a creative decision to simplify the story and focus only on Peter and Gwen and their relationship\".\nAnother plot that has new developments is the past of Peter's parents and how he continues to influence the hero in his decisions. The script shows us more of what happened to the parents just before the plane crash that killed them, the connection between Peter's father, Richard Parker, with Norman Osborne and why he had to abandon his son in the care of his uncles Ben and May, as much as they didn't want to. Finally, Peter - and the audience, of course - has many of the answers to the mysteries he has always sought to unravel since he was a child. Her relationship with Aunt May (Sally Field) is also more interesting, with her aunt wanting to protect the boy from the events of the past concerning Peter's parents, whom she believes to be the truth about what had happened. This unbridled desire for Peter to know the truth about his parents' past also causes jealousy in May, who does not want to see his boy suffer.However, the way of approaching the villains was once again the major narrative problem. Even though he has been on the production team since the first trilogy led by Sam Raimi, it seems that Avi Arad and Kevin Feige did not learn much from the initial trilogy. Again, the producers and director Marc Webb try to put several villains and interconnect them in a single story, but just as in \"Spider-Man 3\" - which brought together Areia Sand, the new Green Goblin and Venom - the script does not convince and tries to get just an excuse to join the greatest number of threats possible in a single film, without developing any of the characters.Theoretically being the main villain of the film - which even gives the film its name - Max Dillon (Electro does not pass the image of a great threat until near the end. Played by Oscar winner Jamie Foxx, the character is presented as a brilliant scientist, who developed a plant alone for Oscorp, but who is a rejected person, without friends and who has always been invisible to everyone and who puts on a pedestal anyone who gives him a little more attention or who makes him feel special. Living like that alone made him an extremely unstable person. The point is that Electro's motivations are not credible. The fact that Spider-Man paying attention to him has already made him venerate the hero, even when the Spider doesn't recognize him anymore transformed after the genetic alteration he had suffered after the accident at Oscorp, it is enough for him to become his enemy. Not to mention that he is easily defeated in the fight in the middle of Times S quare and only reappears in the final act when allying with another character.Harry Osborne appears after studying at a boarding school at the age of 11. Rejected by his father and destined to suffer from the same genetic inheritance as his family, the heir of Oscorp Industries returns to see his father Norman (Chris Cooper) practically on his deathbed and starts trying to get the blood of Spider-Man, who could use to search for a cure for your degenerative disease and save your own life. Harry is presented as arrogant, ambitious and doubtful. His father's abandonment and rejection shaped that boy into what he became. Peter's old childhood friend and having helped him when the boy had lost his parents in the past, the two meet again and resume the friendship relationship. The two support each other, as they consider themselves as two rejected, abandoned by their parents. This relationship could have been much better developed, but Harry's vindictive attitudes occur extremely quickly, as well as his transformation into the Green Goblin - with a much better look than that presented in the first trilogy. The villain appears out of nowhere, attacks the hero out of nowhere, loses easily and then disappears, to resurface in the end allied to the mysterious Mr. Fear, in another moment of pure confusion. Despite the good performance of Dane DeHaan, the abrupt form of changes that occurred with the character, are negative points. DeHaan's Green Goblin would deserve an entire film as the main character, so that it could be fully explored.To make matters worse, they still managed to fit in a third villain, Rino (Paul Giamatti), who appears in the first and last scene of the film. The great visual surprise of the film has mere seconds to show its best shape. The character only served to show the audience fans of the comics, what the villain's look would be like in real life. Giamatti, who is an excellent actor, does not have any space to develop the villain.The director Marc Webb bets again on the direction of actors and proved to be competent again both in the action scenes with his camera always very well positioned to bring the best angle to the audience, especially when she passes for the heroes of the arachnid. Despite very well constructed scenes, the feeling we have is that more impactful scenes were lacking. Highlight for the fight sequence between Electro and Spider-Man in Times Square - the electrocuted handrail with the highlight - and the entire final sequence at the Oscorp plant between Spider-Man and the two villains. As in the previous film, the visual effects are incredible. We can also notice a greater number of comedy scenes. In addition to the chemistry with Emma Stone, Garfield is even more comfortable with the character. The Spider looks like he's out of the comics. The attitudes of the Friend of the Neighborhood are perfect. In the fight against villains we have the playful Spider, practically dancing with the enemies.The soundtrack was composed this time by Hans Zimmer, replacing James Horner, the composer of the first film. Marc Webb and Zimmer formed a supergroup with Williams, Johnny Marr, Mike Einziger and Eurythmics, David A. Stewart, to create the music for the sequel. Eventually, Stewart did not participate in the film's music, and the supergroup, credited as The Magnificent Six (in reference to the Sinister Sextet) helped Zimmer in the compositions.However, Spectacular Spider-Man 2 is again a lesser adventure than it could be. It lacked the old lesson of \"less is more\" to guarantee a feature film in its total efficiency and with fewer questions that invalidate its potential. In the face of this gigantism and the poor choice in the subplots to be addressed, The Spectacular Spider-Man 2 is stuck for much of its narrative. The film only thrills once and for all in the beginning and also in the final stretch, when it gains apotheotic airs. It's time for the special effects show, the exciting battles and a good dose of courage, to the delight of those who know the story of the arachnid hero in the comics. Fun, well done and well acted, but with script problems, Spectacular Spider-Man 2 has great chances of repeating the success of the previous film.",

Director Marc Webb's follow-up to the 2012 franchise reboot capably picks up the pieces. Andrew Garfield excels at conveying fragility without losing all of his machismo at once. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is both messy and persistently thrilling. I said this movie it's the franchise's best entry and its least humane, despite struggles to the contrary.The film has a beating heart trapped in the vast machine of the Hollywood entertainment complex. Webb has completed two multimillion dollar superhero movies in the five years since his first feature. Webb continues to show some of the tender sensibilities on display in his debut, 2009's \"(500) Days of Summer\". The movie's smaller moments rank as its strongest, for once turning Spider-Man into the flustered young man. \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" has moments of levity, but no leverage over the boundaries of its formula.

There is of course love interest but this added to the story and I actually bought into it and found myself caring for the characters, no mean feat for a cynic like me. Thankfully it didn't come across all teen\/twilighty which seems to be the norm these days.The villains are very good, Dane DeHaan in particular is exceptional (is it me or does he remind you of a young Leo di Caprio?) and gives a fantastically unnerving performance - big things beckon for him no mistake.If you liked the previous Spiderman movies you'll still love this, If you didn't put any misgivings aside and give it a whirl (as i did). Either way definitely go and see this film, words I never thought I'd utter about a Spiderman movie. You Won't be disappointed.As I said - no plot details and no spoilers, just an honest opinion of my film experience.",

        "body":"In 2012 we got to see a reboot of Spider-Man's story, in my opinion it was better than the original trilogy and I love Andrew Garfield in the role. Now two years later we have a sequel and boy does it get better. First off let's talk cast; Andrew is still fantastic as Peter Parker, he also has great chemistry with Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey. Jamie Fox as Electro was an amazing thing to watch too along with the other great cast members who all do a fantastic job (even Stan Lee with his cameo). The characters in this film were actually really interesting to watch, a lot of the story focuses on Electro and his origin which is fascinating, plausible (sci-fi wise) and downright creepy, I mean creepy; this film goes to places I wasn't expecting; some of the scenes were real freaky to watch, especially Electro and certainly the Green Goblin who was nightmarish to say the least. What added to the creepy and tension had to be the music, the music in this film is phenomenal; there are so many good parts where the music goes perfectly with the beautiful shots that the movie gives you. Talking about the score itself, whenever Electro does his thing and fires electric bolts and everything they go real heavy on the dubstep, a lot, I think that adds to film though in some way, I enjoyed it. The story itself I really liked as well, the ways they went surprised me a few times but were definitely fun to watch, (I didn't see it in 3D but from the scenes I saw at the cinema it would definitely be worth it). The only negative thing I would say about the film is that there are one or unrealistic scenes where I thought \"That wouldn't happen\", It doesn't ruin the movie but does take you out of it for a few seconds. I would say the ending will surprise a lot, and for more than just one reason. In conclusion I want to say The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the best Spider-Man film to date and is absolutely AWESOMENESS.",

        "body":"It was a cold February evening back in 2010. I was walking my dogs in the rangers and it was quite a frosty day FYI so the ground was quite damp and wet. Now as I was walking I slipped and as I did I fell into a pile of dog crap. This wasn't some Poodle's doing were talking about, I'm talking Great Dane business. Maybe it was the frost but it was also quite soggy itself. So not a pleasant experience and I had to walk back home smelling of this dog dung, with my dignity and humility gone. Amazing Spiderman 2 makes that dog crap seem like a Thornton's Chocolate Layer Cake. I mean that with 100% absolute honesty. I just want to say I remember seeing the first Amazing Spiderman thinking this really is as bad as it gets. But boy oh boy did they prove me wrong. You know how you look at things and think how in God's name did you get there. I call this 'the Trump effect'. Amazing Spiderman 2 epitomises this effect - as I was watching the film I was thinking, how did they manage to raise $200 million dollars to finance this film project and that was the result. $200 million! 200 MILLION! Let that sink in for a moment. that's real money right there spent on the film you have watched. (I would hit myself but I'm saving it for something worthwhile later). And like Trump, while I sat and watched this film shocked at its absurdity I had to sit there and think this is so ridiculous its sadly become enjoyable. I mean when you jump of a building onto a bicycle with no seat, you can either a) Experience the pain and agony or b) Think 'you know what this is a pretty funny situation.' Perhaps I should start with the beginning.1)We meet Jamie fox's character. A troubled individual with poor social skills who only wants to be recognised by his Hero Spiderman (I'll give the writers originality points for that). Spiderman saves Jamie and they have a cute bonding session for his birthday. Now we saw the trailer so I know he becomes this 'Electro' character and I was wondering how they were going to pull him off. So I was awe when I realised that the character become Electro by falling into a pool of eels. Now I don't know about you but I know a middle finger when I see one, and Jamie Fox falling into an Eel tank takes the cake. Electro then goes on a mini rampage and Spiderman comes to the rescue but forgets Jamie's character's name. The most obvious human reaction to this event would of course be for Electro to start destroying Time Square with electrical currents and suddenly turning on Spiderman who used to be his long life hero. So lesson number 1, if you ever meet someone emotionally unstable who has accidentally fallen into an eel tank giving the person super human abilities to supply and take in electrical currents. dear god remember their name. 2)Next the side plot Airplane collision scene. The clever writers of this film in their storyboard room decided 'you know what this film needs, a completely unrelated incident were two airplanes are about to collide during Spiderman's big battle with Electro – because you know what we can'. Slaps forehead*. 3)And now Andrew Garfield. Very fitting name for someone who has the acting capability in this film to that of an orange cat. I mean the kid makes me root for the two planes to crash. Also, the actor has as much charisma as a Lidl's Weetabix and the fact he landed this role really sums up the experience. Lesson number 2\/ You apparently don't need to act in an acting role. I could go on ladies and gents but frankly I don't have the time. But in short is the Amazing Spiderman 2 worthwhile? Let me sum that up with a quote from the film.'No'.No one wanted a new Spiderman reboot. We got one. No one wanted a second sequel of that reboot. We got one. At least now we can know that hopefully the producers have learnt their lesson to maybe leave a longer gap between the original films and a new reboot. I mean what are they going to do know? Reboot a Reboot? It makes me chuckle just thinking of the ideaoh wait.",

        "body":"Don't get me wrong, I loved this movie but something was missing to make it the ultimate Spidey movie (and it was definitely not an absence of Sony product placement). First off I would like to congratulate Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield's on-screen chemistry. It was to say the least adorable and true, which is what made this movie a great romance flick rather than an action film that we all paid to see.Garfield's portrayal of the loud mouthed web head we all know and love was a huge step up from the first of the series (which is saying a lot as I'm a sucker for origin stories). The perfect balance of cocky script writing and believable teenage actions made for a great portrayal of Peter Parker and allowed for a fun movie experience. I loved the new suit which paid homage to the old comics which was a nice treat for all you spiderfans out there and ultimately it made the fight scenes seem almost 'too comic' but who's to say that's a bad thing anyway. As for the new 'Baddies', they where good, but not great. I will run through each of them and give my opinions on each;Electro~~ The CGI was fantastic! Despite the original worry that they cast a black actor to play an originally white character Jamie Foxx pulled it and played a very convincing villain. I say villain because his portrayal of the innocent Max Dillon was strange, but kind of good in retrospect.Harry Osborne~~ Although my first impressions of the pictures released where negative, after watching his portrayal of the conflicted and isolated millionaire kid I would say his performance was on par to that of Garfield himself. He made me think, he made me worry and at one point he even made me hate the web-slinger.Rhino~~ For me, Rhino was just there rather than part of the 'enemies unite' team. His character lacked development and in terms of story he just jumped from one to another without really any backingFor a fan of Spider-man in both mediums of comic and cinema this movie was not perfect but it did not disappoint either, it's 100% worth the watch and is the best of the spider-man movies yet. 8.4 stars out of 10",

        "body":"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is more of the same from director Marc Webb. It's a good thing that I didn't pay to see it. Because of the film's marketing campaign and the trailers I was, for some time, looking forward to seeing this sequel. But what I saw was almost as bland and unengaging as The Amazing Spider-Man (2012). As was the case with the first film, the trailers for the sequel made it seem much better than it actually is. It's a cheat in a way. One of the three supervillains in the trailers isn't even an important character in the film. All the action scenes in the film were featured in the trailers. Yes, there's a shortage of action. The actions scenes are few and far between. There's also nothing particularly impressive about them. Director Sam Raimi did the same thing a decade earlier and he did it much better. In addition he made the action scenes lengthy, something that Webb still isn't capable of doing. But Webb's inexperience (or is it a lack of talent?) is evident not only in the action. It's evident in the way he directs actors. We've heard enough about Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone being a couple. But does this make a difference in the film? It makes little difference really. The featured romance is typical for a superhero film. It makes you feel little for the couple, something that becomes much too obvious during an important scene. The screenplay by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Jeff Pinkner doesn't impress. At times it's poorly written. It doesn't help the romance or the proceedings. It doesn't make the characters interesting. It's formulaic. It contains unnecessary parts. These parts are a burden on the film's running time, which is 2 hours and 22 minutes. Yet we still get two underdeveloped and unmemorable supervillains. We get to know their motivations but we don't really get to know anything else about them. This is a fault of the screenplay. Jamie Foxx (Electro) and Dane DeHaan (Green Goblin) don't provide good performances with Webb's direction. In fact, the performances and even the film itself seem cartoonish at times. Also, for a film with such a large budget ($255 million), the CGI looks surprisingly underdeveloped in some scenes. There's just a lack of style in these Spider-Man movies by Marc Webb. If it wasn't for Andrew Garfield playing Peter Parker it would have been a chore to sit through this film. It's not all bad though. Sometimes the actors manage to brighten up a scene. There are some genuinely funny audience-friendly bits. A good electronic score by Hans Zimmer & The Magnificent Six is a bit of an improvement over James Horner's orchestral score for the first film. But at a time when Marvel and Disney are releasing one solid superhero film after another this aimless Spider-Man reboot by Columbia seems primitive. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is only a minor improvement over the first film. Take my advice and don't see it in a movie theater. Don't get duped for a second time.",

The first film came under some criticism especially by lovers of Raimi's trilogy, but I felt it took the necessary steps to redefine the character and it gives the sequel a solid platform to build on.The casting and performances of both Andrew Garfield as Spider-man and Dane Dahaan as Harry Osbourne are particular triumphs of this instalment. I also think Emma Stone does a good job. The Action sequences are exciting and are visually spectacular where they particularly succeed in showcasing Spiderman's powers.I've read some reviews complaining how this film is too much of a romantic flick, but ultimately the relationship between Peter and Gwen is key to the story and adds a much needed dimension to the standard Superhero movie. In fact these interactions between the two characters stand out as some of the best acting performances throughout film.So overall this is a good watch and I'd definitely recommend anyone to go check it out, my only real problem with it was some of the creative choices surrounding Jamie Foxx's character, especially in his characters normal form.But other than that go see it!",

The character's dialogue was pretty good most of the time, witty, sharp - 7 but when it failed it was a 2, and it failed at critical times. The dialogue (and acting) really fell short during the dramatic emotional scenes. A lot of close-ups and teary-eyed emotional scenes that hit the same note and seemed trite. The characters said exactly what they thought, spilling their guts with no subtlety -- dialogue was too head on. The characters ultimately came off as shallow. The story got long and seemed to wander at the end becoming as much about setting up the next movie as satisfying it's potential. More time could have been spent making the characters compelling. It was soap opera acting\/dialogue\/story with top-shelf Hollywood special effects. Not enough for me.",

They show you that; spiderman is a human, he can't save everyone, without making enemies. Everyone was good in this movie, even police officers were good in this movie. I feel that Marc Webb (the director) has learned from his mistakes, no more wannabe spidey, no more trying to funny! And finally, finally, we learn more about his parents. The story is realistic, if you think about it in a superhero movie perspective. They show you the sad part of spiderman's story, they show you the phycology of spidey and almost all the enemies. The vfx are really impressing too, I even think there could might be a Oscar nomination for it.The ending was too fast though, they had the chance to stop it at the right time. But instead they overworked it. There were some parts of the movie, where they tried to be funny, even though it wasn't.... But all and all, the movie was awesome and epic.

My original review below. I watched the movie in 3D on opening night. I was not sure what to expect as some of the critic reviews I had read were not so flattering. However, within the first 10 minutes of the movie I was hooked.Visually, this is the most realistic and fluid Spider-Man film yet. All of the movements and actions are exactly as if you would imagine if you ever read any of the comics or watched the CLASSIC Spider-Man cartoon in the 90's. I was especially glad that the web swinging was realistically designed, as you were shown which buildings the web is sticking to and how it affects Spider-Mans trajectory as he swings through the air.The Acting was top notch. I think Andrew Garfield is the best version of Peter Parker we will ever see. He is a perfect fit for the character and his chemistry with Emma Stone is amazing. The only character that really annoyed me was Norman Osborn. He was, how can I best put it, a Wanksta!The Story was more about Spidey and Gwen Stacy, rather than the villains. I understand that this may have not appealed to some fans. However, this is exactly what Spider-Man is about. Spider-Man is about a regular guy with regular guy problems, which cause him just about as much pain as his work as a superhero. In fact, Spider-Man is more comfortable with fighting super villains on a daily basis than dealing with his past and relationships. Unlike other superheros, what makes Spider-Man so unique is that he is a regular guy who nobody knows about. He ,akes ends meat as a photographer, lives at home with his aunt and has to support her, has a complicated relationship with his friends\/girlfriend and has to juggle all this while fighting crime on a daily basis. Spider-Man provides a unique experience from both the view of a civilian as well as a hero.",

Hollywood can make action masterpieces, but Marvel has greater demand, so that's what we get most of. It's a shame.The stunts and choreography are beyond impressive. Every artist involved does their job to perfection. Donnie Yen's performance is unbelievable. Not only does he fight great, but he also has to move like a blind man. Keanu Reeves is also very impressive. Keanu IS John Wick. Although there are a few scenes where his enemies stand by and wait for their turn to attack, it's easy to overlook because everything else is so great.I can't fathom how anyone could choose to watch Ant-Man over John Wick. It's so fast-paced, and the choreography and stunts are mesmerizing and brutal. When the action breaks out, it's unbelievable. It's hard to explain -- you have to see it!

It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it's become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.One of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry, is the story being written as well as it is. Something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. Not saying the others in the franchise weren't but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as John Wick's true emotions . The rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like Skaarsgard, and even more screen time for supporting greats like Fishburne to compliment the magnificent Reeves. RIP Lance Reddick. It's nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.Speaking of ballistic, this movie goes more all out than any I've seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. Just when you thought you've seen it all, Stahelski\/Reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. These guys were born to make action movies together.The extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. The sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. The sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. It's just an absolute sensory journey that you don't get in too many action films aside from the Wick genre.Overall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we've seen before for the genre or just cinema in general . But also this rich unique story may only build Wick's timeless character for more films in the future which at this momentum will be welcomed.",

There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series.I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.There is every kind of fighting imaginable. So many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (pistol\/sword combo is my fave).The music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action. It is stylistically beautiful.There are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I've never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn't believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip.Donnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph.About an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series, I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome.The subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done, and better, with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. And that's a mild example. Also, it's fairly anticlimactic.Even with those flaws, I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers, biggest screen. TRUST ME.EDIT: I was itching to go again since opening night. I wasn't able to wait more than 5 days. On second viewing, I still felt the same flaws, but I didn't care. The action is incredible. It has at least four* of my all-time favorite action scenes. I want to watch these scenes a hundred times.It's definitely not perfect, but I still consider it an action landmark (last time I said that was Mad Max: Fury Road). Every other action movie should learn from this.

I even enjoyed when they layered in more of this far-fetched stuff with the high-table & continental in 2 & 3. But, we still don't know much about this world, how it was created, or who is in charge. I thought this movie would do more with this secret government for criminals, but instead this movie made those aspects of the story pointless. So many elements from the past movies were just glazed over to essentially give this movie no story. No Elder, No Winston's betrayal, No past characters except Winston & The King, No Dog, No Wife. All of those things amounted to a few 1-liners in this movie. Instead they focused on the worst aspect of 3 and multiplied it with fights that last too long, and people that need to be shot 20 times.

The action is crisp well directed and it is beautifully choreographed. The villains are the best in the franchise Billy Sarsgard and Donnie Yen are amazing. The rest of the cast is awesome as well. The directing, writing , plot ,ending and the begging is perfect. It never feels too long or short , the runtime is well handled. The side characters like Winston,Killa and Charon once again steal the big screen every time they appear in the movie.",

But the action scenes were amazing shooting & fight scenes were taken to another level. Filming one shooting scene from above to see what is going on the other side of the room was awesome and interesting.Hopefully this will be a lesson for the producer, that people want dialogues aswell as action in movies. Not just Keanu saying sorry and you owe me... The dialogues were to few for today's audience to completely enjoy this movie. Story and dialogues are as important as action in a movie.",

        "body":"That lasted 169 minutes? I had no idea. The time just flew right by.Chad Stahelski does not pull any punches (or engage the safety) at any time in this gun-fu epic. Combat scenes are not moments so much as they are entire acts. The amount of stunt choreography that everybody had to synchronize to was rather incredible, and they continue to find more ways to entertain us with kills, kill types, use of weapons, locations, teamwork, etc. I caught myself smiling for minutes on end several times while watching it.Of course though, as I said, they really lean into it. I'm sure this has been true of previous films as well, but it is very apparent that John Wick should virtually die in every scene that he is in. Whether it is how he is attacked or how they fail to attack him at the right times, he goes at every foe like the bear in The Revenant with full adrenaline and no signs of slowing down no matter what he is hit by. And again, I think if you look hard enough you will find enemies who have clear shots and choose not to take them because of plot armor, but you can forgive it enough if you're rewarded with a longer take or overall longer action sequence. What I really loved was how many of these scenes took place at night with dazzlingly lit environments all around, and the music in every scene kicks as much *** as what you see on screen. I had pondered over why John Wick doesn't have a video game yet, but if they ever make one I have decided I'd like one of those top-down shooter games (similar to The Hong Kong Massacre, and if not maybe like the GTA:SA MP rampage style).I acknowledge this franchise for what it is now, but I still pine for some of the missing components that I don't know if it'll ever be able to bring back. After watching John Wick, fun as it was, I found myself interested in seeing a prequel when he was the Baba Yaga in his prime, taking missions rather than being hunted. Even still, at least in that movie he was absolutely feared. In Chapter 2, I still found him heavily respected, but it was in that movie that I realized there would probably be a repetitive formula to the narrative and movie\/action structure (which still has yet to break). In Chapter 3, there only lived assassins and they would go after him without hesitation, which did is not how I felt the world breathed the first time around. They continue down this path in Chapter 4, while opening the universe more to different characters breeding their own kind of loyalty. They are all insanely fun to watch, and you see the cogwheels of the John Wick universe spinning with the future Continental television show and the Ballerina movie spinoff. Where they remain faulty though is even with the existence of civilians during fight scenes, they act as droning NPC's like nothing is happening around them, or they aren't there whatsoever. It is clear that this is not our world that this movie takes place in, but rather a parallel one.I mentioned the introduction of new characters in this world, and you can't not bring up Donnie Yen when talking about them. He steals each and every scene that he is in, and it's crazy because you wonder how a character like his could thrive in such a world but you absolutely believe it when you watch it. I will absolutely take more of him and Rina Sawayama. She isn't featured as much, but she makes use of every second that she is in front of the camera. There are plenty of others (such as the great Hiroyuki Sanada), but the point remains that Wick is relegated to this greater universe with characters who-good, bad, or for themselves-are ones we can actually root for in any fight. Keanu Reeves is understandably less nimble at his age than the others (and it's either bad acting or he really has taken on this John Wick role in his line delivery to hilarious new heights), but he and Stahelski have found a groove that still makes him the most impenetrable force around, to the point that I go back and watch the action scenes in The Matrix Resurrections and wonder what happened there. I didn't love one particular character in their big fighting moment(s), but they go for versatility and I have to give them that much.March has had an incredible run of theatrical films, and John Wick: Chapter 4 is no different. You will lean forward during the action which there is plenty, and if I'm one to go off of you will not feel the runtime. There is an end credits scene as well if you're able to stay for a moment longer. I would love to go back and see this one again.",

In john wick 4, when the action starts in Osaka Japan, it never let's up despite it's almost 3 hour running time. What I really enjoyed the most about JW4 is the cast of characters. Great villains and allies really keep this movie interesting as john trots the globe for 3 hours. The sound engineering, editing, direction, cinematography are excellent as always. The color schemes throughout this franchise (more john wick 2, 3 and especially 4) are such a treat for the eyeballs. Best action franchise EVER.

        "body":"If you enjoy watching other people play video games then you'll definitely enjoy this.There's lots of action, weapons and style - all the things we've come to expect from a John Wick film.Of course it's ridiculous - all of them are. The mere idea that you can deflect bullets with a jacket lapel gives you an indication of how far from reality this film is. Keanu Reeves sustains what would be critical injuries half a dozen times - and shakes it off without any ill effects.With one exception, the amount of damage a character can sustain appears to be directly related to how important they are to the story. Most of the victims in the extensive gun battles (at one point it appears Keanu Reeves is single-handedly depopulating Paris) are gone after a couple of shots. If you have a speaking part then you can take much more damage than any of the extras.The whole idea of the \"secret assassin society\" only works if you don't draw attention to yourself\". So having a full blown Blackwater Contracting reunion at the Arc de Triumph isn't exactly the best way of keeping things on the down low.Throw in a Mr Chow-esque (from the hangover) character and then deciding to make him blind really shows how silly things have got. Last time I checked, gunfighting requires you to be able to at least the person you want to shoot. That said, he is at least still more convincing than Ruby Rose was.The first John Wick film was such a hit because the audience felt a connection with his loss and wanted him to be successful seeking revenge on what were some nasty (if ineffective) bad guys. At this point I'm not really sure what John Wick is supposed to be fighting for. He just lurches from one noir styled location to the next before embarking on an unrestrained killing spree, leaving dozens dead in his wake - you wonder if these people have families.If you liked the second and\/or third film, then you'll like this. It requires little to no thought and the plot is as by the numbers as you'd expect.That said, the action, although resembling a video game, is very well shot, there's lots of cool locations and stylish outfits. Despite the tactical nonsense and the fact that the bad guys wait in line for their turn to attack him, Keanu Reeves has genuine skill in martial arts and pistol shooting.It's as constructive a use of time as playing 3 hours of Call Of Duty in your best suit.",

        "body":"In a world where movie sequels seem to be loathed even before they are released, the 'John Wick' series has remained remarkably consistent and well received. In fact all three of the first films have the same IMDb rating of 7.4\/10 and I noticed recently that I gave them all the same rating of 8\/10. Incredibly, I think 'John Wick: Chapter 4' is the best the series has to offer. This movie was a wild ride.I was a little disappointed when I first saw the runtime for this one was going to be almost 3 hours. I find that is becoming a tough runtime for a lot of films to justify. This film does it with no trouble. The pacing is so incredibly fast that the 3 hours pass by in no time. I remember looking down at my watch early in the film thinking maybe 20-25 minutes had gone by and almost an hour had already passed.A large reason for this is the action sequences. When an action sequence starts in this film buckle in, because it is going to go for nearly 20-30 minutes and be non-stop craziness the for the duration.The action sequences in this film are perfectly shot as they always are in this series. Lovely, wide camera angles so we can see every thing that happens and know that it isn't all being edited to look this way. These people are actually doing these things.As always with these films you need to go in a rather incredible suspension of belief. Wick is nearing super-human level at this point. It doesn't matter how many cars you hit him with or how high the building he falls off is, he'll be back and fighting again 10 seconds later. It's best to switch your brain off at these points I have found.Finally, I loved the main villain in this movie played excellently by Bill Skarsgård. He was everything a villain should be. Calm and seemingly in control, menacing and easy for the audience to hate and root against.This film was a blast from start to finish. 9\/10.",

People want different things out of a movie and John Wick 4 delivers exceptionally well in certain areas while being mediocre in others.A quick summary is I had a fking great time watching it at some points and a little bored during others. The action scenes are fantastic. It's a TON of fun and really cool to watch. A little towards the middle of the film it did feel a bit slow and dragged out. Cutting out 15 mins would be perfect.Held up by good action and decent laughs is the weak story. I absolutely LOVE the idea of the underground black market, the continentals, and the high table. I wish we got to see more of that world. I wanted more backstory, more exposure, more display of how they ran behind the scenes. Hopefully I'll get to see that in the Ballerina and Continental.The other thing I think hindered the movie was that the idea of the high table got watered down. They started off as some serious group that mean business that you don't want to mess with. In John Wick 4 I felt like they were kind of a joke and not really as big as mean as people made them out to be. John Wick was just so broken in the 4th chapter. I know it's the whole appeal of John Wick but it does take away from the story and suspense when, even with suspension of disbelief, is just pure absolute absurdity. But that's also why I love it!I swear John Wick can take more hits than some Avengers. He's like a tank with the body of Wolverine.But regardless of what you're looking for you have to give it to the crew for how much work and dedication they put in to this movie. The quality really shows here. It's just really fun and exciting to watch. I rate it higher than the other John Wick films even though it's not my favorite just because in 9 out of 10 ways it's bigger and better.But I love the other John Wick films because we got more backstory, more Continental, and more focus on story.",

The opponents are set to Easy and you installed a hack to give you invincibility and autoaim.

They use no snipers, no explosives, no traps of any kind. They can't even hit you when they're next to you and wielding a knife.

The style that people have applauded in the first movie has turned into a demented caricature, the fight scenes are ridiculously bad, the actions of the characters make no sense at all, the world described makes no sense.

Director Chad Stahelski has done the unthinkable; he has outdone himself in this fourth entry by taking a two hour and forty-nine-minute runtime (the longest in the series) and making it feel an hour shorter. This is a combat magnum opus, a relentless sensory experience, gorgeously hyperviolent, and easily the best in the series.Baba Yaga is, once again, fighting to defeat the High Table while also facing a devilish and powerful new adversary (a disquieting and deviously memorable performance by Bill Skarsgärd as Marquis) in death-defying, blood-spurting, neon-blasting, stunts-to-spare, well-groomed, high-fashion style. Yes, the plot is rather simple, straightforward, and lacking in in-depth character background, but that hasn't been the strength of any of the Wick films anyway.The masterful elements at play in \"Chapter 4\" begin with its colorful, even extravagant, and likeable supporting characters including Laurence Fishburne as the crafty Bowery, Clancy Brown as the cryptic Harbinger, Donnie Yen - electrifying as the blind, yet intuitive Caine - and most terrifically, Shamier Anderson as Tracker - a shady spy-like character that gives an indelible performance that ranges from brutal toughness to vulnerable subjugation.Add heart-pounding sound effects and a pulsating musical score, striking nighttime, dark and gritty noir-inspired cinematography, and masterful fighting choreography that frames Wick in different cities with sumptuous vistas across the globe (the locales are outstanding from Sacré Coeur, to Arc de Triomphe, to the Louvre, to the Eiffel Tower in France to the opening scene in Aqaba, Jordan plus Berlin and Tokyo) and you end up with what feels like the most edgy, revolutionary, and most James Bond-esque entry yet.The elaborate and visceral set designs are \"Chapter 4's\" crowning achievement; lavish and rich with detail, they put Wick in elegant and high-tech rooms, ornate buildings, rousing nightclubs, and most memorably, a long flight of stairs and heavily trafficked streets where gut-wrenching, head-popping fighting sequences ensue. It's a WICKedly wild ride from beginning to end that left me breathless, gasping, and exclaiming \"wow!\" in wonderment.",

        "body":"I've enjoyed the entire Wick collection but this was my least favorite' The fight scenes were just way too long and usually followed immediately with another way too long fight scene. This movie felt like one long fight scene with a little dialogue mixed in. I could have done with a lot more story dialogue and a lot less fighting. The other movies felt like the fight scenes were part of the story and this one feels like they did fight scenes just to do fight scenes.It's kinda hard to put into words but watch it, and I recommend watching it, and you'll see what I mean. You might like it a lot more than I did.",

It gives a never-ending stream of new structural and actionable aspects that feel natural as it progresses, from the action, to plot points, and personal development. An intertwining of interests rooted in common found circumstances, history, connection, as well as coincidence and luck. As he came back into this life a free man, he wills to fight to leave just as he came no matter the cost. As the nature of it expands with new and unsurprising aspects, this feature more than delivers and entertains.",

Some of the scenes were well choreographed, but by Matrix 3 I was fast forwarding through scenes as it was the same blocking, throwing, shooting of people repeated over and over. It got to the point where it was overkill if you'll pardon the pun.With John Wick 3 I said the same thing. There's one thing being John Rambo, but at least it was believable, at a stretch.Neo and John Wick are both unbelievable and frankly beginning to be boring. They're all just the same.I watched this one as I hoped for something a bit better but all it is is violence, errors, continuity problems and ridiculous scenarios.It's mildly entertaining I think because the acting is mostly OK and production values are high.

And you don't have to be up to speed with the other JW films, necessarily. The 2nd Act is dedicated to JW enthusiasts, but it's not too difficult to follow.There's also an unrecognizable moviestar in hair & makeup (and a fat suit) that I clocked (I won't spoil it--yet). He is hilarious in the role -- very much like Les Grossman (Tom Cruise) in \"Tropic Thunder.\"The 3rd Act of JW4 is worth the price of admission. This is, by far, the best movie of the year (so far) and the last hour is one of the best finales of any action film in recent memory.Shoutout to the production crew. This film doesn't work without the crew. The stunt coordinators, the sound mixers\/designers, safety staff, grips, hair & makeup, choreographers, costumers and the animal trainers. Phenomenal job across the board!!!!!Treat yourself to JW4 this wkd. Stay for the post-credit scene, if you can.RIP Lance Reddick--",

        "body":"Let's be honest if, by now, you choose to see a \"John Wick\" movie then you know what's coming. Several hours of hyperkinetic, over the top violence with a pounding soundtrack and moody lighting. On this front \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" delivers and then some.There isn't a plot that I can recall but once again our favourite assassin is wrestling with the unseen High Table and the price on his head is increasing faster than post-Covid inflation. So every goon in a suit is out to collect and John has to wade through a tsunami of bodies in order to, well, keep killing people.Clearly there's no logic here as John has no identifiable motive anymore or even an end-goal in mind. Instead he's the main character in a video game and you're watching a Twitch stream of someone talented playing all the way through to the final boss.At one point this characteristic is cemented, in spectacular fashion, when the camera shifts to a top-down view and you get to watch John move from room to room in a bloody spree. It's a fantastic sequence, right down to the spray of blood as henchmen #89 gets shot in the head at close range.So is it a great film? Well yes because \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" plays it straight down the line and sticks religiously to its aesthetic. There are no in-jokes here, in fact there are more grunts than dialog, and the film absolutely believes in itself. On that front it's a right belter.",

        "body":"My expectations for John Wick: Chapter 4 was high, these films have become some of my favorite action films of all time, and I can say this without giving it a second thought how it met those expectations. The thugs and easy obstacles are nothing new, except for how they too have ballistic suits like our protagonist. But this Chapter begins with a recovered Baba Yaga who's out for blood. Actors and returning characters along with Keanu Reeves as John Wick is Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King, Ian McShane as Winston Scott, and Lance Reddick (in one of his final roles) as Charon. New roles which I loved was Donnie Yen as Caine: a blind High Table assassin and an old friend of John Wick.Bill Skarsgård as the Marquis Vincent de Gramont: a powerful member of the High Table whose position is challenged by John Wick. Hiroyuki Sanada as Shimazu Koji: the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel and an old friend of John Wick. It also stars Shamier Anderson, Rina Sawayama and Scott Adkins.The premise goes like this: John Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table. But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe and forces that turn old friends into foes.Let's dig deeper into the story and what sequences I liked the most, I have a weak spot for samurai movies and the Osaka Continental offers just that. Brilliant choreography for each character, good guys like bad guys. With Hiroyuki Sanada being as brilliant as ever! Also showing off Donnie Yen's retired blind assassin. It's always nice to see a new Continental and this one sure felt special, you notice what friendship John Wick and Shimazu Koji has. The action sequence was great! But my favorite city and action sequences are found in Paris, it has the biggest importance to the story, it brought so many memorable moments. It shows why Keanu Reeves was and is right to lead this franchise. Paris is also the city where Marquis Vincent de Gramont is located and he becomes the highest-ranking member of The High Table during this film. Bill Skarsgård holds one of the strongest performances in the film as the Marquis. Keanu Reeves holds the best though, maybe not the best dramatic performance but certainly overall performance as he does his own stunts alongside everything else, and the stunts are incredible. Donnie Yen was great and possibly even one of the best things of the movie, both his knowledge in martial arts but also his character which I loved. The performance that surprised me was Shamier Anderson as the mysterious bounty hunter, it's a great character that they could do so much with and I can easily say the same for Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada's characters. One of the final action sequences was all in a one take, except for a quick cut before moving back to the one take. It was shot with a camera above, letting us see everything happening from above and moving with John Wick as he fires inside an abandoned building.Chad Stahelski truly directed an action film that'll be remembered for decades, his direction in both the action and more dramatic scenes are all brilliant. There's so many fight sequences in this film, small like big, all directed and shot brilliantly. The screenplay was done by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch, I don't have any problem with it, it's good and for a Wick film it holds the same quality. The movies aren't about the best writing in Hollywood, it's about what happens on the screen, blood being spilled. Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard returned to compose the score for the film, after doing so for the previous three films. Like Shay Hatten had done too.I have read various of critics and some people complaining about the length, Chapter 4 has a runtime of 169-minutes. Its long, full of beautiful looking shots that does nothing to the story, only to create atmosphere and suspense where it succeeds. There are scenes that you could easily trim, yes, but I still found the length to be perfect. I want to see the 3 hour 49 minute version just because of how great the film was, but the theatrical version is magnificent. Chapter 4 is all about tying up loose ends, to finally find peace and freedom. It's a long road to that point, Chad uses the film's length for just that, to tell a bigger and deeper story than a simple story. More run time also means for more action sequences!This might be the best film of the four, both action and drama, also most beautiful in regards of the camera work and cinematography. Dan Laustsen truly knows his craft, making each scene absolutely mesmerizing to look at! I loved every second of it, when I saw it at the cinema, a woman (a mother) sat beside the person I was there with and said how brutal it was... She was five minutes in and the first action scene had only just started. Jokes aside, John Wick: Chapter 4 has some of the franchise's best action sequences and Keanu Reeves at his best. Like his role in The Matrix, John \"Baba Yaga\" Wick will be another role he'll be remembered for. This was an incredible film, one of the best I've seen in awhile.",

        "body":"As thrilling and relentless as any action movie before it, John Wick: Chapter 4 is an adrenaline injection with Oscar worthy stunt work, assured direction and Keanu Reeves as magnetic as ever. The best Chapter yet...John Wick: Chapter 4 feels like a film where Director Chad Stahelski understood that he finally had the freedom and the budget to do, literally, anything he wanted on the screen-and might never again-so by God, he was going to do it.With characters able to dodge bullets left, right and centre, the film is a homage to the classic martial-arts genre with a sprinkling of old Hollywood Westerns where protagonists never seem to run out of ammunition or ways to stay alive.The movie also deepens its mythology, exploring more aspects of The High Table's history and hierarchy. We learn more about John Wick's past and his connection to other characters in this world. We also meet new faces that add more flavor and diversity to the franchise. Donnie Yen plays Caine, a fellow assassin who shares a bond with John Wick. Bill Skarsgård plays Marquis, a mysterious figure who has ties to The High Table. Hiroyuki Sanada plays Shimazu, a ruthless leader of a Japanese crime syndicate.Donnie Yen brings not only his skills as one of the finest martial arts movie stars in the world, but lends his presence as a charismatic and riveting figure. He plays the role of Caine with complexity and humanity that is a terrific mirror to Reeves' Wick; his friend and adversary by circumstance. This was a fantastic choice to take the Wick series to a new level.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a satisfying conclusion (or is it?) to one of the best action franchises of recent years. It delivers more of what fans love about this series: stunning action sequences, cool visuals, charismatic performances, and intriguing lore. It also leaves room for more potential stories in this universe.",

        "body":"As of now, this is the best movie of 2023; that being said, it still has it's issues. I'll start by saying the action sequences (all 9,000 of them) are breathtakingly choreographed. John Wick's trademarked 'GunFu' is on full display in Chapter 4 (for better or worse). This chapter easily has the highest body count out of the series, but you can't rely on bodies and bullets as your main focal point, especially if it's supposedly the last chapter (I highly doubt it is). Wick is weighed down by plot armor so thick it deflects literally everything, including the viewer's belief that Mr. Wick will ever be in any danger. Hit by 10 cars? Tis but a scratch!My main issue with Chapter 4 is that the plot is very thin and it's stretched out over 3 hours. This chapter is very 'Beginning. Middle. End'. The beginning and end are 5 minutes a piece, while the middle is two and a half hours of John effortlessly walking through goons (which is great, until it's not). I love me some Wick slaughtering goons, but when 95% of the movie is gun fire, you begin to forget what the plot even is, what the movie's even about, which is not good. This movie could've easily been cut down to 2 hours if they edited the fight scenes to a reasonable time, so I hope you don't like plot with your action.Another gripe I had is the fact that John Wick had like maybe 10 lines of dialogue? The guy barely spoke a word throughout the entirety of the movie, and when he did speak, 99% of the time it was him going \"Yeah...\" (which is great, until it's not). Maybe use Keanu\/Wick as a vehicle for the plot instead of having him be a mute protagonist of an FPS video game? He's the title character for God sake! In Chapters 1 and 2, Wick showed a lot of emotion and vulnerability through dialogue and acting (at least more than this chapter) to express himself, but in this he is pretty much the Doomslayer. Also, is it just me or was Keanu's acting extra bad in this one? The line delivery sometimes was just... oof, even for Keanu standards.My favorite part of the movie is a top-down one-take scene near the end where Wick is blasting through goons with incendiary ammo.Overall, the movie is a good time and if you're a Wick fan, then you won't be disappointed. I'd say this is a step up from Chapter 3, but not as good as 1 and 2.7.2\/10.",

Along the way, he faces new enemies and allies, as well as old friends and foes.The movie is a feast for action fans, as it showcases some of the most impressive and inventive fight scenes ever put on screen. From gunfights to knife fights, from car chases to horse chases, from Paris to Tokyo, John Wick: Chapter 4 never lets up on the adrenaline and excitement.

Maybe it's that he just says less. And he knows a little bit (or a lot) more about himself. He knows his strengths and weaknesses. This guy has really earned me as a fan.

There is something entertaining about dumb nonsense sometimes, and the first two of this franchise was decently okay in this regard. The last one and this one however not so much, only dumb.This movie is almost 3 hours long, and oh boy do you feel every minute. Because if you have seen the previous instalments you have seen this one to. This is like a bad video game repeating the same thing, the same course, the same enemies, and for the 4th time. There is also a post credit scene, which is simply dumb, no reason to stil around for it.The acting is also horrid, and if you are going to buy any of this you have to have good acting but no.The only positive I can say about this movie is that it is not as putrified as many other movies lately so for a contemporary action movie this is not as bad as much else.I give this a very, very generous 3\/10. If you want to watch this, don't. Go watch the first one, and maybe the second one instead. Those are also highly stupid, but at least decently entertaining, this is not.",

John wants to clear his name and be done with the table but the route of getting there this time is much harder a task than we have seen before.There are so many highlights of the movie, the action was all superb ! I already after first watch have a favourite which is hard to pick as there are some AMAZING sequences in the movie. I won't say the location because I want to give nothing away but I will say in Paris with a lot of traffic !This movie delves into the characters way more than before, we get really good time with the side characters, usually a movie like this would give them 10-15 minutes screen time and kill them while this isn't the case, in the time sense. We get motive, we get their struggle and really good interactions with John. My favourite side characters were Nobody, Shimazu, and Caine.John takes some hits, serious fall damage but these are the movies not real life hahaha. It's a spectacle on a grand scale.Very small nitpicks, the fights are all superb but I would like some more intimate fights for eg JW1, when they entered his house it felt more threatening, and that's it hahaha it's personal preference as a nitpick which is pretty darn good.JW4 is definitely the best of the sequels and up there with the first in my opinion! 8.5\/10.",

        "body":"John Wick: Chapter 4 is an action masterpiece, an emotionally investing, unashamedly pretentious and extremely satisfying final chapter that continues to celebrate stunt work as the art form it absolutely is and deliver franchise high spectacle that really does put the majority of other action films to shame.Keanu Reeves is even more agile than ever and continues to really impress in the action despite being 4 films in. Once again though, it's not just the action he excels at with the sense of finality this time around adding a sombre and contemplative nature to his performance that is beautiful.The supporting cast is insanely stacked, a definite new record for this franchise. Ian McShane and Lawrence Fishburne play to their familiar strengths and really dial them up. Then there's the newcomers, starting with Shamier Anderson who has a really interesting angle to his character that's a lot of fun.Rina Sawayama makes a terrific screen debut and has great chemistry with Hiroyuki Sanada who can do no wrong and his reunion with Reeves is a joy to see. Bill Skarsgård is another memorable villain for this franchise as a character who dresses like a gentleman but acts like the complete opposite.Scott Adkins plays against type in hilarious fashion and then there's Donnie Yen. Obviously he's perfect in the action scenes and just so cool but on top that he's one of the best characters because his conflict with John isn't as black and white as previous antagonists, making it all the more interesting.Chad Stahelski's direction is phenomenal, the action scenes are still super clean and impeccably choreographed. There's a nightclub scene that actually improves over the original, a fight in oncoming traffic that's jaw droppingly good and a one take that is one of the best of all time.The film also offers an excellent reminder that Stahelski is an amazing visual stylist as well. With Dan Laustsen's cinematography he creates a beautifully film that makes each location visually unique and the lighting in particular is just stunning throughout.The pacing is so good, gaining momentum early on and never letting up. The music by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard is once again incredible, bringing back all the greatest hits without solely relying on them and actually creating the most unique score of the four with plenty of new pieces.",

        "body":"John Wick 4 picks up where the previous film left off, and it does not disappoint. Keanu Reeves returns to the titular character, John Wick, and once again delivers a breathtaking performance that is sure to leave fans in awe. However, this time around, Reeves is not the only one stealing the show. Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsgård, and Lance Reddick join the cast, and their performances are nothing short of outstanding.Yen, a martial arts legend, brings his incredible skills to the movie and delivers some of the most brutal and cool action scenes in the film. Skarsgård plays a new villain who is as menacing as he is unpredictable, and his scenes with Reeves are intense and thrilling. Reddick, who has been a fan favorite since the first movie, continues to shine as the enigmatic hotel manager, and his interactions with John Wick are as entertaining as ever.The movie is directed by Chad Stahelski, who has been with the franchise since its inception, and he continues to showcase his expertise in creating thrilling and visually stunning action sequences.But it's not just the acting that makes John Wick 4 a standout action movie. The work of the stuntmen is absolutely incredible. The fight scenes are brutal and fast-paced, and the choreography is flawless. Every punch, kick, and gunshot feels real and impactful, and it's clear that a lot of time and effort went into perfecting each moment. The use of practical effects and minimal CGI is also noteworthy, as it makes the action feel more grounded and visceral.The supporting cast in John Wick 4 also deserves recognition for their performances. Halle Berry is a standout, and her character's relationship with John Wick adds an emotional layer to the movie. Laurence Fishburne and Ian McShane, who both appeared in previous films, continue to deliver excellent performances, and their characters' interactions with John Wick are always a joy to watch.The music in John Wick 4 is yet another aspect that deserves praise. Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard once again provide a score that perfectly complements the action on screen. The music builds tension and excitement, and it enhances the overall experience of watching the movie.Of course, as with any action movie, there are some flaws. The plot can be convoluted at times, and some of the characters' motivations may not be entirely clear. However, these issues are easily forgiven in light of the incredible action and performances.In conclusion, John Wick 4 is the ultimate action sequel. Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsgård, and Lance Reddick all deliver outstanding performances, and the stunts, direction, and music all contribute to making this movie a must-see for action fans. The franchise continues to raise the bar for what an action movie can be, and John Wick 4 is no exception. If you're looking for a thrilling and entertaining ride, then don't miss this movie.",

The first one made sense, the second one I understood and the third one provided a nice opportunity to wrap the STORY but they didn't, instead it was more just a non stop choreography dance. The scene that really made start zoning out was when he's in a shootout with about 100 men in a club while people continue dancing around them completely unaffected by what's happening. Multiple times you can see a bad guy wait for John Wick to look at him before attacking, it's just getting old.",

        "body":"Far better than I was expecting. Not that I thought it was going to be a bad movie in the slightest, but I was not expecting to be so bedazzled by it. John Wick has stepped up to the plate and hit that man meal out of the park every single time. Keanu Reeves and filmmaker Chad Stahelski have done everything in their power to keep the action constant.The odd part about that is that this movie did not have the best action sequences out of all the movies, but it did have the most in depth story. That itself is odd considering that John Wick movies are not about story. That is why this whole thing started over the fact that the son of some crime boss killed the dog his late wife gave him. It's a humorous plot that commits to the Franchise's statie of action film plots, but this movie decides to take itself a little more serious than all the others, really focusing on how far Wick has gone down the rabbit hole snice the first film. Surprising but not bad.Then you have the action, done by some of the best in the world. John Wick 4 feels like one of those episodes of the Mandalorian that's not about the Mandalorian at all. Afterall when you have Donnie Yen in the movie you want to make sure he's doing as many cool action sequences as possible, which means that there were a few times in this movie in which John disappears to allow others to shine. Great as far as the action.Also great, Scott Adkins in a fat suit. Now I want them to do a spin off movie with Scott Adkins in that fat suit.I would keep going but I do not want to be as long as the movie was. Do not worry you don't even notice. The film is too hard hitting for that.",

        "body":"John Wick: Chapter 4 joins Mad Max: Fury Road in being the fourth film in an action franchise that is also hands-down the best film in its franchise.The pacing issues present in the last two movies are nowhere to be seen here; remarkable, given the behemoth 169-minute runtime. It absolutely earns that runtime with action sequences that never once feel repetitive and a plot that is always moving.Every single gloriously carnage-filled set piece introduces unique geography, weaponry, and style to the mix so that every scene is more shocking and thrilling than the last. I can't remember the last time I was so consistently entertained for nearly three straight hours.This time around there are also several new characters introduced, and they're all given much more personality and narrative purpose than anything we've seen before in these films. For the first time in four movies, I actually got invested in the story on multiple levels rather than just being thoroughly entertained by the action.But it must also be acknowledged that this movie is absolutely insane, and is not meant to be taken seriously. John Wick is an invincible man, frequently surviving things no man can possibly survive. If implausibility bothers you, this will be your nightmare.The story does try to dive deeper into the theme of \"actions have consequences, and nobody is immune to consequences\" that was touched upon in the previous movies. I commend them for trying, but it's still done in a far too surface-level way to be impactful. The writers really glossed over some pretty heavy plot points whose consequences should have been explored in greater detail, and because of this, I didn't feel anything I think they wanted me to feel when the film ended.But this is a minor complaint for a movie like this. Chapter 4 is the display of a master action filmmaker who continues to dare to go bigger and bolder, and I can't wait to see what kind of spectacle he presents us with next.",

However I feel that the true identity of this franchise was completely lost with this fourth chapter. The first two movies for me are the best because the stunts look more credible. \"Parabellum\" started to drop in quality, but it was still a solid flick. Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless.",

        "body":"Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.\nOverall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned.",

        "body":"I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations. I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas. I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony. I give this movie my highest recommendations. It's a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.",

He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...).

        "body":"AVENGERS:INFINITY WAR,to say in one line,is perfectly balanced as all things should be. It was the most anticipated movie of the decade,and it had to deliver what seemed impossible-bringing together two dozen superheroes,combining plot threads from the previous 18 films,introducing the biggest villain onscreen and perfectly balancing humor with emotions and action with drama-all in a single film-and the russos nailed it.... Mild Spoilers follows... The main attraction of the film ,is no doubt the Mad Titan. Thanos is not your usual villain. He is complex and multi-dimensional. He is cruel,ruthless,kills but at the same time, he mourns,shows compassion,and above all-he has a reason for his actions-and that's what makes him the most interesting and dangerous villain. He gets the most screen time than any other hero...It is as if he is the central character. Its as if we are following his journey of collecting the six infinity stones so that he can destroy half the universe. He wants to wipe out half of the universe,not because he sees fun in it nor he wants to rule. All he wants is to achieve balance in the universe. According to him if the universe is left unchecked,then the universe might destroy itself due to overpopulation. He wants to do this action so that the other half and the future generations can thrive....he describes it as mercy. Along with him ,the film also gave us sidekick antagonists in the form of black order. Among them,Ebony maw was cool to watch. The actions and choreography were amazing. If you thought the actions in the trailers were awesome,o boy...u aint seen nothing. The people behind the camera ..they did a fantastic job. The art work was good ...and the cgi and vfx looked realistic. They did a remarkable job in capturing all the facial expressions in josh brolins face. Nothing to say about screenplay...its just ....I cant imagine how they delivered it ..and like a star wars movie we got to see different parts of the galaxy-From the sanctum sanctorum to New avengers facility. From wakanda to New york. From Nevidilir to knowhere and from vormir to titan and finally to wakanda...The shifting of story from one scene to another scene and location without confusing the plot was executed perfectly. The dialogues were sensible..and the film is filled with lots of pretty and punchy one liners that will fill you with laughter,and some that will make you emotional. The character interactions...well this was what we wanted to see more than anything...and trust me ,the russo brothers delivered more than what we expected. Not only that, the film gives adequate time for characters to grow and develop in such a short time frame that you feel for each and every character ...its a treat for those who have followed all mcu films and had made the characters part of their life.....the interaction between these different characters is what makes this film unique.....there are reunions...there are first meetings..the plot is written as such that each and every character is vital to the story... The guardians get a lot of screen time...and Thor-guardians interactions are one of the best and most entertaining moments in the film .The trio formed by dr strange,peter parker and tony stark was also very amazing..The first meeting between earths mightiest heroes and the guardians of the galaxy is very funny ...The thanos-gamora relationship is very well explored ..the film also gives ample time to vision-scarlett witch romance that was teased in the trailers... captain america has a grand entry ..we get to see black panther...bruce banner ..o well he has his own arc in the film and is funny.. and so on...\nIts the darkest and most emotional movie in the franchise..as the first scene itself sets the tone for the entire film. The stakes are higher than ever and the ENDING will just make you numb .....,\nIts not just a superhero movie..Its a movie about love,relationship,sacrifice and above all asks a moral question- \"under what condition is it just to trade one innocent life to save others\".",

        "body":"Let me be clear Infinity War is not flawless, it has its faults but thankfully they are overshadowed by two hours of awesomeness.Every movie in the Marvel universe for the last decade has ultimately been building up to this therefore expectations were through the roof and for the most part it delivers.Almost every character from the MCU teams up to face its most dangerous foe yet, the mad titan himself Thanos and if you know anything about the comics then going in you'd know to brace yourself for heartache.With all the hype as to who wouldn't survive the film I'm left wondering just how many deaths are permanent, this is a superhero universe after all so never say never.Though the story and Thanos's motivations differ from the comic this can be forgiven as the new story is wafer thin but competent.As you can imagine one of the most exciting things about Infinity War was uniting heroes we've never seen side by side and that certainly delivers on all fronts. The action is thick and fast, despite the dark overtone we have plenty of comedy and teenage Groot didn't ruin the film like I feared he would.Obviously this is not a big finale and merely a high profile chapter in a much larger story but the movie is highly climatic regardless.I am saddened that this wasn't a two parter, alike Civil War (2016) this was a huge story and perhaps should have been broken up across movies.Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film.Excellent stuff, though where in the blue hell was Ant Man?The Good:Children of ThanosThanosAll out action as expectedTies everything together nicelyThe Bad:Peter Dinklage (Never thought I'd say that)So many characters were spread too thinThings I Learnt From This Movie:If Thanos and Cable ever meet its going to be super weirdDishonest footage\/photos are commonplace now (Look up the footage of Hulk in Wakanda running with the rest of the team) Seriously, never happened.Somewhere out there right now are DC fans claiming this is a bad film",

        "body":"Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk\/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It's a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields. Thanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet 'Titan' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations.Even though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it's unpredictable. It's full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That's not to say they don't get anything to do because they do, it's just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it's a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon's need for artificial limbs, Thor's new haircut and Drax's constant quips. There are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don't look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it's a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that's just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its \"baggy\" or \"overlong\" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified.",

        "body":"Have found myself liking or loving a lot of Marvel's previous work, while finding a few faults with most. It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me. Loved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever. More could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen.Scarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it.However, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view.Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character. Likewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion. 'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart. Marvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored. Overall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9\/10 Bethany Cox",

In other superhero movies i usually get these moments of \"wait, where are we?\" or \"wait, why are they fighting again?\". This one felt more compact to me. GOOD JOB!That said i still don't care about anything that happened or will happen in these superhero movies. I did pay for a ticket and therefore contributed to the financing of future films though, so you're welcome.",

I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in \"Endgame\" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly \"Infinity War\" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10\/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.",

        "body":"\"Avengers: Infinity War\" may well have hit the consumer sweet spot formula: the all-important kiss to boost the box office, heavy emphasis on comedy, loads of explosions, and a story that enthralls above all else. \nThat being said, this latest installment plays it safe and rode on a long hype train spanning back over a year - Infinity War opts for the tried and true with the odd tweak thrown in, it's ambition is to be an amusing superhero popcorn flick, nothing more, nothing less; and on that count - it perhaps succeeds.Not really accessible to new viewers of the franchise.Infinity War is not for the entry-level viewer (if you want to fully understand it, at least) - lacking accessibility, it offers little explanation of the prior plot to the newly introduced - 31 movies have led up to this in one way or another: to an all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. \nInfinity War assumes you haven't been living under a rock and have seen (at least some of) the previous movies, to some viewers this will be a deal-breaker.\n \nSo, for those reading who have no prior investment in the universe and its characters - this may be a disappointing watch. To those who have seen previous films, it still may be disappointing - the story is nothing to shout about.Great CGI.No, really, I will praise the special effects. Staggering stuff, and no doubt what helped make it one of the most expensive films of all time to produce.Too many characters.The Russo brothers were tasked the impossible job of covering a very broad cast of some 35 characters to the best of their ability within the 2 hours and 40 minutes run time, and to say the least, they were stretched thin. \nFor the average fans, more characters is a major selling point - to those more concerned with the fluidity of the film-making and storytelling, it didn't work. The story felt somewhat fragmented as the plot's focal point kept shifting to accommodate the sheer number of characters.It bordered on a comedy.For some that's okay, in a film that is meant to be a culmination, the big showdown of epic proportions - I was surprised how dependent on comedy it was. I would have liked more story-building dialogue and character development instead. It didn't match the vibe of stopping a dude (Thanos) that could potentially kill trillions of people. \nWhile some of the slapstick humor was welcome, at times it went too far, it felt as if it didn't work alongside the serious scenes and situations that it often tried to segue into seamlessly - to no avail.Geared towards a younger audience. As a heads up, this movie without a doubt is meant to appeal towards Marvel's biggest target market - kids and early adolescents. It makes little to no provision for those into well-written, sophisticated plotlines that transcend shooty guns and big explosions. \nMost of us have outgrown the cliches. Poor ending.Most of the audience remained seated in the cinema expecting some closure, but the credits just kept rolling. A poor cliffhanger ending that just tries to sell the next film.Overall 6.4\/10",

The stakes are sky-high, with the formidable Thanos looming as a threat of cosmic proportions. The Russo brothers showcase their directorial prowess, skillfully managing the massive ensemble cast and multiple storylines to create a cohesive and engaging narrative.What sets \"Infinity War\" apart is its audacious decision to give equal weight to its villain, Thanos. Josh Brolin's nuanced performance injects the Mad Titan with a formidable presence, and the exploration of his motivations adds layers to the character beyond the typical antagonist tropes. This bold approach elevates the film, creating a genuine emotional investment in the fate of the universe.The movie's big spectacle moments are nothing short of awe-inspiring. The visual effects are a testament to the technological prowess of the MCU, delivering jaw-dropping sequences that make full use of the cinematic canvas. The action is relentless, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats as heroes from across the galaxy unite in a battle of cosmic proportions.Marvel Studios strikes a perfect balance between gravitas and hilarity, infusing the film with the trademark humor that has become a hallmark of the MCU. The banter between characters adds a welcome levity to the intense situations, showcasing the camaraderie and chemistry built over years of interconnected storytelling.The plot's boldness is evident in its willingness to subvert expectations and take risks. The film doesn't shy away from exploring darker themes, resulting in emotionally charged moments that resonate long after the credits roll. The conclusion is both shocking and satisfying, leaving audiences eagerly anticipating the next chapter.In summary, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" stands tall as a testament to the MCU's ability to deliver a cinematic event of unparalleled magnitude. This epic superhero ensemble is a must-watch for fans and newcomers alike, showcasing the unparalleled storytelling and blockbuster entertainment that has become synonymous with the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",

It tells the story of how the Avengers, Earth's mightiest heroes, confront Thanos, an Eternal, who is determined to gather all six infinity stones and wipe out half of the universe's population. The fate of the universe rests on their shoulders.It begins with a high stakes opening sequence on a ship, where Thanos and his children are introduced with well-written dialogue and a powerful score by Alan Silvestri. The Hulk's confrontation with Thanos showcases the sheer might of the Eternal, establishing him as a formidable adversary for the Avengers.Despite a large cast of characters, it balances them well without feeling overstuffed. It tells a compelling story in two and a half hours, maintaining consistently fast pacing. It features notable performances from actors like Josh Brolin, who plays Thanos with great intensity and Robert Downey Jr., who delivers some of the best-acted emotion in the entire MCU, adding depth to his character.However, some parts of the movie are criticized for feeling contrived or lacking in visual appeal. For example, the moment when Starlord punches Thanos feels forced, and the CGI and aging effects on certain suits are questionable.Despite these flaws, Infinity War is a monumental achievement in the MCU's early phases and stands as a convincing assertion that these films are indeed a form of cinema.",

It also ties in with other events, such as New York.The movie is structured perfectly, from Thanos' perspective, putting him on a hero's journey. He travels to different locations to collect stones from heroes we know and love. We also get to see heroes that don't usually interact, and the movie is filled with iconic moments because of this.This film is unlike anything I've seen in the MCU, and while I love Endgame, I find myself more of an Infinity War type of person. The ending is absolutely insane-a bold and creative choice, which I think is something everyone loves about this film.

And while the last two Captain America films have escaped popcorn and can be seen as real achievements, the Avengers have kept to a more Disney comfortable spectacle.We ride from fight to fight, changing scenes but staying firmly locked into a fantasy present with no solid meaning, much better explored in comics. But even this limited form is broken here - with the idea of a villain who is neither camp nor fickle. By developing Thanos the film actually makes it's normal limitations feel worse. There is an empty parade that is supposed to support the narrative but can only manage sputtering buddy humour and colourful mayhem. From this thin gruel we are expected to construct a framework in our minds to justify the story. While enjoying the expensive antics, the attention wanders through the inevitable plot holes, pointless scenes and rolodex of similar heroes.Better to keep to the single dimensional tunnel of the continuous spectacle, or dare to write a proper film.

The film masterfully weaves together a multitude of storylines, bringing together an ensemble of beloved Marvel heroes to confront their most formidable foe yet: Thanos, the ruthless cosmic warlord seeking to restore balance to the universe by wiping out half of all living beings.At the heart of Avengers: Infinity War lies a complex and compelling narrative that explores themes of power, sacrifice, and the delicate balance of fate. The film challenges conventional superhero tropes, questioning the very nature of heroism and the cost of saving the world. Thanos, portrayed with chilling intensity by Josh Brolin, emerges as a formidable villain driven by a twisted sense of righteousness, adding a layer of moral ambiguity to the story.The film's action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking, showcasing the impressive power and skill of each Avenger. From the intense clash between the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thanos's Black Order on the planet Titan to the epic showdown in Wakanda, the film delivers a visually stunning and visceral spectacle that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats.Moreover, Avengers: Infinity War excels in its character development, giving each Avenger ample screen time to shine. We witness the growth and evolution of beloved characters like Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America, while also introducing new heroes who make their mark, including the brilliant Doctor Strange and the enigmatic Scarlet Witch.The film's emotional impact is profound, as we witness the bonds of friendship and camaraderie forged among the Avengers tested to their limits. The loss of beloved characters is handled with sensitivity and depth, adding a layer of tragedy and realism that makes the stakes feel incredibly high.Avengers: Infinity War's most defining moment, the one that will forever be etched in the minds of MCU fans, is the ending that leaves half of all life in the universe decimated. This shocking and heartbreaking twist serves as a devastating conclusion to the film, leaving the audience reeling with questions and anticipation for the future of the MCU.",

The Walled City of Kowloon was a real place, running with little government intervention, which adds an aura of mystique and allows for creative liberties.Stuck in development hell since the 2000s, the studios saw huge potential in this film and bet big on it. They assembled some of Hong Kong's finest crew and production team, even creating a replica of the Walled City for shooting.The action sequences are fine but not groundbreaking. There are too many quick cuts intended to show the hectic and intense nature of the fights, but this detracts from clarity, unlike the more appreciable choreography seen in \"Ip Man.\"Louis Koo and Raymond Lam, both veterans of the trade, successfully helm the film. Koo brings an enigmatic and benevolent image, while Lam offers an effortless everyman appeal. The supporting cast does their part well, with Philip Ng being particularly lauded for his rare villainous turn as the nearly unbeatable big bad.The film seems to suffer from catering to too many characters and their different motivations, resulting in a predictable storyline. However, for kung fu fanatics like myself who enjoy the action as much as the Hong Kong brand of drama that comes with it, this is a long overdue and very welcome dose of ass-kicking goodness. Hopefully, it starts a new wave in the years to come.",

Next to that the more interesting stories were happening around the main story, with people working in the walled city and especially the little girl doing all kinds of odd jobs was more interesting then the all the main character combined and also the only character you really feel most for. But also it feels like we are missing a whole prequel movie that was shown in the flashbacks moments, to understand the main story a lot better.The movie has a lot of over the top action, but also comic characters who are over the top with special moves. But for me the final fight felt it dragged on for too long.For me for I wished they made another movie with these set pieces, but too bad all of it is long gone as they were filmed several years ago.

It was the equivalent of a large block of properties, within properties - a mass of alleys, corridors and tunnels in which the law was enforced in a very different way from the outside. This story starts with a battle that sees control pass from \"Jim\" to \"Cyclone\" (Louis Koo). There's now a truce of sorts that exists between the bosses and the outside world, but that's about to be thrown into turmoil by the arrival of \"Lok\" (Raymond Lam). He works hard to get an official ID card but is fleeced by \"Mr. Big\" (Sammo Hung) and escapes with a bag of his cocaine into the walled city. That's where he encounters it's ruler and his sidekick \"Shin\" (Terrence Lau) and where his willingness to work and his fortitude ingratiates him with the boss. On the outside, \"Cyclone\" has a business relationship with \"Chau\" (Richie Jen) who has really only one purpose left in life. That's to avenge the murder of his family by the now dead \"Jim\". The focus of his revenge is that man's own son - but nobody nows what happened to him. Well, swiftly you can add two and two and get \"Lok\". Loyalties are now tested, friendships challenged and forged whilst the fragile peace is soon in tatters. With battle lines drawn and ambitions clear, it's all out war and the action mounts up. This is a sold end-to-end martial arts film with plenty of nimble and lithe combat; acrobatics and bodies that must be made of skin-clad tungsten steel. It's got a little bit of mysticism and embodies human nature, whether benign or not, quite entertainingly and by not just throwing itself about, but by at least trying to create and develop the characters. The denouement takes it's time and does become a bit repetitive, but as a quickly paced drama it really does fly by for two hours.

But I wonder, wouldn't it be better for the overall movie if they just made the entire show more realistic by omitting those fanciful effects?Main strengths of the movie:1) The main setting of the movie featured the Kowloon \"walled city\"\/slums which was depicted in a realistic manner, and camera angles were panned well. This area has historical significance in Hong Kong. I thought it was a unique idea to bring these to the big screen.2) The beginning part of the movie was done well too, with the main characters in the \"walled city\" being quickly introduced and building up the suspense between the various factions of power.3) The main theme of loyalty and brotherhood was consistently emphasised and showcased. The movie direction was clear.Flaws of the movie:\nThe lack of a solid ending was the Achilles' heel. It was just too convenient to resort to the conventional style of good vs evil. Too many fighting scenes led to deprivation of screentime for character development, especially the villain played by Philip Ng, who could had offered more.Conclusion:\nIt is an interesting film if you're longing for some Hong Kong martial arts movie. But this isn't near Hong Kong's best.",

Too many fight scenes but unfortunately no memorable ones. There should be some tense buildup prior to a fight scene think of SPL Donnie vs Wu Jing at the rooftop or Winter soldier elevator fight.Cinematography and colorful character is wonderfully done. Raymond Lam is convincing as the hero and much better than his role in New Kungfu Cult Master.The movie need a prequel to explain on the flashback in depth.",

Some of the action sequences were brutal, especially since they were set in the Kowloon Walled City. The film isn't just mindless action but it takes its own sweet time following the characters and making you care enough for them (which is rare in mindless action films) but that ends up being the plus\/minus for the film.There was less action that I expected and a lot more character building, but whatever action was in it was enjoyable, minus the climax fight which...made it seem like it was out of a superhero movie, which this wasn't. That said, following the characters was enough to give the climax a pass. With a better final fight, I think the film would have been a GOOD action-drama, but in certain ways it still ends up being that.Would recommend for a one time watch, especially if you're an action lover.",

It all just falls apart from there.The Kowloon walled city set is amazing, yet overly bright and well lit for a place renowned for its darkness.The fight scenes are well executed but poorly shot where you can rarely see moves clearly.And, after this - it just gets absurd.There are characters upon characters introduced, storyline after storyline, and every time I thought it was approaching a final fight, the film would introduce ANOTHER way to extend the story and ANOTHER reason there needed to be another fight.But that's not the worst part, because only 30mins into the film it just starts to become absurd!What could have been a straight-forward, no-holes barred, fast paced fight film with a simple story and an epic location, ends up being a long, overly complicated, fanciful, bore that has ridiculous moments and bizarre storyline additions that made me regret spending money to see it in the cinema.This could have been an absolute classic had it been dark and simple, yet will quickly be forgotten as it's just not good, and utterly disappointing.",

        "body":"Soi Cheang's Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In throws us into the heart of the Kowloon Walled City, a labyrinthine sprawl of crime and community in pre-handover Hong Kong. Lost and adrift, Chan Lok-kwun (played by a capable newcomer) stumbles into this hidden world, forced to navigate its treacherous alleys and forge unlikely bonds with its denizens. While the fight choreography is undeniably impressive-think balletic brawls with a dash of Jackie Chan-esque acrobatics-the narrative itself struggles to find its footing.The film's greatest strength lies in its historical context. Cheang masterfully recreates the claustrophobic chaos of the Walled City, a place where desperation and resilience go hand-in-hand. The production design is phenomenal, capturing the grimy underbelly of the city in meticulous detail. We see makeshift markets, overflowing with life, nestled beneath the looming concrete jungle. This immersive world-building is further enhanced by the film's colour palette. The muted greens and browns that predominate, punctuated by bursts of neon signage, perfectly reflect the harsh realities of life inside the walls.However, the plot itself feels a tad derivative. The wide-eyed outsider finding redemption within a community on the fringes is a well-trodden path, and Twilight doesn't offer much that's fresh. Philip Ng's portrayal of the main antagonist, who consumes scenery with gusto, comes off more like a caricature than a fully developed foe. The film also suffers from some pacing issues, particularly in the second half. The frenetic energy that propels the first act gives way to a drawn-out final showdown, complete with an overuse of CGI that detracts from the otherwise impressive fight choreography.That being said, the performances elevate the material somewhat. Louis Koo exudes quiet charisma as a wise mentor figure, and Raymond Lam brings a relatable vulnerability to his role. The camaraderie between the young leads is believable, even if their characters lack depth. The editing, while occasionally frenetic, keeps the action sequences engaging, even if it sacrifices some clarity in the fight choreography.Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In is a visually stunning and well-acted homage to a bygone era. It falters with a predictable narrative and some reliance on special effects, but the film's heart lies in its exploration of a unique historical setting. Fans of Hong Kong action cinema and anyone interested in the Kowloon Walled City's legacy will find much to appreciate here. However, those seeking a groundbreaking story or innovative action sequences might leave feeling a little shortchanged. Overall, Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In is a fun, albeit familiar, ride through a fascinating world, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of the genre's best.",

        "body":"Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In (2024), is the latest theatrical release from Well Go USA Entertainment, hitting US markets last week.The story takes place against the backdrop of actual historical events in the late 1980's as The Triads controlled the Kowloon Walled In City within Hong Kong, until the agreement between Hong Kong and Britain led to its demolition. This densely populated, and, largely, lawless territory was run by Organized Crime families.The film vividly paints the picture of what the living conditions and social mores of living and surviving in this environment were like. If this was the only basis of the film it would still have been pretty interesting; however, this film is much more than that. The movie is an action packed, martial arts dram and action film starring some of the most legendary and exciting Hong King Action stars to ever appear in film.The foundation of the plot involves the fracturing of the relationship between the crime families as the result of the re-emergence of a decades old incident that flares upon due to the presence of a stranger with a significant past.Louis Koo and Sammo Hung provide familiarity, credibility, and excitement to this film. Their fight scene is one of its highlights. I really enjoyed watching these two legendary action stars scrap.The script, acting by a large and diverse cast, and Direction are extremely high level and laudable. They exceed the genre and Pareto be commended. This is good filmmaking. The story is engaging and the cinematography captivating. Sir Cheang's Direction helps enhance the Walled City as a character.The fight Choreography is terrific. To be clear, it is Hong Kong Style; meaning much of it is \"over-the-top\" and, somewhat, supernatural. That is ok. The audience is in on it, and it is so well done that we can not help but enjoy it.Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In (2024), will keep the average martial arts movie man engaged throughout, but it will more than thrill the lover of the heyday of 20th Century Martial arts action filmmaking.I recommend it. See this in theaters, but see it again when it gets released on demand and digitally.",

The story is rich with the human values of loyalty, community, belonging, what it means to be a leader in the context of an over populated walled up city.

Only a Hongkonger would get that! And only HongKongers who grew up in that generation can reproduce the Wall city with such authenticity physically, culturally and spiritually.The martial arts aspects are of course dramatised for entertainment value, and pleasingly, martial art aficionados will still be able to identify the genuine characteristics of different styles of martial arts used in the movie.The story itself has enough depth and interest to hold most audiences, without being overly complicated. There are moments of good humour that reinforce the characters human side.A thoroughly and surprisingly well made and entertaining movie.

Here, while there are some great action moments and some really well-done fights, it's themes and character arches have been over-done in the past which causes the movie to feel aimless and disconnected with itself.Relying way too much on the action and causes some of the good character moments and themes to feel slow and boredom.

        "body":"Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In is a colorful blazing fury of fisticuffs that spins the infamous Hong Kong landmark into an entertaining pop art mythology.Director Soi Cheang, cinematographer Cheng Siu Keung, and production designer Kenneth Mak strike the perfect tone, crossing Hong Kong nostalgia with a wuxia comic book aesthetic.The story chronicles the rise of Chan Lok-Kwan, an illegal immigrant and bare-knuckle boxer surviving on the streets of 1980's Hong Kong. Getting in trouble with local gangster Mr. Big, Chan finds refuge in the Kowloon Walled City, a lawless territory outside of British Hong Kong, and is taken in by gang boss Tornado and his underlings.The British Government announcing the demolishing of the Walled City ignites a gangland war, settling personal vendettas and seizing the Walled City.Kenji Tanigaki's inventive fight choreography is fluid and powerful, slightly exaggerating the character's comic book fighting abilities just right.The Kowloon Walled City set is exquisitely detailed, keeping with Soi Cheang's trademark of arranging garbage into intricately beautiful backdrops.The set design and fight choreography are well integrated and tell the story visually, with the characters scurrying through the cement crevices, alleyways, and scaffolding.Raymond Lam, largely known as a TV actor, shines in an iconic movie role and establishes himself as a solid action lead. As Tornado, Louis Koo gives solid support, building a memorable character separate from the star persona created from ubiquitous film appearances. Richie Jen's mob boss is the weakest link, lacking grit and veering into dress-up pantomime territory. Phillip Ng steals the show as the crazy laughing villain King.The one flaw is a gaping plot hole, an unexplained story contrivance of \"how did that character know that?\" The error wasn't obvious to me until after the film ended, but it hangs there like a jigsaw puzzle missing its last piece.Walled In is no masterpiece, but a well-executed crowd-pleaser that has entered the zeitgeist at the exact moment for the audience.In its quieter moments, Soi Cheang directs the audience's eyes toward the lives of the Walled City residents. Even though this is an exaggerated comic book film, it nostalgically refers to real history where people lived and struggled in these harsh conditions. This is the film's heart; it works in a \"look how far we've come\" way.Locally, the film's been the talk of the town, and everybody I know has seen it, some even more than once. It achieves a classic status that Hong Kong people will remember fondly, like a Bruce Lee film.",

The difference here is that they've really mastered it this time-although, I'll admit, there were a few moments that went completely over the top, almost to the point of being ridiculous!There was a point where I couldn't tell if the characters were supposed to be superhuman, because the stunts were absolutely insane. Turns out, they're regular people, except for the villain who's got some kind of mystical voodoo protecting him. So it begets the question, how are they so strong?But the ending? Total letdown.

I have absolutely nothing personal against Lau Chun-him, but asking him to play a rough-neck \/ gangster just doesn't cut it. Perhaps he'd be better suited for a gigolo or pimp (aka Goo Yeh Jai) type of role. Pfff~ At this point I wouldn't be surprised to see Keung B (Keung To) play Big Brother B in the next remake of Young and the Dangerous. :scoffs:In recent years, many on-screen villains elected to follow (or imitate)\na psychotic Joker but imho eccentric portrayals\/renditions are extremely hard to imitate. For it to work, you'll need to put your own unique spin to it, and that takes a very high caliber actor to pull it off. I am sorry, but Philip Ng has failed. Like they say: often imitated, but never duplicated\".= Visual Effects =\nThe visual effects are very poor. It looked like something that came out of an early 2000s HK movie. The action and the visual effects aren't in sync, and as such don't look\/feel natural; the depiction of superhuman feats performed where characters bounce across the screen and smashing into each other during fight scenes really ruined the film for me. It's just awkward! (For a fuller and better description on this point, please read the review titled \"Ruined by countless silly fight scenes\" by user andy-57995)= Action & Choreography =\nPassable at best. In the \"Making Of\"s I can see that a lot of effort has been put in, but the crappy visual effects killed it.= Cinematography =\nI'll give the cinematography a B because it does a good job at setting the tone.= Story =\nAs other users have indicated, the story was interesting; *some* of the characters are developed nicely and their relationships were well structured. Though, there were no romantic scenes and there are very few memorable interludes. Also, while I know it may sound a tad weird when i say this, but I can't help to mention that this film is missing a rape scene. If you are a fan of this genre in Hong Kong cinema, a rape (or attempted rape) scene is a signature of this genre tracing back to at least the 1970s. Why do I even mention this, you might ask? It's because I feel that it's a travesty that so many reviewers online are saying that this movie brought back old-flick vibes from the golden era of HK cinema. We will never again find certain elements or portrayals incorporated into a HK triad film, simply because the government won't allow it. This is an irrefutable fact. Anyway, I'll leave it at that.= Other thoughts =\n· After the clash between Louis Koo and Sammo near the end, the film lost all steam. The final fight scene is fk'n silly, looks goofy and the whole thing is cringy af to be perfectly honest with you. This brings back to my point about the young cast not being able to carry the movie on their own.· Sammo Hung's still got it. For someone who is 72 yo and needs a cane to walk, he's pretty impressive. They don't call him Dai Gor Dai (Big Brother Big) for nothing.3\/10 is a fair rating!",

But well, action is a man thing, no question.This one delivers an incredible package, full of high masculinity, kicks, punches, superpowers, unbreakable enemy, one vs 10s, gunfights, knives, hammers, deadly stunts, and so on...

I was pleasantly surprised by the interesting story and thrilling action and fight scenes in Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In. The fight choreography is terrific. The set design looks authentic; it recreates what the Kowloon Walled City looked like in the 1980s.The storyline is interesting but not overly complex. It's a bit bloody and violent but I am fine with it. The main actors Louis Koo, Raymond Lam, Sammo Hung, and Philip Ng all performed well; especially Philip, who has improved a lot since I last saw him in a TVB TV drama. I hope they make a sequel to this series.",

A world of movie I was so addicted with as a child and this blockbuster was a definite good comeback after hitting some slacks along the way anyways.This movie talks about love sacrifice and revenge in the best and absolute stunning way possible. Can assure you there aren't many good films like this out there in todays world. Definitely one of the fewest recent blockbuster where it delivers tremendously in every of it's stated genre; action thriller and crime. An absolute hit. All the characters did more than just deliver on this!A ten ten for me surely. Thanks to the directors producers and everyone else inbetween involved in putting this together.This movie was definitely worth watching right until it's very end.",

        "body":"I'm so happy to see a modern Hong Kong film that remembers it's a Hong Kong film and not a pretender to the throne, an action-packed homage to the nitty-gritty choreography-crazed neon-daze of '80s Hong Kong cinema, Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In is a long overdue and very welcome dose of ass-kicking goodness, hopefully signalling the start of a new wave. Packed with wall-to-wall bone-crunching, wall-shattering mayhem, dizzying feats of acrobatics and martial arts madness, the film might be a bit long but it's extraordinarily stylish, seamlessly edited and viscerally exciting. It's all directed to masterful effect by Soi Cheang, his nimble camera swimming through the walled city with a hyperkinetic frenzy that balances the excellent action that brings you closer to the edge of your seat with every punch and every kick and the misery enacted by neo-liberalism and cold vicissitudes of fate. A bittersweet dystopian canvas, but also the purest action machine built on the choreographed denial of physics. The cast is all excellent with veteran stars Louis Koo and Sammo Hung giving as good as they get, however, it's Philip Ng who makes the biggest mark as a cackling villain with supernatural abilities, even if his ascension to villain doesn't feel entirely warranted. The musical score by Kenji Kawai is utterly joyous and so typical of his masterful touch, I especially loved the use of Walking in the Air as part of the underscoring. If anything, Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In proves that Hong Kong cinema is far from dead, and not every film the country produces has to be subjected to a Mainland committee's scrutiny. It's easily one of the best action films of the year and I'm annoyed it took me this long to watch it.",

We have this fish out of water, self-discovery story with our main character. We have this gang conflict between those in the Walled City and the Triads. We have a revenge plot. We have a man dealing with his past-the growing of bonds. Unfortunately, the story is all incredibly predictable and lacks real depth. The constant talk about the past conflict sounded more interesting than the main plot. The ending is lacklustre and the final fight is so weird with the unexplained superpowers.However, if you like martial arts movies then there is certainly fun to be had here.",

        "body":"I never had any intention of watching \"Fifty Shades of Grey\"...none. However, when IMDB recently revamped their Bottom 100 List and I saw the movie was now on the list, I felt I had to see it. After all, I constantly am checking out the list to see what new additions there are so I can watch them. I do occasionally like seeing a bad movie...they can be very entertaining and unintentionally funny. Now \"Fifty Shades\" is very different from any other film on the list (with the exception of \"The Last Airbender\") in that it WAS a mega-hit and lots of people liked it...though at the same time its score of 4.1 on IMDB is anemic....making it a love-hate sort of picture.Anastasia Steele (great name, huh?) is a dim sort of lady....and I'm sorry but there's no better way to describe her accurately. When she goes to interview a big-shot businessman, Christian Grey, she has no idea what she's doing, hasn't prepared in the least and asks him only banal questions. She seemed rather dull and with little personality and it was difficult to see what he saw in her. Yet, despite this, inexplicably Grey is now obsessed with her. In some ways, he seems like a nice guy--such as coming to her aid when she's drunk in a dance club soon after this meeting. But in many, he gives so many signs that he's not normal in the least...and rather creepy and possibly very dangerous. He's incredibly controlling and in response to her getting drunk he says \"If you were mine, you wouldn't be able to sit down for a week\". In other words, for getting drunk and behaving stupidly, he'd paddle the crap out of her! He then has her sign a non-disclosure agreement--saying she'll never tell anyone about him!! Soon, they are embarking on a weird S&M relationship...and that's when the film shows a lot of nekkidness, though it's of the soft-core variety. But he is clear...this is NOT love and he doesn't want to be close to anyone...and he doesn't even want to actually sleep with her...just have his way with her.What I find so bizarre about the whole \"Fifty Shades\" phenomenon is that in the 21st century, the actions of BOTH Anastasia and Christian are the exact opposite of what society is telling us folks should be like or what romance should be. There really ISN'T any romance...and he doesn't want to date her. It's not so much just the S&M aspects that I found bothersome...it's more that you have a man who dominates a woman and controls her and she is passive and does whatever he says. Her needs are also not particularly important and he wants to control every aspect of her life and breaks into her apartment when she isn't home. This is NOT the feminist idea of today...at least not what folks SAY they want in a relationship. I simply do not understand this dichotomy...nor why folks loved the books and films...yet also claim to hate them! I also worry that a film like this could set the stage for date rapes, as here in the film it's supposed to be romantic...but in real life, it could get you imprisoned. Weird.So although I found the message strange and possibly dangerous and the writing occasionally silly, what about the techincal aspects of the movie? The movie is very polished--with lovely and very appropriate music, excellent cinematography and is very artistic. For this reason alone, although I didn't like or respect the message, the film deserves more than a few stars on IMDB. I should add that although the film features a lot of nudity, I really didn't find it all that exciting to watch...mostly because the film was just creepy. It also didn't come off as sexy....just creepy. And, it probably would NOT be a great date night film...as your date might think you are...just creepy. Watch it if you'd like...I just didn't particular enjoy it nor understand WHY it made so much money...I just found it, believe it or not, to be rather dull.",

Actually I don't think anyone believed they could make a good film, the producers just wanted the money that would come in from all people who for reasons known only to themselves read the book.I had a free ticket and I had to go in order to do a story on it. Bottom line, I'm not doing a story on it.Okay, here's the problem, and this is what breaks my heart. We no longer know what good or great is. I am no follower of Ayn Rand, but in The Fountainhead, she predicted the rise of mediocrity, mediocrity being considered great and the norm we shoot for. It only stands to reason that at this point, some things can't even rise to that sad level. This isn't mediocre, it's pathetic. I can't believe there are people complimenting the actors. But then I can, because they have come to accept mediocrity. Something I fight against with all my heart.There is one other problem. The book sucked; in order to like it, one had to use his or her imagination. The success of this book lay in the fantasy aspect. Sometimes imagination is more powerful than just about anything and can give you an erotic experience. This film doesn't fulfill the most inane imagination, let alone someone who really has a wild and creative one. The only fantasy it can give you is how fast you can get out of the theater.There were people around me laughing. The ones who weren't left, and from what I found out in the lobby, actually demanded and got their money back. When was the last time you saw people leaving a movie in the middle? I'm not sure I've ever seen it, and I'll guess I've been going to movies longer than a lot of you.I lament the loss of artistic soul, of creativity, of going for the best. I miss the days when Billy Wilder was a writer and a filmmaker. What are we left with but a horrible book written on a first grade level and the resulting bad movie.",

Camera work\/scenery\/etc. 7\/10 for what it is.. great camera work i guess and good sceneryRomance; 2\/10. I've seen the notebook... that's romance. This is a poor attempt to romance. It tries to tell you they're madly in love, but it's just a weird sexual relationship.Drama: 1\/10. there is no thrill.. no intense things going on. There is no drama in this soft-core-erotic-drama. \"The deeds\" 10\/10.. they did it. so.. can't give it any lower points than this. Overall, it's was horrible acted, plot-less, non-romantic nor drama movie about a girl being horny and the guy doing an attempt of BDSM, which comes down to.. soft-core.. almost nothing different than normal sex with bondage.. boring sh*t. on that note, go watch the kings man; secret service. that's one of the best action movies i've seen in a while!",

James best-seller about a shy, timid virgin (Dakota Johnson) who meets the elusive billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Doman) and soon both of their lives change.Writing a plot synopsis of this thing is pretty pointless since I'm sure the target audience is already going to know the story. I guess this is where I should admit that I haven't read the book so this review won't be comparing the two or complaining about what the movie did or didn't do from the book. No, this review is just going to be based around the actual movie and for the life of me I can't see what all the hype is about. I don't expect everyone laying their money down to be some sort of film buff but the \"shocking\" material on display here has been going on in European movies for four-plus decades so why it's just now reaching American shores is pretty funny in itself but that's off subject I guess.As for the film, there are all sorts of major issues with it but we can start with the laughable screenplay, which would have been rejected by the Lifetime channel and in fact, I'm going to guess that it would have been rejected has a five-year-old written it. The dialogue is without question some of the most laughable I've heard in a very long time. In fact, the movie seems to be lost in what decade it is because there are times that the \"F\" word is used and it's used in a way to where it's supposed to be shocking. Really? It's going to take more than that. The entire character development between the two lead characters is another joke and after a while you really can't buy into any of the melodrama and you've just got to sit back and laugh.The performances are another problem but then again, even the likes of Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor couldn't work with horrid material so I'm not going to be too harsh on Johnson and Doman. With that said, the lackluster direction by Sam Taylor-Johnson doesn't help either as there are many times where another take should have happened. The scenes with Johnson playing the shy girl just aren't very believable because the actress can't sell it. The scenes of her explaining she's a virgin are laughably bad. Doman really doesn't get much to work with and especially since he can't crack a smile and has to give off dumb, overly-serious facial expressions throughout. I will say that the actors have a nice chemistry together but that's about it. The supporting players are all equally forgettable.Yet another problem is that the film just isn't erotic. FATAL ATTRACTION, BASIC INSTINCT and even something as silly as BODY OF EVIDENCE are just a few recent films that packed a lot more punch than this one. I mean, is sticking an eraser around your lips really erotic anymore? A lot of the lack of erotic-ness has to be blamed on the director who just seems to have been the wrong fit for the material. Nothing from the erotic nature to the serious stuff works and everything is poorly edited.So, why the two-stars for all the negative stuff? As bad as the film is, thankfully it reaches the level to where you can't help but laugh and be mildly entertained as to what's going to happen next. Again, I haven't read the book so I don't know which one is better but the film is pretty flat from start to finish.",

        "body":"Before the review, I think I should address one important thing: I have never read the book. That being said, you will not read any comparisons or critiques of what was left out or what was done wrong in the adaptation. I went into this movie aware of the subject matter and judged it just like any other movie. Consider this a fair review of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\".Honestly, I liked this movie. I know what you're thinking: \"This guy just likes seeing people have kinky sex on the big screen.\" No, I don't. In fact, I think mainstream erotic films offer us more than just artsy porn; they can be a fascinating look into the human subconscious like \"Eyes Wide Shut\" and they can be pure garbage like \"Caligula\". I have come to learn that art is not safe whether it's in the horror genre, comedy or especially in the erotic subgenre. Strangely, I found \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" to be provocative of questions about love, compromise, and passion even if it borders on what most people would consider bad taste.First off, what is the movie about? Basically it follows the relationship between an inhibited English student named Anastasia Steele (played by Dakota Johnson) and a mysterious, young billionaire named Christian Grey (played by Jamie Dornan). They meet for an interview and begin building an infatuation for one another but Grey keeps insisting he does not want a romance with Ana. Instead he offers her the chance to partake in a BDSM relationship in which he is the dominant and she is the submissive. When I look back, the roles match well with their personalities.There is no real story I could find in this film; rather it's more about the characters. A lot of great movies focus on their characters more than plot; in this movie, it works out okay. Many of the supporting characters are snubbed for the two main players as if to say they are just there for the sake of some filler. Maybe if others found out about Grey's lifestyle and he was caught in media frenzy, the film would have a substantial plot.I found Dakota Johnson to be incredibly dull in the first act but gradually she becomes more dynamic and confident as the film progressed. It feels intentional seeing how Ana starts off as a quiet, uninteresting woman only to morph into a more liberal persona. Dakota's character has a lot of those \"whomp-whomp-whomp-whooooomp\" comedic moments in the beginning which felt so forced and unnecessary to the tone. Jamie Dornan was decent as Christian Grey. Like his character, he feels in control.The sex scenes are a lot tamer than I had anticipated going into this flick. Like the rest of the movie, they are shot surprisingly crisp and, might I add, nicely-paced.It sounds like a simple movie but it wasn't until I asked myself one simple question that it all became interesting: Does Grey love Ana? A lot of Grey's actions I see points to yes unless it is part of a ploy to secure a potential submissive. He claims to require a written contract before ever touching Ana but blows off this condition to passionately kiss her. And once they get to the contract, they discuss their intimate limitations in an amusing, business-like setting. Ana objects to certain practices which Grey seems to willingly extract from their relationship kind of like a compromise in any other relationship.One of my favorite parts is when Ana confesses her virginity to Grey after revealing his secret life. Even though he maintains he doesn't have normal sexual relations in the bedroom, Grey breaks this code to be with Ana. One might argue it is a selfish act to gain her trust so she may serve as his victim; I see it as Grey finding an opportunity to be with someone he could briefly connect with, someone untouched, someone he sees as good. In fact, at one point, he voices his concern of Ana changing his outlook on life and sounds scared of this prospect. Grey feels constrained by his past which shaped his present only to feel the need to constrain others to his level, literally.Who knows? Maybe I'm overthinking too much. Some people might be turned off, some might get turned on, some might think little about it, and some might find something special in \"Fifty Shades of Grey\". I only know what I saw and felt.My Rating: 7\/10",

I was in a positive frame of mind, and really in the mood to see what I thought would be a somewhat good if not better than mediocre film.This film is about two people who have no chemistry \"falling\" for each other. \"Falling\" like off a three story balcony leaving you without the use of your legs for the rest of your life. I'm just going to be blunt. This film is about GLORIFYING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE and a little girl in over her head who tolerates it. The man in the relationship, Chris, in a career-ending performance portrayed by Jamie Doormat, is a control-freak who must be in control in everything he does, including the life of his BDSM buddy, Ana.Not only does he creep onto her, HE BEATS HER, non-consensually while they have intercourse, he stalks her, HE INTIMIDATES HER and he shows no love for her. If this were any other film, he would be the antagonist. If you're in the mood for a movie that shows what true love is, I suggest you see Mrs. Doubtfire, as that film is about a loving family man who shows his dedication and support to his wife, even after they are separated, and his children, by dressing up as an elderly female babysitter. 50 Shades of Brown gets 1\/10 stars from me as I am unable to give A BIG FAT ZERO.",

I wanted to go and see this movie in the cinema, but all my friends trusted the reviews and just didn't come, so I went by myself. To be honest: I ended up crying for about 2 hours after watching the movie because I was extremely touched by Christian Grey's traumas. I feel like a lot of people don't get the point of this story. This movie is absolutely not about the erotics. It is about 2 people finding each other and falling in love, even though they both have no idea what it's like to have a 'normal' relationship. Anastasia actually sees Christian as a person, while Christian only sees himself as a monster. I do not have an opinion about any film technical aspects, simply because I do not have any knowledge about that.I can highly recommend this movie. But I must say: try to get to know the characters instead of focusing on the sexual action.",

        "body":"Seldom has an R-rated movie arrived in theaters with more pre-release hype, anticipation – and misunderstanding – than \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" (R, 2:05). What is billed and understood (at least by those who haven't read British author E. L. James' novel) as simply a story of a young woman being introduced to one man's sexual fetishes is much more – and much deeper – than one might expect. Nevertheless, the nudity, sex, and eroticism are on full display throughout the movie. This film, the book on which it is based, and this review are not for the faint-of-heart or the easily offended.Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson, daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson) is an attractive and intelligent college senior in Washington State who fills in for her sick roommate, Kate (Eloise Mumford) in interviewing billionaire business magnate Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for the college newspaper. Anastasia (Ana to her friends, except to Christian, who consistently uses her full first name) gets flustered in the presence of this young, sophisticated, supremely-confident and mysterious man. For his part, Christian is quite taken with Ana – and take her is what he soon decides he wants to do. He shows up at the hardware store where she works, takes her out to coffee and even comes to \"rescue\" her when she drunk dials him from a bar. Despite how obvious it is to the main characters and to the audience that these two are very, very different – and despite the title character's own conflicted resistance – these two twenty-somethings cannot resist each other.In most love stories, after setting up the situation like I did in that last paragraph, I'd say \"romance blooms\" (or something to that effect), but Christian very clearly states, \"I don't do romance.\" That doesn't stop Ana from being drawn to this man and wondering about the \"various physical pursuits\" he says he likes and his \"singular\" tastes, as he describes them. As Ana discovers more about the cipher that is Christian, she learns that he is wounded – both emotionally and physically – by his childhood. She seems to want to comfort this man who acts as if he needs no comforting and begins to love this man who tells her that he is only interested in her for sex.Being the woman in Christian Grey's life means submitting completely – sexually and otherwise – to his whims. As he eases her towards an understanding and acceptance of his lifestyle, she has to sign a non-disclosure agreement, he convinces her to have sex (actually \"f--- hard\", as he describes it) and then shows her his \"playroom.\" This usually locked room is painted dark red, has a bed and is filled with various restraining devices and implements of sadomasochistic sex play. Ana is shocked, but not necessarily repulsed. She's curious.Christian presents her his thick contract which describes Ana's prospective role as his submissive. He urges her to read the contract, educate herself on being a submissive and \"keep an open mind.\" She does all that, while Christian waits impatiently for Ana to make a decision. What follows is a complicated dance in which both parties kid themselves about how it's going. He seems confident that she's warming to the idea of being his sex slave and she is convincing herself that he is becoming boyfriend material. Ana does draw closer to Christian's world in fits and starts and Christian seems to be working harder to draw Ana in than he has probably ever worked before. No spoilers here, but eventually the true nature of each character does come out and the film ends with two words that carry more emotion than any six syllables I can remember hearing in any movie in a very long time.A given audience member's reaction to this movie will likely be influenced by how she or he feels about Christian's lifestyle, but evaluating this film solely on those criteria misses the point. Yes, the nudity and sex are enticing and anyone paying to see this movie for those scenes will be more than satisfied, but you'll get more than eroticism for your money. Much like \"Boogie Nights\", director Paul Thomas Anderson's engrossing 1997 meditation on the 70s porn industry, this film is an examination of human relationships. \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" is a love story, a parable of male and female emotional and sexual roles in the 21st century and an exploration of a lifestyle which many people know very little about, but very few know much. Basically, this is simply an entertaining movie. Casting little-known actors in the main roles is very effective and both show more emotional range than I expected from simply watching the movie's theatrical trailer. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson paces the movie well and she skillfully balances the film's salacious nature with its deeper meanings. \"B+\"",

        "body":"Hopefully, as a heterosexual female student in her twenties with a love of film that spreads across all genres and decades, this will come over as a fair assessment of a film that genuinely did nothing for me.Have not read the books, though have heard conflicting opinions that has mostly been intense dislike. The reason for watching 'Fifty Shades of Grey' was not due to wanting to hate on it, being a negative person, curiosity but for the reason of being at a film night with friends recently and 'Fifty Shades of Grey' happened to be the film choice. Just for the record, the general consensus ranged from indifference to hating it with a passion.There are two minor pros. The best thing about 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is most of the beguiling soundtrack, that has a soothing nostalgia and appropriately amorous quality, this is all for the song choices though. 'Fifty Shades of Grey' also looks good, nice use of scenery and very nicely shot.On the other hand, Danny Elfman's score is one-note and repetitive, as well as too derivative of his recent work. He has composed some wonderful stuff ('Edward Scissorhands' is magical) but this is really not his best work. The direction has slickness but overall is too mannered which really affects the film's tone and pacing.Regarding the acting, none of the supporting cast are of note, including Marcia Gay Harden, but a larger issue is the two leads and their complete lack of chemistry. Understated can be a lovely quality to acting, as long as it also becomes nuanced and with believability given to the dialogue. Dakota Johnson, especially in the first third, is too understated that it feels more like there is a lack of personality or emotion. Jamie Dornan looks uncomfortable throughout, delivers his cringe-worthy lines awkwardly and is just bland as dishwater with no charisma whatsoever. Chemistry is non-existent.'Fifty Shades of Grey's' dialogue does them absolutely no favours, dialogue so bad that absolutely nobody (even the best actors and actresses) can do anything with it. It causes unintentional laughter throughout, is embarrassingly clunky and is pure smut. Then there is the story that is so thin structurally, heavy in repetition, so badly plodding and without style or atmosphere that the film feels twice as long, with the sexual elements done far too tamely and the BDSM portrayal deceitful. None of the characters are engaging or interesting, practically ciphers.All in all, a very poor film with two minor pros and the rest of the film massively flawed. 2\/10 Bethany Cox",

I somehow got through 150 pages of poorly written boredom and gave up. I'm glad I saw the film for free. On the positive side, I can report that the Music is by one of my favorite film composers, Danny Elfman. Plus, the soundtrack includes music from the likes of Beyonce, Ellie Golding and many others which helps but does not rescue the largely silly visual acrobatics. Maybe my opinion would be different were I a repressed housewife or middle aged spinster. But that is as stupid a remark as the movie itself, given I am a man.",

I do not agree with the lack of chemistry either. There was a weird chemistry which I believe made sense because of the unusual relationship. He is an odd character and she is intimidated and is also very innocent therefore it isn't going to be the usual sexual chemistry that you would find in a romantic film. A lot of people have said there was not enough sex or it was not raunchy enough. Firstly, if there were any more sex scenes it would have got quite boring, and instead we got to see a bit of a story line. Also there is only so much that they can show in a film, surely? What were people expecting? Also one final point in relation to the comments I have seen regarding the film giving S&M a bad name; I don't agree. This is a specific story about one guy who is into specific things and goes about things a particular way. It was all consensual (and it is made clear that it must be). The whole point of the story is that Christian Grey's sexual desires are confusing for Anatasia to understand and that the relationship is quite complicated due to their mutual feelings for each other. I have also seen comments that this film is sexist and degrades women. This film does not promote that at all it merely shows a story of someone who practises in S&M and in this instance the man is the dominant. She has a choice as to whether she wants to engage in this and the film does not say \"this is okay\" and \"woman should do this\". The character was not forced to do anything. I do not get why people feel the need to accuse films of implying or portraying such things.Obviously this film is not perfect and there are things that could have been better but I enjoyed this film and personally would recommend it to others. I can get quite bored in films but I was not bored at all, I have paid more to see films that are A LOT worse than this.",

How could they say to their share holders that they passed on such a cash cow, allowing Warner, Fox or Sony to rake in the profits that this movie is guaranteed to make. The board meeting probably went something like this.\"We have an option on this book 'Fifty Shades of Grey- Now this one of the worst books ever to be written, but bear with me here, because this book is selling like hotcakes to desperate housewives everywhere. It's a no brainer we have to make this movie. The great thing is that we don't even need to make a good movie, it only has to be almost as good as the book, and since the book is so bad to begin with, that means that the bar is already set very low. We just can't fail. It's not Lord of Rings, the fan base isn't looking for great quality, if they were they wouldn't have bought the book in the first place, and that means we don't need to spend much money developing the script. Neither do we need to waste money on any A list talent. Forget Tom Cruise, and Keira Knightly, just get a couple or relatively unknown actors, they don't even need to be that good as long as they can remember their lines. And we don't need to budget for a great director either. Let's face it we are not remaking Citizen Kane here, so keep Spielberg and Scorcese for another project. Heck, we don't even need to pay out for someone like Ridley Scott and he'll pretty much do anything these days. No an unknown mediocre director will do, but make sure that the director is a woman as it will help to deflect any negative PR from those folks that think fifty shades glorifies domestic abuse and the like.Now here is the best part. Here is how we can make a ton of money out of this steaming dung pile. There are two days in the year when even the most Jockiest of alpha male guys who normally only watch action movies will happily take their significant other to see a chick flick. One is on her birthday, and the other is Valentines day. Since birthdays fall every day of the year, then February 14th has to be the release date. Oh and as luck would have it, Valentines day this year falls on a Saturday, so not only will all the male schmucks who think taking their girl to see this pic will get them laid later, all the single ladies who don't want to be stuck inside on this evening will come out to see this movie in droves with their girlfriends.

Mob psychology hit this movie real hard. Once a few people started dissing it, other people believed them and wouldn't judge it for what it actually was. This kind of story will obviously not appeal to everyone but it did for some so people need to stop ruining others fun. Now, for the real review, I thought the actors were great. They had their awkward phase together because they're starting a new relationship and he has a big secret to tell. NOT because they're awkward actors. Don't tell me that in real life that wouldn't be a little awkward. They played their growing relationship parts perfectly. I actually felt like I could know these actors BECAUSE they acted so well and made it seem like everyday life and not the glitz and glam acting of all the famous actors we've put on pedestals. The cinematography definitely worked for me. They made the movie come alive with the settings, lighting, and angles they used. The different scenes in themselves helped tell the story in a way words couldn't. I LOVE the changes they made from the book. I'll admit that I was not a fan of the books. The story was decent but I couldn't stand the writing. The movie made way more sense and it was easier to fall in love with the characters. I wish this could've just been made a movie from the start so there wouldn't have been so much bad press already out about it. I'll end now by saying I am very pleased with this movie and hope all the negativity won't prevent releases of the rest of the story.

        "body":"Perhaps appropriately, given its subject matter, Fifty Shades of Grey feels like two, distinct films grappling for dominance over the screen: one, a sensual and stylish romance about a young woman on a path of self-discovery, both in and out of the bedroom – and the other, a numbingly explicit Harlequin bodice-ripper brought to life, better suited for Cinemax's late night library than the multiplex. Unfortunately, the lesser one of the pair ends up on top, no doubt due to the creative stranglehold in which author E.L. James held director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel throughout the adaptation process, meaning that viewers get to be teased and titillated – then totally turned off (not to mention left with a severe case of blue balls, thanks to an anti-climactic ending that calls to mind an arcade game's \"Insert More Quarters\" display). In other words, Fifty Shades of Grey is a victim of behind-the-scenes drama, neither the glossy and intriguingly tragicomic tale of dangerous sexual politics Taylor-Johnson tried to make, nor the thoroughly smutty romance James clearly felt her story worked better as. Instead, tt's the limpest, most colorless hybrid of the two possible. Any true movie lover will detest James for holding a talented director back in her own little, pathetic show of dominance, though it's possible that some fans of the book may have lusted after an adaptation that, on the contrary, existed solely to allow for visualization of the author's most salacious sentences. That's for them to report. The fans already spoke once, back in the summer of 2012, turning James' novel into the fastest-selling paperback of all time, which suggests more readers share her fixation with raw sexuality than would like to admit.",

But little girls and horny housewife's will love it The directing, just went all over the place. The main focus was with aesthetics, no content what so ever.There are amazing love and or sex story's out there, this in not the case... now let's wait for part 2 and 3.

        "body":"\"Lifestyles of the Rich and Perverse\" might be a more fitting title for the unusually explicit bedroom drama.This adaptation of a trilogy of novels by E.L. James -- which features a modern-day Marquis de Sade as its male protagonist -- has a pornographically narrow focus and a potentially dangerous message.James, whose real name is Erika Mitchell, has apparently captured the imaginations of bored housewives everywhere by tracing the unlikely romance between socially awkward college student Anastasia and intimidating business tycoon Christian Grey.The popularity -- and notoriety -- of James' fiction is such that moviegoers know from the outset that the stumbling block tripping these two up, as they attempt to tango, will be Christian's fondness for whips and chains. Thus the duo's first interaction -- which comes about when Ana agrees to fill in for her ailing roommate Kate, a journalism major, by interviewing Christian for the campus newspaper -- is loaded down with dramatic irony.All Ana knows is that Christian has been tapped to deliver the commencement address at her pending graduation. But we're on to this dungeon-loving Bruce Wayne's real identity. So his sly double entendres are ever so much fun.In between the zingers, Ana and Christian fall for each other. Yet, as Ana tries to bond with her aloof new beau, she's perplexed by his total lack of hearts-and-flowers romanticism. Until, that is, she discovers that he's an obsessive sadist with an elaborately equipped \"playroom\" full of pain-inducing gadgets and restraints.Though it's framed in the familiar context of a good girl's crusade to redeem a naughty boy, Ana's eventual cooperation with Christian's perversion, risks conveying the idea that all women are potentially willing victims of physical abuse and humiliation. We're also left to wonder what role Christian's helicopter and fancy penthouse pad play in rendering Ana so tractable.While responsible viewers might sympathize with Christian's troubled background, both in childhood and beyond, as well as with his passing acknowledgement of the harmful nature of his proclivities, the intent to stir audiences by teasing a supposed taboo is unmistakable.Sadly, but essentially (at the risk of repeating) this 'fantasy' promotes all the worst things (mostly violence) on the \"person\" (esp women): ie: stalk, do harm (physically n psychologically), prostitute (money), pornography upon women .. and bring down the dignity of men anyway that's my piece... the movie is -10, but the chart doesn't have that option :-)",

I don't quite know how i can put across how bad this film is. My most accurate synopsis is that if you've ever watched a porn film, there will usually be (so I'm told ;-)) a terrible ten minute build up containing terrible acting, cheesy lines, and non believable attraction between the characters...imagine that for two hours and you have Fifty Shades of Grey in a nutshell. The whole affair just seems to fade into one long boring series of encounters, with very little substance to the story, and the supposedly 'steamy' scenes are about as arousing as a flash of your school dinner ladies drawers. The lad can act but his American accent is terrible and much like the book, the script is horrendous, he should sack his agent. the female lead is attractive but again i just don't buy that she would be attracted to the male, and if the film is based upon their fascination with each other, then it leaves you wondering why the hell you're sat there...you actually don't care if they get together.Its one of those films that just doesn't grab you from the start and it ultimately fails to pick up throughout, make no mistake, had it been at all possible, i would have left after 10 minutes, but i think my girlfriend (who also found it appalling), would maybe have scowled at wasting the money.Ill sign off with this: WOMEN: wait for the DVD, spend the admission money on a steak for your man, he will appreciate it more.

Apparently a lot of people have been watching this film for the dubious and much hyped reason that this film is supposed to be the greatest aphrodisiac ever recorded in human history . Indeed I almost fell out of my seat reading a report in the Scottish Daily Record that a woman in her thirties had been arrested in a Glasgow cinema for \"pleasuring herself\" ! Hold your horses guys because the paper didn't print a photo of the woman in question due to sub-judicial law so hoping she's going to pop back to the cinema for a repeat performance while she sits beside you is a little bit premature , she could have been a Gorgon for all we know . But I suppose 50 SHADES has something in its favour if audience members are going to risk 5 years on the sex offenders register watching it in public . I do hope the uncensored sex scenes are worth it because if the censored version is anything to go by that woman in the Glasgow cinema might have been pleasuring herself in order to stay awake The story itself is very one note . Unconfident virgin undergraduate Ana Steele embarks on a sexual relationship with 27 year old multi-billionaire Christian Grey . There's some strange casting going on here . Dakota Johnson as Ana really overplays the shy innocent virgin routine in the early part of the film and Jamie Doran never convinces as Grey . \"I don't do romance and I'm singular\" states Grey . How about \"I don't do acting and I have a single expression on my face throughout the entire movie\" Jamie ? Maybe if Grey was played by someone like a younger Christian Bale who can do a convincing turn as a manly Byronic anti-hero which is the casting that Grey calls for . The characters as played here just do not convince but to be fair to Johnson and Doran it's every aspect of the entire film that's the problem . It's directed by Sam Taylor Johnson who gives the entire mis en scene the look of a TVM on the Hallmark Channel complete with irritating incidental muzak playing over scenes . The source novel is probably complete garbage and if it is screenwriter Kelly Marcel hasn't improved it . Take this brief snippet of dialogue as Grey is just about introduce Ana to his S&M den \"This is my playroom\" states Grey \"You have an X-box in there ?\" Ana asks in all seriousness I know she's supposed to be an innocent virgin but would any young woman be that naïve ? My shopping list has as much chance for being nominated for an Oscar as this film does . Honestly I know sex sells but there's good sex and bad sex and in cinematic terms this really is bad sex and couldn't get much worse unless a self pleasuring Gorgon was sitting in the cinema seat beside you",

It was fun, romantic, if the sex scenes were passionate would be more nice to watch :D but the movie isn't about that so yeah, don't really liked that S&M scenes. Actors played really well. Jamie Dornan is so sexy OMG, that eyes on the big screen are like a sea.... I'm giving a rate 6\/10 because it was nice to watch but not so perfect. Yet, this 4\/10 rate is a little bit confusing. Everyone expects different things in the movie so you should see the movie if you want and not listen to anybody's opinion. I didn't read the book\/s but I got the storyline. Enjoy it :)",

The acting was horrendous. The guy who played Christian had an awful American accent. The scripting was as bad as the book. That leaves the sex scenes... Anyone who was expecting amazingly hot, crazy sex scenes will be sorely disappointed. The sex lacked any excitement. It was very boring really. I've seen sex scenes in films with a 15 age rating that are far more exciting. Basically, the whole film was a flop. I couldn't get over the amount of middle aged women giggling like young girls over Christian though.",

I was exposed to some of the pitiful writing briefly when I rode in the car with my wife while she had on the audio book. That predisposed me to expect absolute dreck from the movie. I was greatly surprised to find myself laughing early on--not at the movie itself, but at a particular moment in it that was intended to be funny. It was drawing me in, almost against my will. As it went on, I began liking the character of Anastasia. Christian may have been a little eye-rolling here and there, but I still bought into him. I get why some people are trashing this film--partly because the source material is absolute garbage--but it's actually a pretty interesting character study. I should add that my enjoyment of the film was increased because I watched it in a crowded theater. My wife and I were older than anyone else there. The reaction of the audience to the action (yes, the \"action\") on screen was invariably entertaining, sometimes hilarious. Keep an open mind, be a bit forgiving, and enjoy.",

        "body":"I'm kind of a movie's shark: sometimes I watch films simply because they are there, without knowing what they are about or who made them I eat them exactly like a shark. In these cases it is only after the end (and only if I got interested) that I go check about the authors, the reviews and so onThe present flick was one of those. And after watching the movie (which I found interesting) I went on IMDb and found that pages and pages in the review section were filled by angry or disgusted people who rated the movie 1! I'm talking about more than 1.000 reviews (no joke) which is without any doubt the reaction of scandalized souls. And this is the first interesting thing. The second is that all the authors were female (E.L. James who wrote the novel, Kelly Marcel who adapted it and Samantha Taylor-Johnson who directed it). And all of them already gave proof to be fine artists (and the present movie was not bad at all in its script, acting or direction). So, much of the criticism should be re-examined with a cooler mind.Finally, although this surely is an unrealistic film with unrealistic characters, it is essentially a love story and characters' unrealism is not significantly different from that of Oliver Barrett IV and Jennifer Cavalleri (remember Love Story?). Those two were separated by leukemia, the present ones by sex. Which author chose the most gentle and optimistic narrative element on your opinion?",

        "body":"Although occasionally tugging at the old sentimental heartstrings, A Quiet Place: Day One offers zero answers about what happened during the initial invasion.It's true, \"hiding the monster\" is essential in some cases, but we are now three movies in, know what they are, and we WANT to know more about them. But alas, nothing.The two leads are solid but given very little in the way of action because there is little to go on. The earlier installments, especially the first, had a way of steadily ratcheting up the tension from beginning to end, keeping the characters in what felt like genuine danger at all times. Not here; the monsters are always off someplace in the distance, like watching a Lion at a zoo that barely sticks his head out of his cave to take a bite, then goes back in for a nap.The fleeting moments when we see the monsters are technically impressive, showcasing the filmmakers' skills. However, it never feels like a danger to our two heroes or their cat. Maybe a little here and there?This isn't a terrible movie, and It doesn't feel like a \"cash grab\" when watching it. However, when you make a prequel billed as 'What Happens on Day One' and it doesn't show it, with little tension, no new territory covered, or answers given, it's hard not to feel disappointed.___September 2024 - Clearly the top three reviewers (I am currently in 4th) read my review first, even using my angles and terminology.

I didn't like that almost everyone learned to be quiet, off screen. So it was nothing we have not seen before. Characters trying to get from A to B (the point B, being stupid), whilst trying to be quiet.Keeping it spoiler free, the movie starts off with a huge reveal (not in the ad camping) regarding a main character, that robs the movie of something.Lupita Nyongo (brilliant, how does she not get more work?) and Stranger Things, Joseph Quinn (giving young Robert Downey Jr vibes) are both great and have good chemistry!! They share some nice, tender, human scenes (thought the script never makes it clear, why their characters connect so quickly and deeply) in what is a pretty sad and depressing movie. Not what was advertised, at all.The CGI looks good and there are a few genuine jump scares.This really doesn't seem like a franchise movie, it's much smaller in scale and scope (despite taking place in New York City, on the first day of an alien invasion) than the first two movies and that is a compliment, as it adds to the intimate and claustrophobic atmosphere, but from the trailers, his looked to be the biggest of them all.I will say, that cat was way too quiet. It constantly took me out of the movie, how quiet it was being.It sounds like I hated the movie, I didn't. It is a well made movie, with some fun action sequences that made me want to eat a margarita pizza. I just didn't love it, as much as I'd hoped and I think it's a missed opportunity.",

Nah... me neither, but I'm pleased to say that this seemingly unnecessary prequel is a lot better than it has any right to be. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it is my favourite of the franchise so far, helped in no small part by excellent performances from its two stars, Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn, who play two survivors of the initial attack who must work together to try and survive long enough to get pizza.Nyong'o stars as terminally ill Samira, who is in New York City when the aliens arrive. When the authorities destroy the bridges out of Manhattan to prevent the creatures from spreading, Samira decides to head to her favourite pizza parlour to enjoy a few last slices before her illness claims her life. Quinn plays fellow survivor Eric, who helps Samira achieve her final wish.The film works on two levels, successfully combining scenes of heart-pounding tension with heart-tugging drama. There's plenty of well-executed alien action for those who enjoy suspense and scares, but the human interaction is also very effective, Eric not only helping Samira with her physical journey to Patsy's Pizzeria, but also with her emotional journey from resentful and bitter to selfless and content. Also expect a great turn by a furry performer, Samira's very cute cat.The film isn't perfect - there are moments when certain noises conveniently don't attract the immediate lethal response they usually do; the moggy magically manages to avoid drowning (or do cats hold their breath when under water?); and a touching note written by Samira is still legible even after being completely submerged - but these are minor niggles.

And the scenes where the herds would race through the streets carried a weight not felt in the other AQP films.

Some moments just feel out of nowhere and some moments\/characters seem so wasted and could have helped the storyline that bit more. Good enough watch, but don't have high expectations.",

I was also very excited to see the cast of Day One come to life in the world of A Quiet Place. However, I felt let down. I felt like there was a world of deep and beautiful story telling to be had in this prequel, not to mention the thrill of the monsters. Yet, it lacked what could have been both gripping and heartfelt. The cast did their best, but they weren't given the room to truly shine. And I wasn't on the edge of my seat the way I was with the first and second. I was hoping to see something new, to learn about the monsters, to be connected to new characters. But I came away feeling none of that. Granted, it was still a decent film. I am still happy I saw it in the theater.

        "body":"As I read the reviews here I see quite a bit of negativity. Most of that seems to be based on the same droll complaint: \"It isn't what I wanted it to be.\" People were looking for an explanation of why the aliens attacked, one guy mentioned wanting a tank battle (hey, go watch Transformers), others were upset that they didn't delve into the agenda of the aliens. Basically, these reviewers wanted an origin story... and were disappointed that's not what they got. While I can understand their complaint... they didn't write the story, make the movie, and weren't in charge of the plot line. If they had been, we'd have all missed what this movie really presented.This is not an origin story, nor was it intended to be. It wasn't created to fulfill personal whims. They don't explain why the aliens invaded or their agenda BECAUSE THE CHARACTERS HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING THAT. That's the bottom line of that issue. Maybe the next in the series will tell more about the aliens but frankly, that's not really necessary. All three of these movies have been about ordinary people dealing with the unknown as best they can. That's the premise, en total. The imagined origin of the aliens has never been the main point of these movies. The aliens appeared outta nowhere, attacked for unknown reason, are very dangerous but not invulnerable. People learn how to cope. That's it. The origin of the aliens is completely irrelevant to the plot of all three movies.Every one of the negative reviews seem to be missing a very vital point in this movie: it is about a very ill woman dying of a disease (likely cancer) with evidently little time left... while at the same time dealing with a deadly alien invasion. This paradox is the entire crux of this movie, and is very important to the overall plot. Imagine yourself in this situation... facing death no matter what... and what would be the most important thing on your mind? Most of the reviews reveal this: pizza. Her \"last wish\" so to speak. Last wishes are something we all totally understand. This strong desire was established very early in the movie, and that remains the fulcrum throughout the film. The movie even explains the reason... and it's a very good one.This isn't a deep probe into alien psyche. It's about two people who have just met, trying to deal with one very drastic day as best they can. They don't have time to plan. They aren't \"die hard\" samurai warriors. They're just regular people with their own problems: one has cancer and the other is evidently suffering from PTSD and doesn't know how to cope by himself. There's no telling what he'd already seen that day, what he'd had to deal with. So now... how are they going to cope with this situation?This film catches the viewer's attention from the start and holds it to the very end. No, it's not the best movie ever... but it's very good and far above the jaded 1 & 2 star ratings we see here. The scene is set, the characters are presented, and the director proceeds to take us on two people's journey that single day... from the primary viewpoint of those two characters. They hold true to this premise throughout the film.This is primarily action \/ adventure... but a step above as they reveal more about the characters themselves (which for once are very well developed and acted). Whether one \"likes\" how this resolves or not, the resolution is realistic and understandable. This is basically a slice-of-life sci-fi about the very first day of this alien invasion, no explanations other than \"Here they are, now what do we do?\". From that standpoint, it works.",

The few alien scenes are intense and bring you to the edge of your seat. The set design is done great.The biggest part where it went wrong, and really annoyingly disturbed me, was the writing... on 2 occasions:1) I thought it was a great move to do a prequel, when I first heard about it, cause I did want to know more about the aliens and first attacks. It would bring the franchise more depth. But, you receive nothing new. It is literally day one. Here we are... now run!It could've been smarter, had a good lay out or easter egg, to maybe tie it in, into chapter 3. It was a very stand alone movie, with only a cameo of Djimon Hounsou.2) I know a lot of people call the cat, the star of the movie. But the animal barely miauwed one time in the whole movie. It walks and runs around freely half of the time itself, and jumps onto things... it never makes a sound? And then on different occasions it comes in contact with water, one time even going fully under, and comes back up like it had a lovely jacuzzi bath. I don't know any cat which loves water that much. And on another occasion the cat sniffed it's way, all the way to it's owner in an unknown territory, a few blocks away. It just doesn't make sense, and was too farfetched for me. It took me out of the story, and quite frankly fell like an after thought to add the animal to the story, as it has not much purpose in the movie.I'm still looking forward to the next part, and see where they will take it now. But this movie missed a few marks for me.",

However this overall story could've probably been consolidated into more flashbacks in the second film when they were delving into that aspect.The aliens are still gruesome and as rapidly visceral as they always have been, so that is the main constant of their film. The visuals are incredible albeit cgi is much heavier in the city scape with more broad daylight scenes. The origin is substantially crafted and answer a few questions. The issues I have are with the main characters being extremely dull and interesting. Whether it be slightly poorly written or just plain uninspired performance, they don't capture the attention at all. If they thought those 2 will be a good fit they were wrong.

How easy it would have been for Lupita's character to just scream her lungs out and allow the aliens to end her misery.As an examination of the indomitable human spirit while under the most unimaginable duresses possible, this film delivers just fine.Rate films for what they are.

Despite the somewhat perplexing complaints from movie-goers that I'd read, I found the film to be truly good.First and foremost, in the original film you are quickly educated about the aliens - silence or death. Secondly, the original film is about a rural farm family (at least they are when the film opens...they could've come from somewhere else entirely...).In 'Day One' we get to see the rapid collapse of society in the well-known urban setting of New York City. The terrifying images of the aliens falling from the sky with military jet fighters hopelessly trying to shoot them down. A frenetic sequence of violence and carnage leading up to the film's sting. \"A Quiet Place\". \"Day One\". Fantastic opening.The cast was excellent, but Lupita Nyong'o set the bar in this film - make no mistake. They could've just made this like 'Fear the Walking Dead' - more people in danger, different place. But they gave the lead character a different arc, and it worked very well. It played into the story with a different tone.Now, let's talk about Frodo. I have a cat that makes almost no noise - so she would not be a liability. But Frodo was damn near supernatural. I believe they intended for the cat to be mystical in some way - leading Eric to Sam, leading Sam to the aliens' feeding ground, etc... some kind of biblical metaphor. Frodo was leashed - which is weird for cats. But he went along willingly and loyally... The whole thing was fascinating.If you're on the fence about this one - don't listen to the popcorn crowd. This film delivers. And without spoilers, I'll say - it ties in well with the originals.",

They ruin it.The power in the two previous movies was that it could transmit horror and action in silence. Day one lacks that power. It transmits nothing of what was expected. The background story chosen for the character and the motive that triggers her quest is absurd in that context.Djimon Hounsou was completely wasted. After watching him in the island and then reuniting with him in the past you would think that his role must be rich to deserve a \"second chance\" to be in both movies. Well, he doesn't go any further than any other stunt in the story.Let's avoid getting picky and let's not mention the cat and it's exaggerated and forceful mute activity, mainly in the water, when drowning. No claws, no meows of any kind, so favorable to the script.When people are trying to survive, the worst and the best come out of them, but under no circumstances would they take you to the riskier areas, away from survival, to eat cold pizza. Darwin said it a long time ago: it's the survival of the fittest. The fit ones won't follow the unfit as their leader.Nothing in this movie makes sense, and so far we could overlook this if the action narrative had been more sensible. No ships attracting the creatures from the water and shooting? The quick realization that the creatures are blind and guide themselves only by sound and dread water?We knew all this from the other two movies. It was stated. Now we needed to see how they found out. How long it took them. Apparently, less than five minutes.A total letdown that could have been the survival movie of the decade, similar in relevance as I am legend.Let me reformulate that: A total waste.",

There are genuine attempts throughout to be a horror film, and each time it is poorly executed.

It's really a powerful \"end of the world\" drama with commentary about the gritty parts of life... and death.

The film bleeds thematic elements and I'm there for it. So much of the film is frankly fantastic.That being said, the problem with this film is it genuinely tries to be terrifying\/suspenseful at crucial points in the film, so the overall package is critically flawed. The cheap fake out jump scares and frankly at times silly chase sequences are ultimately foundational parts of the whole package.Still, this film is honestly great at most moments, especially when it's forgotten about trying to be intense and is focusing on the analysis of the very human characters.",

This film has helped me realise just how good the execution was in the first two films directed by John Krasinski. The concept isn't actually all that conducive to a good film, they were just made so well we didn't realise. This prequel however showed all the flaws in the concept.Where to begin? Firstly, we are introduced to our lead character and she is shown to be a highly unpleasant person. She even says so herself. So that's fun spending 100 minutes trying to find the motivation to care about her. Then along the way we meet another character and he is about as annoying as human beings come. They had a cat though. That was a nice touch. I did care about the cat.So we have two characters who I don't care in the least about and the film tries to turn itself into a drama. There are sprinkles of \"horror\" but it's never threatening and every scene with the monsters in it feels exactly the same.Also the monsters are incredibly inconsistent depending on which character makes a noise. If it's a disposable side character then the slightest squeak means instant death. If it's the lead characters a giant crashing noise doesn't matter because they have plenty of time to run before the monsters bother to show up.This film made me realise just how boring the monsters in these movies actually are. They really are the definition of a one trick pony. Every scene they are in is exactly the same and there is nothing fresh to be done with them.I didn't like this film much at all. It felt longer than the 100 minutes it was and I was bored almost the entire time. Not one I'd recommend. 3\/10.",

        "title":"A worthwhile origin story\/spin-off that establishes the beginning of a world turned silent",

        "author":"MrDHWong",

        "body":"\"A Quiet Place: Day One\" is a prequel to the 2018 suspense horror film \"A Quiet Place\" that serves as the third installment in the series. Co-written and directed by Michael Sarnoski (\"Pig\") and starring Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn, it is a worthwhile origin story\/spin-off that establishes the beginning of a world turned silent.In New York City, Sam (Lupita Nyong'o) lives alone amongst the hustle and bustle of her urban environment, preferring to keep to herself rather than interact with others. While Sam is out and about one day, the city is suddenly invaded by blind, lightning fast extraterrestrials that hunt their prey based entirely on sound. To contain the problem, the US government immediately orders all bridges leading out of Manhattan to be destroyed, trapping Sam and several other people with the monstrous alien creatures. As she narrowly avoids attracting the creatures' attention, Sam soon crosses paths with Eric (Joseph Quinn), a young law student desperate to escape the city along with her. Using only their wits and quick thinking, Sam and Eric work together to navigate the confined island in an effort to cross the water and reach the safety of the mainland.To my surprise, the success of the 2018 film \"A Quiet Place\" has now resulted in the emergence of a media franchise, with its first continuation released three years later. Although I still think the original works just fine as a standalone film, \"Part II\" nonetheless managed to expand upon what was previously established by introducing some important elements that allowed for more world building within this silent society. As a result, the groundwork had now been laid out for further additions to this story, including learning about the strengths and weaknesses of the alien monsters terrorising the Earth. In the spin-off\/prequel film \"A Quiet Place: Day One\", we see the very beginning of this extraterrestrial invasion from the perspective of two people who are forced to remain quiet at the risk of losing their lives.The exact timeframe of the film is unclear, although judging by the fact that Sam is seen listening to an iPod Classic, it can be assumed that it takes place sometime in the 2010s before the events of the first movie. As opposed to the rural setting of the previous two films, this one takes place in the concrete jungle of New York City, a location where loud noises and other cacophonies are an everyday occurrence. On that note, at the very start of the film, we are even informed that a typical day on the streets of New York will expose a person to 90 decibels of sound, equivalent to someone repeatedly screaming in your face at top volume. Our protagonist Sam, who is desensitised to this constant noise she hears on a daily basis, soon realises that the city is now under attack by an alien threat, but like everyone else she is too caught up in the chaos to figure out how to elude their advances. Sam is later informed by a small group of survivors that these creatures have ultra-sensitive hearing, which alert them to anything they can attack at an extreme speed. To make matters worse, Sam and the city's other remaining inhabitants discover they are trapped on the island due to all the bridges being destroyed, leaving them as prisoners along with creatures who can kill them instantly upon making the slightest audible sound.After it is discovered that the monsters cannot swim, those trapped on the island all mutually agree that the best solution would be for them all to walk as quietly as possible towards the water to board any available ship heading to the other side. Although things seem to go well at first, this is soon ruined by someone accidentally brushing past a parked car that sets off the alarm, alerting the monsters to their location and mass panic erupting. Amidst the chaos of people being devoured and collateral damage to nearby buildings, Sam tries her hardest to seek shelter through the smoke but while doing so she becomes covered in ash and soot from all of the destruction occurring all around her. Since the film is set in New York City, it appears quite obvious that this imagery is meant to allude to the 9\/11 attacks, as there is clearly no other comparison that can be drawn here. At first glance, this might seem disrespectful to the victims of the real-world event but I interpret its inclusion as a way of showcasing the resilience of the citizens of New York who survived a near-death experience despite the pandemonium occurring all around them.Like its predecessors, the film makes great use of its sound design to frighten the audience through the combined efforts of building suspense and setting up situations that could easily go wrong for the characters involved. For instance, in the scene mentioned above, we see several hundred people walking in unison with their feet quietly treading in sync with each other to avoid detection from the creatures. Along their way, we see the various hazards on the ground they could encounter, including accidentally splashing in a puddle to kicking a small rock of gravel by mistake. Every step these people take, every object they pass by, and every surface they walk upon holds many risks that put them all in danger of being ripped to shreds by the monsters at any given time. As a result, it's hard not to feel a sense of anxiety watching our two lead characters navigate the sprawling metropolis of New York City while simultaneously trying to make as little noise as possible.Though this series of films has never really had any deeply written characters, I've always liked how we still care enough about them to hope they make it to the very end. With that said, I think Lupita Nyong'o does a fine job in the lead role as Sam, whose determination to outsmart these monstrous creatures is a perfectly valid reason for us to hope she survives. It's interesting to watch as Sam sets aside her personal aversion to others in order to figure out how she is going to make it through such a large scale apocalyptic event. This makes her interactions with Eric so much more engaging as we see the two of them work in collaboration to come up with a plan to reach the mainland unharmed.Joseph Quinn is also nice enough in the supporting role of Eric, a British expatriate law student in the wrong place at the wrong time. Due to his limited understanding of this foreign city, Eric requires a local like Sam to guide him through the unfamiliar environment of New York City, which is now hampered by the fact that it is overrun with sound sensitive monsters. Since verbal dialogue is limited and nobody uses sign language like in the previous films, we see the two communicate mostly through hand signals or by writing things down on a piece of paper. Despite having practically nothing in common with Sam at first, it's nice to see the pair grow closer over the course of the story, making their otherwise unlikely relationship so much more endearing to watch.If you enjoyed the anxiety-ridden suspense of the first two films, then \"A Quiet Place: Day One\" once again delivers the goods on every front. It keeps the audience on its toes as the tension continues to mount over time while it also contributes some necessary world building elements to enhance its entertainment value. Like with the other two, this film absolutely needs to be experienced on the big screen with surround sound for maximum effect, as I can't imagine it achieving the same impact when watched on a small TV or a smartphone. According to some research, a fourth entry is in development that is set to serve as the conclusion to the entire series. So long as it finds a way to end this whole saga on a high note, then we have nothing to worry about.I rate it 8\/10.",

The sequel was good but didn't introduce anything new in terms of world-building or character development. Now, with this latest film, I think it's time to wrap up the series. While this movie isn't bad by any means-it remains very watchable with solid acting and consistent tension-the concept feels exhausted.Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn stand out with their excellent performances, relying heavily on physicality and facial expressions due to the minimal dialogue. However, that's where my positives end. The concept, as I mentioned, has run its course. I had hoped that since this film focuses on the beginning of the outbreak, it would explore how people adapted to the new reality or learned to combat the monsters. Instead, it rehashes familiar territory.For newcomers to the franchise, this movie might serve as a decent introduction since the earlier films are superior and offer more depth. However, as a third installment, it left me quite disappointed.",

Similar to the first 2 films, it is shot and written in such a masterfully way that you find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat just praying that the main characters will pull through. Sarnoski did a brilliant job of showing the absolute chaos that ensued during the invasion and really bringing to light the terror that the characters are feeling. Nyong'o' s performance is harrowing and with this film she has cemented herself as a scream queen.A Quiet Place: Day One is a fast-paced, thrilling, and emotional movie that is worthy of the first 2 films of the Quiet Place franchise.

Schnitzel and Nico, the cats who played Frodo, were excellent actors and honestly stole the show from their human colleagues.That said, the focus on Frodo as the central character was unexpected and did detract from the horror nature of the film. There were scary moments, but it was more of an adventure movie starring a cat than horror. Given this, it's kinda messed up that the cat wasn't featured at all on the poster or given higher billing.

His character had a cartoonish, over-the-top, somewhat childish behavior scheme that just wasn't believable.I blame this misstep on the man setting the film's tone, director Max Barbakow. This was a massive step backwards from his most recent film \"Palm Springs\" which was quite enjoyable.The relationship between Brolin and Dinklage, our titular \"brothers,\" felt forced and, at times, dull throughout the film. Their arguments felt scripted, which is the exact opposite of what you want to feel in a film. I was never invested in their familial development because the writing never evoked those feelings with the audience. In short, the lackluster writing was only exacerbated by the sluggish on-screen chemistry.It might be worth the watch if you've run through the many streaming catalogs available but shouldn't be at the top of your to-do list.4\/10.",

Brolin shows range playing a believable character who isn't a tough guy with super powers. Marisa Tomei is great in everything. I wonder why she was uncredited. Fraser even pulled off the shady guard. Never been a fan of Glenn Close, but her prime was before my era. Brothers fails to draw you in.

No chemistry other than dislike between characters. Just no heart!The bones are good, and there's potential, but it's just underbaked. I can even see where things should have been funny, but the opportunities are missed again and again and again. Characters make moronic decisions, and so apparently did the creators.With a solid gold cast there is just no excuse for this being so bad!My entire family thought this looked good, but none of us enjoyed it. We got bored. We waited for it to get better, but no luck.It's like a bad 90's comedy, but probably would have been forgettable even then.Such a shame.",

If you aren't judging as a critic and just as a general viewing experience I feel like it was definitely above average these days. Parts were cheesy and crude but in almost an early 2000s feel. I found it to be an easy watch and enjoyed the performances of the actors involved. I can understand the disappointment some people may have with this movie. Some parts are a bit formulaic. I definitely think it's not meant to be art(film) but just a movie(entertainment).

The movie was shot in a way that really complemented the story and gave certain scenes a bit of extra depth and charm.

It's at least inoffensively low quality and has a memorably gross scene worthy of the Farrelly brothers.This cast is massively over qualified for what this is. Josh Brolin & Peter Dinklage can keep this going for as long as needed (just about) even if their rapport lacks the spark to make it truly memorable. Glenn Close proves she's willing to do anything however it's not a good thing in this case and Brendan Fraser is by far the best thing about this with a manic energy which briefly brings the film to life whenever he appears.Max Barbakow's direction is thoroughly low energy to the extent it's hard to believe this is the same director who made the brilliant Palm Springs. It just goes through the motions without anything of merit apart from the one scene involving a fairly uncanny CGI Orangutan. The most noticeable set piece that misses the mark is the chase across a golf course which is deliberately slow and still lacks any spark.",

In addition each character, was just that , a character, and played to over the top, which fits this type of movie perfectly, and you can't take it too seriously, but then there are times it just misses. You see what they were going for, and ...it just doesn't make it. Peter Dinklage is the only reason this movie is worth seeing. There are some impressive dialogues in the movie, so if you are serious movie fan, that like to take the higher road, analyze, evaluate, feel the emotions, this might be the one for you. There is certainly opportunity there. If you are looking for pure entertainment, I can see where a certain mind set would find it funny.

        "body":"Joel and Ethan Coen are known for their ability to give their characters funny names, which can be a delicate art. In Brothers, the brothers Moke Munger (Josh Brolin) and his brother Jady (Peter Dinklage) are given nonsensical names by a crooked guard, Farful (Brendan Fraser), on the condition that he cut them in on some missing loot long hidden by the boys' criminal mother. The differences between these monikers and genuine Coen creations like HI McDunnough (from Raising Arizona) or Burt Gurney (from Hail Caesar!) are as precise and important as the difference between actual Coen brother Ethan Coen and veteran screenwriter Etan Cohen, who has a story credit on the movie. Brothers is a road-trip crime comedy that telegraphs the brothers' aspirations with its colorful backstories and wannabe-wry narration from Dinklage. The brothers' brash, scheming brother and cautious, more emotional brother bicker through cartoonish, outlandish, and unfunnyish antics, including a smoking ape at one point. Director Max Barbakow frames some well-timed sight gags, but the writing is far less inventive than expected from screenwriter Macon Blair, who starred in Blue Ruin and wrote Hold the Dark. While Brothers has plenty of momentary amusements, it is not enough to create a cult crime comedy out of almost nothing. On its own meager terms, Brothers passes by zippily enough, running about 83 minutes, barely enough time to stop it from auto-playing on Prime Video. Amazon Prime has recently embraced the wacky action comedies genre, with films like Brothers by Max Barbakow. The film, directed by Palm Springs director Max Barbakow, is a wildly entertaining example of how to do it. The well-chosen cast of A-list actors, including Josh Brolin and Peter Dinklage, plays fraternal twins, with Glenn Close as their conniving grifter mother. The movie follows the story of Jady and Moke, who were rambunctious twins who were in trouble for robberies and other mischief. Jady ends up in prison, while Moke goes straight and marries Abby. When Jady is released from prison, he returns to the twins with a job: retrieving $4 million in jewels buried away by their mother, Cath Munger. Cath promises equal riches for all in leading the boys to this buried treasure. A crazy road trip ensues, with an unhinged Jady and a reluctant but intense Moke, inspired by Midnight Run. Brothers is a movie about family, with a well-chosen cast and a slapstick style that delivers a thrilling and entertaining experience.",

The convoluted plot focuses on fraternal twins Jady and Moke Munger who agree to retrieve a stash of emeralds abandoned by their mother Cath, who went on the lam over thirty years before. Jady is a lifetime convict sprung from prison early by corrupt Judge Farful who has his inept corrections officer son James tail Jady. Meanwhile, years of resentment between the brothers spill over into the expected shenanigans, chief among them a bittersweet reunion with their mother on the run again after escaping prison. Glenn Close as the hardened Cath is the latest in her series of white-trash mothers, but she's not given enough funny one-liners to justify her esteemed presence. Peter Dinklage lends his familiar wry humor to Jady, but Josh Brolin appears more on overdrive as the more fearful Moke. However, his performance is nothing compared to the broad, over-the-top turns by Oscar winners Brendan Fraser as James and Marisa Tomei as Jady's prison pen-pal love interest who inexplicably owns a gay orangutan.

        "body":"For whatever reason, genuinely funny comedies have become an increasingly rare cinematic commodity in recent years, so it's a real treat when one comes along that satisfyingly tickles the funny bone. Such is the case with director Max Barbakow's third feature effort, the wild and wacky tale of a dysfunctional crime family seeking to recover the hidden loot from a heist carried out by the family matriarch (Jen Landon) 30 years earlier. Leading the charge are twin brothers Jady (Peter Dinklage), a career criminal recently released from prison, and Moke (Josh Brolin), a gifted but long-reluctant thief who's now trying to go straight. The goal is to find a retrieve a stash of emeralds stolen by their long-absent mother (Glenn Close), who originally pilfered the goods but has been on the run ever since - and who now shows up out of the blue to collect the gems for herself. The unlikely trio thus launches their quest to get the jewels, an odyssey finding them aggressively pursued by Officer Farful (Brendan Fraser), a crooked prison guard who arranged Jady's early release through his father, a corrupt judge (M. Emmett Walsh in his penultimate screen performance), in exchange for a sizable cut of the stash. And, along the way, the parties to this wayward caper bungle themselves through an array of inventively inspired comic challenges that include Jady's spacey new girlfriend (Marissa Tomei), Moke's pregnant wife (Taylour Paige) and an unusually randy gorilla, among others. It's also a cautionary tale in the notion of there being no honor among thieves, even when they're members of one's own family. While some of the film's segments are obviously a little overwritten and overplayed (especially by Fraser), much of this romp plays fairly well, reminiscent of one of the Coen Brothers' movies (though admittedly not quite as polished). If nothing else, though, it represents a huge step up from the filmmaker's last outing, the positively horrendous \"Palm Springs\" (2020) (my worst film of that year), as well as a major improvement over many of Amazon Prime's recent disappointing offerings, an accomplishment largely made possible by the performances of its stellar ensemble cast (particularly the three principals). \"Brothers\" isn't epic filmmaking by any means, but it's a good way to get some hearty laughs at home on a Friday night with a big bowl of popcorn, and that's pretty satisfying all by itself.",

Unlike Max Barbakow's previous film Palm Springs which offered an interestingly romantic take on a time loop with fascinating characters, this flick purely rides on the uneasy equation between the brothers and their mum. Brolin and Dinklage do make for a fun pair, with Glenn Close rounding out the trio that's seemingly up to no good. But the film doesn't take many storytelling risks, sticks to the basics of what constitutes a dysfunctional family, providing some one-liners and slapstick humour (courtesy Fraser's dirty cop), ultimately treading familiar paths even when the heist elements take over. It's definitely a few steps down from Palm Springs, but I still have faith in Barbakow as a filmmaker when it comes to handling comedy.P. S.

It took me about twenty minutes to get into it. Partly because it was a different tone than I expected. Partly because of the script (or maybe the editing). But there was enough to make me hang in there. Then everything starts to come together. It's not a brilliant, surprising script. But there are some really funny scenes. The acting is great. Brendan Fraser, who's still in 'The Whale' shape, is really good. Glenn Close can shapeshift and be any character. All in all it left me with a big smile on my face.",

Emmet Walsh famous for Bladerunner is hilarious in his comedic role in the brothers movie. There is a very funny scene that plays out with the foreshadowing that happens when Brolin is waiting in a room for his brother when another character enters and slowly closes the door. Not going to spoil it. It's a great set up and circles back when similar happens later on but is condensed as it allows our minds to fill in the rest. The response from Fraser is great and lovable and funny. It does have a typical storyline with some twists and has good pacing so you're not left to fast forward the first time watching this. I say this because my 2nd time watching it was scenes with Fraser and a hilarious scene with Brolin. What played on the tv during that was a fantastic choice to increase laughter and let the mind fill in the rest. In the end it's a feel good movie with some laughs.",

Watching Dinklage and Brolin in their roles as the dysfunctional Munger brothers offers fun character dynamics, and the whole cast brings a strong presence to the screen. Fraser, in particular, adds an unexpected flair to his role as a corrupt prison guard. However, the plot struggles to keep up with the caliber of its cast. The story tries to deliver a chaotic, dark-comedy vibe but ends up feeling forgettable and disjointed. After the final scene, you might find yourself thinking that it's more of a \"watch it, then forget it\" experience.Some aspects push the film off-track, especially the odd and controversial addition of a CG orangutan involved in bizarre antics that don't fit well with the film's tone. Such scenes detract from what could have been a solid narrative with this stellar cast. You can tell the actors enjoyed making the movie, but the weak script means that enjoyment doesn't fully translate to the audience. It's a missed opportunity-Brothers could have been a standout if it had a plot worthy of its impressive lineup of actors.In short, it's worth a watch if you're a fan of the cast, but don't expect it to leave a lasting impression.",

As someone who turned on this movie specifically because I loved Josh Brolin in Sicario, No Country for Old Men, and pretty much everything else he's done, this film showed he has incredible range and chemistry with anyone you put in front of him.It would be tragic if Brolin and Dinklage didn't at least do a couple more films together. I acknowledge that due to Dinklage's stature that itte dynamic may begin to feel contrived, but if the writing and directing is up to par with this film, it wouldn't matter.I often find that the largest gap in comedy appreciation is in the dialogue. Great, cleverly dense dialogue can really hit home with someone who appreciates it, and completely go over the head of those who don't.I just want to also add that there is someone here who compares to this movie to \"Twins\" despite that they've never seen Twins. Can't tell if it's a troll, hilarious if it is, they are an imbecile if it isn't lmao.This movie is called, \"Brothers.\" They aren't twins. They weren't separated at birth. They grew up being criminals, and reunited later. So besides the fact that one character has dwarfism, and the other character does not, and that they engage in a (sort of) heist, it has absolutely nothing to do with Twins, which the person who wrote that absolute idiotic nonsense would have known, had they watched the movie they were comparing this movie to.Dual moral of this story is that a comedy is a comedy and doesn't need to also include a copious amount of action to be thoroughly entertaining.

Centering on two estranged brothers, played by Josh Brolin and Peter Dinklage, the film attempts to balance heavy emotional beats with moments of humor, but the execution often feels uneven.Brolin and Dinklage deliver strong performances, managing to bring both depth and levity to their roles. Their comedic timing is solid, but the screenplay doesn't give them enough material to fully shine. The humor, though effective in some scenes, feels forced or out of place in others, disrupting the emotional flow of the narrative.Visually, the film is well-shot, with some striking moments that highlight the tension and complexity of the brothers' relationship. The soundtrack, though not particularly standout, fits the tone of the film without drawing too much attention to itself.Despite its attempts to fuse comedy with a heartfelt family drama, Brothers never fully finds its balance. While it's worth watching for the performances, especially for fans of the lead actors, the film as a whole feels underwhelming. Almost a full 6\/10 rating reflects its promise, but also its shortcomings-entertaining in parts, but not a must-see.",

Jady however is fresh out of prison and reels in Moke by informing him about their mother's health status. As Jady convinces Moke for one last hit, they are chased by Jimmy Farful who has a grudge on Jady and wants to get hold of the emeralds as well in order to please his father. The road trip has everything for the brothers to question their loyalties and how do they reconcile while making that final hit, forms rest of the story.Max Barbakow has got the casting right and everything else wrong with Brothers. This comedy has very little genuine humor in those 80 odd minutes and a bland screenplay which literally gives the actors nothing to work with. The humor ranges from meh to crass and one wonders what did these actors see in this script. To be fair, the script lacks novelty and Brendan Fraser as Jimmy Farful is the only one who makes most of what's offered to him while the rest get badly letdown by the script. The template was right there with Jady also getting to be the narrator, yet the film failed to use it's actors. Marisa Tomei's Bethesda was in the film just for Samuel's sake, otherwise her addition contributed nothing more.

And it was definitely a unique and well-written storyline that included elements of drama, crime and comedy in a good way. This was a rather nicely constructed storyline, which had some genuine entertainment value to it.The scenes with the orangutang were hilarious, and they alone actually make it worthwhile to sit down and watch the movie.The cast ensemble in the movie is pretty good, and there are some very talented performers on the cast list. With the likes of Josh Brolin, Peter Dinklage, Glenn Close, Brendan Fraser and M. Emmet Walsh, then you're in pretty good and capable company. Needless to say that the acting performances in the movie were good. There was a good chemistry on the scene between Josh Brolin and Peter Dinklage. I was especially impressed with Brendan Fraser's performance in the movie.While the movie is listed as a comedy, I will say that the comedy elements in the movie are light. But it was done quite right, because director Max Barbakow managed to incorporate comedy elements at great junctures in the narrative, which complimented the storyline and actually brought some good and genuine laughs with it.This is definitely a movie that I would recommend you to sit down and watch. I was fully and wholly entertained throughout the course of the movie.My rating of \"Brothers\" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",

        "body":"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. \"Citizen Kane\" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". \"The Godfather\" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.",

What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.",

        "body":"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10\/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox",

        "body":"THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father\/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.",

So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.My advice is that instead of just watching \"The Godfather\" and \"The Godfather: Part II\", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.",

The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.I thought \"The Godfather\" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's \"business\" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family \"business\" to the eventual \"Don.\"It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.6\/10",

        "body":"'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film.",

        "body":"My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation. All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer\/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an \"offer he can't refuse\", or \"Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes\" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.In fact it's all beautifully played.",

He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business. Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's. Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather. So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos. An all-time classic.",

Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.",

However, the face of crime is quickly changing and other syndicates are targeting Brando to eliminate him as competition. What no one figured was that youngest son Al Pacino (Oscar-nominated) may be even more ruthless and maniacal than his father. Robert Duvall and James Caan both received Oscar nominations for their roles in the wicked mix. Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda and John Cazale all do arguably the best work of their respective careers. \"The Godfather\" is epic film-making which ended up being the first true picture to deal with the topic in a non-film noir style. It is an amazing achievement which is probably the best movie produced in the 1970s (that is saying a whole lot by the way) and quite possibly the greatest motion picture of all time.

        "body":"Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director\/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving \"business\" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the \"greatest films of all time\". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, \"Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?\" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to \"11\" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of \"oscillating\" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting\/distancing, control\/lack of control, benevolence\/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) \"zoom out\" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the \"greatest film of all time\" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a \"historical family saga\" as a crime or gangster film.",

Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems \"too old or young for the part\".

The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS \"The Godfather Saga\" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing.

        "body":"The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every wayThe film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.",

Somewhere i read that Godfather was at the top of the 250 before Shawshank and that's when i decided to take a chance with Godfather. I wasn't a fan of gangster flicks so it's fair to say i never thought i'd sit through all 3 hours and minutes. What can i say? This film changed every thing about my taste in movies. After watching this i ended up as a fan of gangster movies and i went on to watch some pretty old movies and some of the longest running films. (And now i am a fan of IMDb's 250)I had a go at this movie again (for the 5th time)yesterday and compelled to write a review here.I'm not gonna say anything new here after all these 1687 reviews but anyone reading this i guess you probably watched the movie and inspired enough to read the reviews here. If that so give me a thumps up! In my opinion The Greatest Gangster Film ever. And Arguably the greatest movie of all time. 10 out of 10.",

It seemed like it was also going to tell us the story of Michael's sons, grandsons, great grandsons,  great great grandsons, and well.... it just seemed endless. ENDLESS. I wondered why IMDb users praise it so much if every single person that I know despises this movie. It's beyond dull. At the end, somehow Michael got rid of ALL of his enemies, in 2 minutes? Just that simple? He should have made that before, and he would have kept me from suffering this dreck. After watching this, I never want to watch one of those called \"classics\" (like Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Schindler´s list, Gone with the Wind, etc.) because it seems to ba a rule that a movie can´t be artistic and entertaining. Few movies combine those things. Those are the true classics. One example? Pulp Fiction. That movie is perfect in every possible way.I'll rate this movie a 3. I don't give it a one just because Marlon Brando was great. By the way, Al Pacino sucked in this movie. He couldn't have been more inexpressive.",

        "body":"The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original \"Movie Brats\" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!! The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures) The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter. Gosh this movie is awesome and fantastic! I love it to death!!!!!10\/10 Grade: Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Paramount Pictures Starring: Marlon Brando,Al Pacino,James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall,Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte,Diane Keaton Director: Francis Ford Coppola Producer: Albert S.

        "body":"Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is \"The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces\" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the \"Corleone Family Mafia\". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role\/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.I highly recommend this movie.",

        "body":"One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.\nFor starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.\nWhat's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred \"Goodfellas\". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.8\/10",

        "body":"Immortal for its contribution to cinema & one of the prime examples of filmmaking art, The Godfather is a remarkable inside-out look at the life of a mafia family that also paints an astounding portrait of organised crime. Scoring full marks in all aspects of filmmaking, be it direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography, editing or music, this crime drama immerses viewers into its world from the very beginning and narrates its story with such strong magnetic grip for the next three hours that it's impossible to not be impressed & amazed by it. Even after so many viewings, there is nothing to complain about this classic, there is no weakness to exploit and with each view, the respect for this motion picture masterpiece only gets higher.Based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family, a respectable & powerful family having major underworld influences which are overseen by Don Vito Corleone, who is termed as Godfather by his peers as a token of respect. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter the drug business, a series of events are set in motion which results in an assassination attempt on the Don, increasing rivalries among the mafia families, and paves way for Don's youngest son to rise & take up his father's job in order to protect his family and to settle all disputes. The film revolves around Michael Corleone (Don's youngest son) and even the main plot of the story is the evolution of Michael from a doe-eyed outsider, who didn't want to get into the family business, into a ruthless boss later in the story.The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is no short of amazement. The way he filmed most of the scenes from the very beginning to the end, the casting decisions he made, the chosen locations for shooting, the remarkable screenplay & memorable quotes co-written with Mario Puzo and the overall style of narration & look of the film, it's all brilliantly done. Cinematography is carried out beautifully and the decision to shoot in Technicolor print pays off enormously well for it provided this film a vintage look that wonderfully matched the timeline it represented and also added an artistic flair to the whole medium. Editing is very precisely done with each character getting enough time on-screen without robbing its expertly controlled pace. Nino Rota's score opens the film with a sad, almost funeral-like theme music, and boasts tracks which sound very unusual for a crime drama but then it also fits the film's ambiance remarkably well. The overall work by the entire technical crew is as much responsible for this film's success as the direction, writing & performances.As far as performances go, The Godfather features a cast of incredibly gifted actors in Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri & many more, and every one of them is in top-notch form. Marlon Brando makes Don Corleone truly his own, giving his character a set of unique look & traits and delivers, possibly, the greatest performance of all time which also immortalised the character of Don Corleone in cinema forever and permanently engraved Brando's status as one of world's finest actors. Al Pacino also makes his mark on the big stage and delivers the next great performance as Michael Corleone, plus his rise to power from a reluctant outsider into a ruthless mafia boss remains one of the most spectacular character arcs ever exhibited on film canvas. James Caan stars as Sonny Corleone, Don's hot-headed eldest son, and I don't recall Caan delivering any other performance of this calibre and same goes for Richard S. Castellano who plays Clemenza, a caporegime for the Corleone family. Other notable works include Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Abe Vigoda as Tessio & Al Lettieri as Virgil Sollozzo. All in all, there are no complains in this department either.Telling a tale that spans ten years of the Corleone family in three hours, while also reflecting the world of organised crime with immense character depth & complexity unlike anything before it, and ingeniously blending it with impressive direction, sturdy writing, impeccable performances, striking quotes, innovative storytelling & a mesmerizing score, The Godfather is an exceptionally well-made motion picture and certainly the one with the best cast. Ever since its release, it has become the benchmark by which all the great masterpieces are measured and its influence on cinema, especially gangster genre, is unprecedented. On an overall scale, The Godfather is universally accepted as one of world cinema's finest films, arguably the greatest ever, and the performances by Marlon Brando & Al Pacino alone are the stuff of legends. Plus, this films also marks a significant moment in cinema, in my opinion, in which the baton was passed from Marlon Brando, the finest actor of his generation, to Al Pacino who later became the finest actor of the subsequent era. The film doesn't need my recommendation because it's a must watch for every cinema lover. There are very few movies which are unanimously hailed as a great one from critics, filmmakers & viewers all around the world and The Godfather is unquestionably one of those classics and, in my opinion, the only one that deserves the top spot. A cinematic treasure you should neither refuse nor ignore, The Godfather is genre filmmaking at its most perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline & pure. One hundred percent recommended.",

Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion.

        "body":"With 2022's 'X' and 'Pearl,' Ti West created two extremely entertaining, wickedly clever horror comedies, honouring two specific types of films. 'X' is a homage to- and pastiche of- 1970's grindhouse tropes, most obviously 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' while 'Pearl' is a like a warped, 1950's Technicolour melodrama, like the cinematic child of Walt Disney and Dario Argento. Both films are prime examples of satire, successfully implementing elements of the object they are satirising without becoming that object themselves.With 'MaXXXine,' the newest addition to the 'X' franchise, West aims to send-up giallo and exploitation films of the late 70's, as well as the video nasties of the 1980's and Hollywood set slashers in general. Taking place in 1985, six years after the events of the original, the film follows Maxine Minx, who is trying to make a go of it in the pictures. After landing her big break, she is blackmailed by someone threatening to reveal her participation in the 1979 massacre. Meanwhile, the Nightstalker roams the streets, and Maxine's friends are dropping like flies. Will Maxine finally become a star, or be forced to live a life she doesn't deserve?Enjoyable though narratively uneven, visually, 'MaXXXine' dazzles, recreating the neon-soaked decadence of mid-1980's Los Angeles. However, beneath its glossy surface lies a narrative that lacks the bite, wit and unpredictability of its predecessors. Although entertaining, at times the film threatens to become that which it is satirising- a schlocky Hollywood slasher. West incorporates many familiar elements of 80's movies- bickering cops, an over-the-top villain, a seedy P. I., shootouts- but these seem more like cliches than effective satire, as their inclusion lacks any kind of fresh spin or commentary.In 'X' and 'Pearl,' every detail was meticulously calculated, purposefully included to heighten the emotion of any given scene. Here, it feels as if West tossed in tropes just for kicks, leaving one wondering about their purpose. Effective satire dances on the edge, teasing its subjects without falling into their traps; 'MaXXXine' wobbles- sometimes clever, other times clumsy. Perhaps West's intention was to blur the line between homage and parody. But in doing so, he risks losing the very essence that made his earlier films shine.Additionally, supporting characters are underwritten, lacking depth or personality. There are no reasons to care for any of them, as the majority aren't on screen for long enough to leave any kind of impact. Those that are start off as cliches- a no-nonsense director, a lascivious Southerner, two cardboard cut out cops- and then proceed not to change. Considering West's brilliant characterisation in previous films, it's rather disappointing.As is the exceedingly underwhelming final act, which boils down to a forgettable gunfight. Moreover, the identity of the villain will only come as a surprise to someone who has never seen a film before. Conversely, the character of Maxine Minx is still compelling; her determination, resilience and unwavering pursuit of stardom keeps one engaged. She's an unstoppable force, refusing to fade into the shadows, that one cannot help but root for.Furthermore, West and cinematographer Eliot Rockett do sterling work, emphasising the seediness of the City of Angels, where devils prowl down grimy alleyways. Moreover, they cleverly weave video aesthetics into the fabric of the film itself. Grain dances across the screen, a nod to VHS tapes and late-night cable channels, while de-focused shots blur the line between reality and fantasy, hinting at Maxine's hidden past. It's a visual language that speaks to those who remember tracking lines and rewinding cassettes, compounding the film's heady atmosphere.In addition, Jason Kisvarday's detailed production design is successful at immersing the viewer in the ostentatious 1980's, where everything was bigger and brighter than before or after. Mari-An Ceo's costume design, alongside Kelsi Ephraim's set decoration, contributes to this immersive effect, while Tyler Bates' evocative, synthesised score wouldn't feel out of place in an 80's Brian De Palma or J. Lee Thompson vehicle, and the soundtrack- making great use of tracks from the likes of ZZ Top and Kim Carnes- is stirring.Mia Goth's commanding central performance as Maxine is where the film's greatest strength lies. As in her two previous collaborations with West, her intrepid character shows through clearly. Goth is not afraid to go all out and risk being called over-the-top. Surely, after all, with material like this, she's meant to be grandiose? Even in it's weakest moments, Goth keeps 'MaXXXine' from becoming uninteresting; remaining a pivotal figure in modern horror cinema.Opposite her, Kevin Bacon is excellent as the aforementioned sleazy, Southern P. I., making a one-note character arguably the most entertaining in the picture. Elizabeth Debicki does assured work as the director who gives Maxine her big break, though the role doesn't give her much to play with. Giancarlo Esposito is clearly having a ball in the all-too small part of Maxine's agent, while Michelle Monaghan and Bobby Cannavale are all but wasted as the cops; getting nothing to do but doing it well.Ti West's 'MaXXXine' is an entertaining comic-horror, but lies in the shadow of its predecessors, which were considerably more cohesive, original and accomplished. Despite striking visuals and a stirring score, its narrative underwhelms, teetering between clever and clunky. Although Mia Goth and her supporting cast- most notably Kevin Bacon- do strong work, unfortunately 'MaXXXine' falls short of exxxcellent.",

But the character deserved a better finale. The stakes didn't feel high enough. I'm a fan of Kevin Bacon, but his character wasn't threatening at all. He was more comical (in an annoying way) and given way too much screen time.The kills were ok. The detectives were one dimensional characters... and the finale was anti-climactic. I would've liked to have seen something more with a Tarantino vibe.The best part of the movie (aside from Mia) was the use of 80s music and nostalgia. But I can't really attribute that to the filmmakers.Not a bad movie by any means. All of the elements were there. But the final product just wasn't as dynamic as it could've been.",

In it, Maxine Minx gets a role in a legitimate film called \"The Puritan 2\" (a sequel to \"The Puritan\") and is anxious to finally become a real star. However, her past from the events of \"X\" start to catch up to her when a detective (who is working for a mysterious man) finds her, and among the backdrop of the \"Night Stalker\" slayings in Los Angeles, people around Maxine are starting to die...\"MaXXXine\" is far the weakest of the three \"X\" films. That's not to say it's bad, but it doesn't have the real horror and novelty of \"X\" and the \"can't look away\" suspense of \"Pearl.\" The person behind everything is pretty obvious, and there are really many threats that are simply too quickly and easily resolved, so much of the suspense is limited. Goth is great, as always, but there really isn't anybody else in the cast that really stands out. And there is a real lack of actual \"horror\" in this movie. \"X\" was a great, flat out horror movie. \"Pearl\" was more horrifying, perhaps, as opposed to pure \"horror.\" But I'm not sure \"MaXXXine\" really qualifies as a \"horror movie\" at all. And the ending... meh.I have no hesitation recommending \"MaXXXine\" -- the story is interesting, Ti West is a wonderful filmmaker, Maxine Minx is a great character, and Mia Goth is great in the role. But as is the case in more trilogies, the first is clearly the best and each one decreases in quality.",

This looks like it was shot on actual film. It is grainy, vibrant, colorful, lots of contrast, the camera work was great. I just love when a film looks like a film and not an amazon ad.

        "body":"This audacious conclusion to Ti West's \"X\" trilogy follows that film's final girl, Maxine Minx, an aspiring actress who, several years after surviving a mass murder, is attempting to forge a mainstream acting career in Hollywood. Unfortunately, someone has other plans for her.While it may not plumb the emotional depths that something like \"Pearl\" did (exquisitely and at times devastatingly, I thought), and although it is not as slasher-heavy as \"X\", \"MaXXXine\" takes this trilogy of films to the most popcorny of popcorny heights--and I mean that in the best way possible.\"MaXXXine\" is downright fun--a typical murder mystery with Italian giallo elements and an intoxicating mid-'80s Los Angeles setting that hits the right notes of video glam and the ugliness lurking underneath. There are noticeable echoes of films like \"Vice Squad\" (1982), \"Hollywood Boulevard\" (1976), and \"Hardcore' (1979), but the film it perhaps most reminded me of was 1984's exploitation classic \"Angel\", which stars Donna Wilkes as a prostitute trying to evade a serial killer on Hollywood Boulevard. \"MaXXXine\" owes more to this Hollywood sub-genre of exploitation than it does any slasher film. Where \"X\" was West's love letter to southern horror a la Tobe Hooper, and where \"Pearl\" was his homage to the 1950s Technicolor epics, \"MaXXXine\" is really a grandiose bow to the numerous Hollywood-set exploitation films of the late '70s and '80s.Mia Goth reprises her role of Maxine here and is as strong as ever, creating a heroine who is likable despite having her own moral flaws. Like Hollywood itself, Maxine is really a cipher for the spirit of the town and the industry--she is all about ambition and all about surfaces, her rocky past be damned. There is a large host of characters circling around her here, with a number of older, highly recognizable stars (Kevin Bacon, Giancarlo Esposito, Michelle Monaghan, Bobby Cannavale) along with a younger cast of Goth's peers (Elizabeth Debicki, Halsey, Moses Sumney), and the chemistry among everyone works nicely.My one minor gripe with the film is the final act, which boasts a somewhat predictable reveal and a finale that almost stretches itself too thin for its own good. Despite this, \"MaXXXine\" remains irresistibly fun and witty, which alone makes it worthwhile. Fans of the above-mentioned Hollywood exploitation films will especially enjoy it. She's a star, all right, if only in her own movie. 8\/10.",

But its more than that...these center around the struggle to become famous (or infamous) but wrapped up as a murder\/mystery\/serial killer slasher, splattered with a healthy dose of blood, violence, and some super squeamish momentsa lot of people say \"Pearl\" is their favorite in this series but i found that one a bit annoying (for lack of a better way to describe it, although it was the most stylish and different). MaXXXine is a little more standard in terms of the story telling and execution and i was mostly into it.The first 2 acts were pretty engaging with a good amount of WTF graphic violence and gore but i felt like the third act dragged at some points and then just kinda fizzled out once the twist dropped.Overall, i did like this and would reco but only to those who are already familiar with the two movies preceding it. Yes, you could watch this as a standalone but many of the references and the general story would be lost if youre not already aware of Maxine's journey.

Mia Goth again plays the main character, now a Porn Star who wants to go 'legit' by doing a horror film with the hopes that it will make her a real star.West (who also wrote) does a decent job evoking the era. He ups the stakes by setting it against the back drop of the Night Stalker case and the decade's Satanic Panic. The Los Angeles locations are authentic including scenes at Universal and Warner Brothers studios. The supporting cast includes Kevin Bacon as a sort of Southern fried Jake Gittes, Elizabeth Debicki as an up and coming film director who aspires to being an artist with a capital \"A\", Giancarlo Esposito as a very hands on Agent, and Michelle Monaghan and Bobby Cannavale as detectives. They all are good, with Bacon and Cannavale having the juiciest roles. A couple of the lines about Hollywood are amusing throwaways. Still, without Goth, none of it works. She's clearly channeled this character, and you sense it on screen.On the downside, West insists on including incredibly graphic violence in close-up that once would have earned it an NC-17 (or, at least a trip back to the MPAA). Sure, it's a \"horror film\", but it feels over the top even in that context. West's experiments in this trilogy over three distinct time periods is more interesting in concept and design than results. MAXXXINE intentionally looks like some modern update on 80s revenge pictures from the likes of Cannon and New World. West seems to think that aping those films but with a \"smart\" 21st century perspective is enough; But, for all of Goth's fine work (and, to be fair, West's technical skill) it can't help but feel like an empty exercise. For all its attitude it still ends up being just a grindhouse exploitation movie itself. There aren't any true insights nor commentary, just a juiced up modern version of the same old. West has talent (and, for now, Goth), but, his retro obsession is becoming a dead end.",

Maxine's fight for stardom takes center stage, with the ever-present threat of her past bubbling to the surface.

It's rare to find a movie that successfully satires the responses to itself.This movie is a fantasy. The things that you see on the screen are a bit over the top, \"style over substance\" and all that, because it's not reality, it's the fantasy of the main character, perhaps of all of the characters. Things may be, but probably are not, \"real\".It's also a pretty well thought out meta satire, as it involves an actual actress playing a porn star wanting to become a classic film star in a horror movie that mirrors the events in the film and her personal life. Everybody in Hollywood wants to be an actor, the beast swallows or spits out what it may, so all of the people in the film are characters and all of the places in the film are stages. Instead of watching what Maxine does, listen to what Bender says. That's the spirit of the film and the rest is just a matte painting, everything's a stage.Bottom line: a noir satire of Hollywood, mixing crime, horror and , of course, the movie industry to great effect.

        "body":"Stranger Things for adults, or tons of 80's paraphernalia without any substance whatsoever. Actually, there's not much of an adult content either - literal or metaphorical. I can not see this as anything but a parody, really, so anyone who takes horror seriously should probably stay away. It's like Ti West hates the genre, the film industry and the 80's as a whole and wants to show us just how bad it was. Emblematic is the scene where the Hollywood Sign is shown from behind like a tin shell with a hollow sound. He has a point, of course, but why embarrass himself while making it? Because one can produce a better parody, you know. Pearl, for example, also borrowed its aesthetics and tropes from a previous cinematic era, but it worked like it probably never worked back in the day and despite it was a cliche, it was gripping; it had meaning. I guess, I expected something similar and imagined that the catchy phrase I WILL NOT ACCEPT A LIFE I DO NOT DESERVE would sound powerful and tragic. Well, I shouldn't have.",

        "body":"MaXXXine is a solid ending to a great trilogy. Mia Goth delivers a star performance as Maxine just as she did in the other two films. I love the 80s feel in this movie. From the music, to the wardrobe, to the scenery, they really did a great job in that department. I enjoyed the movie but I do have a few complaints about it. It needed a little more horror in it, it felt more like it belongs in the thriller genre rather than horror. The characters Tabby (Halsey) and Molly (Lily Collins) needed more screen time, their characters kind of felt wasted to be honest. Also, some of the kills are off screen which I'm not a fan of. Don't let that deter you from seeing this though, MaXXXine is a solid final entry in the X trilogy.",

        "body":"This third feature started with two prior films with the first as an unique, 70s era-related film, eroding exploitation cinema as well as porn tropes: X (2022) directed by Ti West. It's original storytelling utilized Goth as two characters: Pearl and Maxine. It seemed to \"borrow\" a lot of aesthetics from1973's Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Interestingly enough, Goth had just appeared in the 1978 Suspiria (2018) remake where an actor played two roles as well. Then came in the same year, a sequel - a surreal story set in a technocolored-like 50s: Pearl (2022) introducing an obsession of celebrity culture or being a \"star\".Again, Goth in another period piece where violence and gore played a huge role (giving Goth the time evolve her acting talent). Now the timeline jumps Goth forward into 80s with the supposed ending of West's trilogy.With Maxxxine, it continues the X storyline, following it's survivor in the L. A. porn scene providing insight on Maxine's early childhood past. This entry loses its what had made it interesting - exploring the pop cultural nostalgia of different eras but met with violence.This film seemed to be more concerned with 80s antics: the era's fashion, pop music, etc. Although Goth acting is center placed but get weakens within the storyline.Yes, there's finally closure, but Maxxxine as a third part that is at a crossroads. There's talk that West wants to continue, but where can it go?This film's portrayal of its characters felt outsourced, exhausted and the excitement of 80s culture is the star. That has laid Pearl\/Maxine storyline to rest with lots of Easter eggs within the film (fanatics can delve in its investigation).In the end, this film to encapsulated Maxine (and trying to bring a Pearl experience through traumatic memory). This happened within minutes in a reference that has no weight.It felt really forced since the film's direction was centered on Maxine's childhood that never \"really\" crosses Pearl's story. Memorable screen moments are provided, appropriately by 80s iconic actor: Kevin Bacon!",

The movie felt really short and wasn't scary at all, the twist of who the killer was, was pretty dumb in my opinion. Overall, not terrible but could've been better.

        "body":"This was a film that I was excited to see. My wife, Jaime, and I have gone to the theater for all the movies in the series. Now when X and Pearl came out, our child wasn't born yet. We were able to catch this on opening Friday together in the theater. I avoided spoilers and what I heard ahead of seeing this was positive. I've also now given this a second watch to see where I sat with it for my end of year list.Synopsis: in 1980s Hollywood, adult film star and aspiring actor Maxine Minx (Mia Goth) finally gets her big break. But as a mysterious killer stalks the rising stars of Hollywood, a trail of blood threatens to reveal her sinister past.We start this off by seeing a black and white film. It is a home movie of our lead, Maxine, when she was a girl. She is portrayed by Charley Rowan McCain. Her father is filming her and she aspires to be like him, taking an important role in the church. Something else of note, there is a mantra that he's instilled. She is going to get the life that she deserves.This then shifts to the present, which is 1985 and Hollywood, California. Maxine comes to an audition for a horror movie. In attendance is Elaine (Deborah Geffner), who is a casting director, a producer and the director, Elizabeth Bender (Elizabeth Debicki). This is a sequel to Elizabeth's earlier film, The Puritan. There are protestors outside of the studio, putting pressure on them.Maxine is a busy woman making it in Los Angeles. She leaves the audition and goes to the location where she makes porn. She has made a name for herself and she's hoping that will help her get into the mainstream. It is there that she talks to another performer, Amber James (Chloe Farnworth). She invites Maxine to a party in the hills, but our lead must work that night in a peepshow. It is at this gig we meet another friend, Tabby Martin (Halsey). She also invites Maxine to a party, to which she declines.There is good news here though. She didn't land one part that she auditioned for on a television series, because of her work in the adult industry and not having enough mainstream work. This annoys her, because like with all experience, how do you get it if no one takes a chance? She did land the role in the horror film. She is excited to share this with her friend, Leon (Moses Sumney), who works at a video store and is a film buff.Like the synopsis says, there is a killer targeting rising stars in Hollywood. It is believed that it is the 'Night Stalker', Richard Ramirez. We see this black gloved killer watching Maxine in a peep show room and they might also be the one throwing the party in the hills. The deaths are people close to Maxine, which leads detectives to her to ask questions. They are Williams (Michelle Monaghan) and Torres (Bobby Cannavale). There is also a private investigator who found her, John Labat (Kevin Bacon). These all complicate her life which could turn her focus needed for Elizabeth's horror film away.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start then is that this is an interesting trilogy. Each film is different from the last. X was a slasher film set in the late 70s. Pearl is a character study of why that character became how she did in the early 1920s and then this one here feels like a giallo with slasher elements. I commend Ti West for bringing these types of films together to tell this story.Now that I have that out of the way, let me get into this one and I want to start with our lead, Maxine. What is interesting is that the version of her we got in X isn't the woman that she is here. That ordeal changed her. We see that even from being a girl from the cold open, she's been determined to be a star. She's made a name for herself in the adult industry and has turned her sights on mainstream fame with The Puritan 2. Elizabeth can see her talents. She recommends that whatever is holding her back and haunting her, she needs to take care of it or it will bring her down. That forms the framework of the story for this character and I thought this movie does well in the character arch. We already know that Maxine is a fighter, but she still needs to grow to survive. Goth is great here and one of her best performances in my opinion.Let's then discuss more of the story. An aspect that I love is this being a love letter to films of the past. We are seeing that underbelly of LA where Maxine works in porn and other adult things. There is gialli here with our killer wearing black gloves and stalking her. There is sleaze that comes with it. I love framing this with the 'Night Stalker', which is a true case. Sticking with the Italian mystery references, Maxine is approached by the two detectives who want her help. She does her own investigation. You could even consider this as a neo-noir as well, since there's a private detective, John, who is working for our killer. My only gripe is that I knew who the killer was early on. I do think more could have been done there. The reveal isn't bad though because if you've seen the other films, it is the only thing that makes sense. More care could have been done though to weave it in.Before moving away from the story, I do love that this incorporates other things from the past as well. There are news stories about the 'Satanic Panic' craze. We see people outside of the studio protesting The Puritan 2. Elizabeth makes a great comment about how the heads didn't want Maxine cast due to her being in porn. The director thought she could nail the role and it is ironic that being their concern, when the movie is about possession and demons. I thought it was also strategic in Elizabeth being British, because she references the 'video nasties'. That was a good touch. This would make an interesting double feature with Censor, which takes place over there in a similar era. These were little touches that as a cinephile and horror fan, fit into the true history.That should be enough for the story so then over to the acting. I've already said how great Goth was. She owns this role. In support of her, I liked Debicki as the director. She is helping her grow, which is needed for the story. My other favorite character was played by Sumney. Jaime whispered to me about how if I was in this world, which would be me. He's a film fan who works at a video store, which was a job I've previously held. Bacon plays an odd character and it worked well. I'll credit Monaghan and Cannavale as the detectives. Farnworth and Halsey were solid as was Simon Prast. I love the cameos by Giancarlo Esposito, Larry Fessenden and Lily Collins. The acting here was good to push Maxine where she ends up.All that is left is filmmaking. Something that I read before writing this was that they used film, cameras and techniques that were from the era. It is the care like that which brings charm to this. The cinematography is great. The framing was as well. They do well to capture that giallo vibe needed. I'd say that the effects were great here. They also fit that subgenre with how visceral and realistic they looked. I appreciate that. I'd say that this is paced well, tells a good story, even though I guessed the killer a bit too early on. Other than that, I love the song selections for the soundtrack. It was spot on for what was needed.Now to stay in this vein, I noticed and figured things out with a second watch. Maxine steps over a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. This is one belonging to Theda Bara. She was a silent film actor who was a sex symbol for her time. She also inspired tempter roles in movies that would follow. That's great to include and is lost on most people with one viewing, including me. There is also good writing here with things that are said, then called back to. One would be with Labat and a reference to his religious stance. The duality as well of people believing that Hollywood as satanists. This is something that is still believed by the fringe today. There is more care here than I originally realized.In conclusion, I loved this movie. This is such an interesting trilogy. Each film is different, but it works in the framework that each one needs. Goth is great here. She owns this character. The rest of the cast is good at pushing her to where she ends up. I like how this was made, from the cinematography, soundtrack to the effects. This being a love letter to gialli, cinema of the past and the horror genre is great. I can see people not clicking with this one, but it worked for me. I'm glad that I rewatched this as it definitely solidified that even if I think this could be the weakest of the three, it is still a great film.My Rating: 9 out of 10.",

        "body":"Fun '80s horror throwback, setting yourself apart from Xand Pearl, while also being an intriguing, presumably last chapter in the trilogy. Mia Goth is a badass, Kevin Bacon oozes sleaze and has a great final scene, and Giancarlo Esposito creates an unpredictably cool character. All the acting was good, including Bobby Cannavale and Michelle Monaghan as LAPD detectives.The film is an ode to the '80s, '80s horror, and Hollywood, in general. It's nowhere near Mulholland Drive -- the film, not the road -- but it isn't trying to be, although it would make a fun double feature. It could easily be a double feature with Body Double, as well, and has a lot in common with that one. However, it could be paired just as easily with Sunset Boulevard, and in paying homage to classic Hollywood and also bookings itself in very cool ways with Bette Davis references, especially considering how apt they are when it comes to Maxine's character.The film isn't as propulsive or fascinating as X or, especially, Pearl, which I think is one of the top five horror films this century. But Maxxxine seems also purposely not meant to be that way, which makes sense considering each film has been developed with intentions in mind when it comes to paying homage to the horror genre. Speaking to that, I really enjoyed the influence of Psycho found, in different ways, in Pearl and now Maxxxine.There is a little bit too much '80s reference, but it is always fun to see, nevertheless. I also like the way it uses The Night Stalker in a couple different ways throughout the film's storyline.Interestingly enough, the first 10 minutes of the film or so sets it up to be really raunchy, but then the rest of the film doesn't turn out necessarily that way. A lot of the gore is done in a way that's not exactly horrific but more gruesome and amusing, especially for those that have watched a bunch of '80s horror. And it's also interesting the way that, as the film progresses, it taps into '80s action films, as well.Overall, a fun time at the theater, starring some great actors, well-written and directed, while not, perhaps, as fun as X or as groundbreaking as Pearl, it's still a very solid horror film.",

        "body":"\"MaXXXine\" is the third installment in a distinctive horror trilogy that began with 2022's \"X,\" a gritty slasher film that took audiences by surprise with its unabashed and unapologetic depictions of - and there's not a more polite way to say this - sex and violence. \"X\" related to people's base instincts by not shying away from scenes that titillated and disgusted; for every sequence of nudity and sexual deviance, there was an equally graphic scene of gory violence. The result was a full-on crowd-pleaser that, surprisingly, boasted excellent artistic direction from director Ti West. With a \"slow and steady wins the race\" approach, \"X\" took its time developing its characters while still being entertaining and fun, even before the horror elements began, largely due to the film's sexy and provocative nature, which kept audiences engaged and intrigued throughout the buildup. And yes, the star power of Mia Goth and Jenna Ortega certainly helped keep my eyes glued to the screen. Enter \"MaXXXine.\" Taking a polar opposite approach in both style and substance, \"MaXXXine\" appears to shy away from being overly sexual and overly violent. This is a curious choice, given that the success of \"X\" was largely due to its unabashed embrace of both sex and violence. The result is a middling, mediocre movie that appears to be disinterested in both entertaining and telling an intriguing story.I was excited for \"MaXXXine,\" so excited, in fact, that I decided to go see an early access showing before its official release date. I dragged two of my friends along with me, and all three of us indulged in some adult beverages, ready and willing to make the most out of our viewing experience. Unfortunately, we got less than we bargained for, as \"MaXXXine\" is a film that seeks to subvert audience expectations in all the wrong ways. Director Ti West indulged viewers with \"X,\" giving audiences exactly what they wanted and expected; with \"MaXXXine,\" West seemingly gives a middle finger to his audience, as the film contains little nudity, barely any violence, and perhaps worst of all, zero horror.I'm not entirely sure what West aimed to achieve with \"MaXXXine.\" The film isn't scary enough to be classified as horror, isn't thrilling enough to be a thriller, and isn't engaging enough to be entertaining; my friends and I sat in a packed theater, struggling to stay awake as the film plodded along from scene to scene. But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. What is the story \"MaXXXine\" tries to tell? Not a very interesting one. Following the titular Maxine as she navigates Hollywood in her quest for stardom, \"MaXXXine\" is primarily a drama with some mystery elements woven in - the central question revolving around the identity of the killer targeting Maxine's co-stars. So, I guess you could call this film a murder mystery, albeit one that is immediately predictable.There are no thrills or chills here - the film seems to want to avoid both being overtly sexual and overtly violent, except for a few shots of gore here and there. And if you're going to see this movie because you think it's a horror film, get that idea out of your head right now because \"MaXXXine\" doesn't seek to scare; there is one sequence that I found particularly disturbing - other than that, the movie has nary a jump scare to frighten its viewers. So, what do you get? Instead of the expected slasher, \"MaXXXine\" offers a light noir adventure that primarily follows a private detective stalking Maxine across Hollywood while the so-called Nightstalker hunts his own victims. And while this might sound exciting, it's portrayed in the most simplistic and stripped-down manner, as if West intentionally wanted to deprive his audience of any hint of excitement.Additionally, Mia Goth barely gets any time to shine, even though she is in virtually every scene of the film. Where \"X\" and its prequel, \"Pearl,\" gave Mia plenty of scene-stealing moments, \"MaXXXine\" at once tells a story revolving around that central character while simultaneously being disinterested in giving said character any real time to stand out from the crowd. Because of that, the film's side characters prove to be the standouts, with Kevin Bacon, Giancarlo Esposito, and Halsey stealing the show. And like I mentioned before, the overall plot of the movie is so predictable that you'll be begging West to not go the route you think he's going - and surprise! - he goes the route you think he's going, leading to an underwhelming climax and a downright questionable final shot that took the wind out of myself and the entire audience I saw this with.Overall, \"MaXXXine\" is a disappointment, especially when compared to the stellar previous two films in this trilogy. In a surprising turn, West takes a conservative approach, noticeably pulling back from the raw sexuality, graphic violence, and sheer entertainment value that characterized the earlier films. This results in a remarkably subdued narrative that lacks the edge and intensity fans have come to expect. While it attempts to explore new thematic territory, the film's reluctance to fully embrace its predecessors' bold style ultimately diminishes its impact and leaves viewers yearning for the provocative allure that defined the series.",

        "body":"Mia Goth kills it again (literally) in Ti West's Maxxxine, third part of what could be described as his nostalgic horror porn trilogy, a blissfully lurid chapter of self referential horror that tackles showmanship, stardom and the need to make a name for oneself. Goth's Maxine feels this need deeply as she makes her way from the brutal 1970's farmhouse events of the first film into sleazy, fabulous 1980's Los Angeles where she works part time as a stripper, always looking for that big break. Someone else is out there looking for her though, a vicious killer who strikes close to home and litters the streets in her vicinity with bodies. This is my favourite film of the trilogy and not just for the obvious 80's nostalgia factor (which I am an abject sucker for) although admittedly that is part of it. The themes here and references to 80's horror in Hollywood are studious, charming and thought provoking as they mirror Maxine's bloody rise to stardom, the scrip arc is handled the best so far in this story. Also the cast is large, loud and just having so much fun. Standouts include Elizabeth Debicki as a no-nonsense horror filmmaker out to make a name for herself as well, Sophie Thatcher in a quick cameo as an expert makeup\/FX artist, Giancarlo Esposito as Maxine's ruthless agent and Kevin Bacon in utter sleaze mode as a spectacularly grimy private investigator. Goth owns the character fiercely as Maxine emerges from her 1970's chrysalis into the 80's as a badass, beautiful woman who knows what she wants and will do anything to get it, including lots of murder.

Director Ti West has a fantastic ability to capture the look and feel of movies from different eras and it's a flawless take on the style of an actual 80s movie. This looks like it could've come out in the early to mid-80s (except for a few moments where you can tell they used CGI to make it more period-appropriate). Also, I loved the music and the performances. Mia Goth is magnificent and continues to show why she's a star. Kevin Bacon chews up the scenery wherever he's on screen and I love that for him. There are some terrific moments of practical effects in this. West makes you wait for them. However, when they happen, they're superb, fierce, and brutal. The first third of the film is great. The part where the titular character walks out after the audition was stellar. At the 20-minute mark, I was certain that this was going to be my favorite of the trilogy. Sadly, by the end, I felt like it kinda prattled for 60% of the film then shoved a finale and called it a day. Ngl, there was wasted potential with this one. It kept setting up things with little to no payoff. Clearly, this was inspired by directors like Brian De Palma, Martin Scorsese, and a host of others except the substance doesn't quite live up to the style. The biggest issue is that there is barely a plot to drive the film. It feels jumbled and some moments don't add up. You don't know if you're watching a revenge flick, slasher film, vigilante movie, or neo-noir. It's sort of an aimless mishmash of great elements. It was hard to get invested in what was happening as I was trying to figure out what it was to be. I just waiting for the main character to become something - the villain, the hero, or the anti-hero - but she just kinda is. This isn't about her killing to get ahead in the business, killing to save her friends, or trying to survive a killer who's after her except it's also all of those things in an odd way. Also, there are more logic holes in this film than the other two. I wanted to love this film so bad. Maybe my expectations were too high but I didn't love the movie, unfortunately. With that being said, I still like it even if it was a bit disappointing. It's an enjoyable and a fun time.",

        "body":"While definitely the weakest of the X trilogy for me I still rather enjoyed Maxine's tale to its conclusion. She came from nothing and was a survivor that used sheer willpower and relentless hard work to attain her end goal. And Mia Goth's performance, while not nearly as impactful as the last two films, especially in Pearl, it was still solid nevertheless. I also enjoyed whoever was in charge of the soundtrack as well, pumping out the rock and metal hits including nods to the rock gods Judas Pries and even including one of their songs A Prisoner of Your Eyes, an underrated classic. What I didn't like though about Maxxxine vs the other two films lied in its pacing and disjointed nature compared to the look and feel of the last two movies. The last two movies were more of the horror and thriller nature, with suspenseful moments and sheer disturbing ones. Maxxxine was felt more like a Scooby Doo episode trying to figure out who the stalker\/killer was and when the big reveal happened if just turned out to be old man Crabtree who ran the local county amusement park. I mean it wasn't even that big of a twist too. Anyone with half a brain could have figured out who the killer was before the first act wrapped. I just feel like this movie would have fared much better if the writing was a bit more polished to reach a more fulfilling conclusion than well, Maxxxine made it to the big leagues after swatting a pesky fly who was buzzing around her for the better part of 100 minutes. Overall it was a fair, yet lukewarm ending to what was actually a pretty crazy first two part trilogy and if I had to pick a favorite of the three films, it would definitely not be Maxxxine. No, that award for me goes to Pearl.",

And then the third act: the reveal is weird and feels out of place and just a let down for all the buildup leading to it... the final showdown is messy and also feels rushed and just too simplistic, things happen off camera and you just gotta accept it like \"ok, *that* went down, I guess, don't know how, didn't see any details\".So while the film keeps you somewhat entertained, or at least a bit intrigued, it feels like you are there always expecting \"something\" to happen and it very rarely does, it always feels disappointing and undeserving of the previous build up.I'm a sucker for recreating and trying to revive the aura of horror movies of past decades, specially 70s and even more specially the 80s. So I was very excited to relive the cliches, the style, the atmosphere, but the plot is still the most important part and it just felt a bit vague and empty here.They had a promising story and a great backdrop.

        "body":"The conclusion of the trilogy that Ti West began in 2022 as an exploration of exploitation and horror cinema, with references to iconic directors such as Hitchcock and De Palma. Set in 1985, the film follows the character of Mia Goth as she navigates the seediest parts of Hollywood and is threatened by a serial killer. The film critiques the cultural hypocrisy of the decade by reconciling puritanism with a fascination for violence, while paying homage to the sexploitation thrillers that could be found in video stores all over the country. Despite problems with character development and an anticlimactic ending, the movie captivates with its visual style and thematic complexity. Ti West does a masterful job of capturing the dangerous atmosphere of L. A.'s nightlife, especially thanks to the camerawork of Eliot Rockett, who brings out the fluorescent lights of sex stores and erotic shows as well as the dark alleys of Hollywood Boulevard.",

Directed by the visionary auteur who has become synonymous with avant-garde filmmaking, \"MaXXXine\" is a testament to the power of cinema to transcend the ordinary and venture into the extraordinary. The narrative weaves a tapestry of themes that are both timeless and timely, exploring the depths of human emotion against a backdrop of surreal landscapes that are as haunting as they are beautiful. The protagonist, portrayed with a delicate balance of vulnerability and strength, embarks on a journey that is as much an odyssey of the soul as it is a physical quest. The cinematography is nothing short of spellbinding, with each frame meticulously crafted to evoke a sense of wonder and awe. The use of light and shadow, the sweeping panoramas, and the intimate close-ups all serve to create a visual symphony that lingers long after the credits roll. The score, a masterful composition that fuses classical motifs with modern sensibilities, underscores the film's emotional core and elevates the narrative to new heights. It is a soundtrack that does not just accompany the action but becomes an integral character in its own right. \"MaXXXine\" is a film that defies convention and expectation, a bold statement in a sea of mediocrity. It is a film that deserves not just to be watched, but to be experienced, to be felt in the very marrow of one's bones, it stands as a beacon of artistic integrity and creative courage. In conclusion, \"MaXXXine\" is a must-see for anyone who cherishes the art of filmmaking. It is a film that challenges, inspires, and ultimately reaffirms our belief in the transformative power of cinema. Prepare to be whisked away on a journey that is both profound and exhilarating-a journey that only the medium of film can provide, and remember a cinematic triumph that can dazzles and delighted. One more thing even know this is the final chapter of the Ti West's X & Pearl. Always remember they did phenomenonal job they put in so much work and yes this is the first time Mia Goth actually kicked the background actor. A bully but does not mess around.",

        "body":"A24 and Ti West have undoubtedly given us one of the most stimulating horror trilogies of recent times. A saga that comes to an end with the entertaining and seductive MaXXXine, which in its eighties style gives us a film that closes with a red ribbon, the evolution of Maxine Miller.Its director offers us a film that is an entertaining bloody horror film, with that perfect homage to the cinema and industry of Hollywood and all its cruel world behind it. Its director knows how to express in his script those milestones that mark the industry and the horror genre, but at the same time he also allows himself to leave a strong background of the price of fame and the status that an industry grants you that is not for everyone, but for those who resist the most.Within the hubbub that its director raises, we find a story that delivers moments that allow you to get hooked and stay connected to a story that becomes more enriching when we have already seen his two previous proposals, but it also has the grace of working as an individual film, although with much less pleasure from experience.The big star is undoubtedly our Mia Goth who once again devours the screen with her interpretation of Maxine and frankly the saga works as a great catapult for one of the rising stars like the British actress who once again gives herself completely to a character that she makes her own and envelops it like an immortal diva.It's a visually stunning and wild ride through the dark streets of Los Angeles, with a hysteria towards Satanism and serial killers surrounding a resolution of a character who is still a young girl pursuing her dreams. Interspersed with secondary characters who provide fun moments and make even more enjoyable a story that never lets you get bored.Although it fails to surpass its two predecessors, it is a film that has its own heart and is truly enjoyable and satisfying from the director's staging that transports us in space and time to the eighties and at the same time gives us all that analogy of an industry that has captivated us throughout history.I'm left with a successful ending to the show to cleverly close a saga that has won us over thanks to the daring of a director who has not been afraid to touch on key points and give a burning sensuality to an idea that has come out perfectly with a personal performance like that of its biggest star in three films that simply fulfill the entertainment that one was looking for.",

(Props off to whoever pieced that together) Combined with everyone's love for 80s Nostalgia, which is causing a lot of cash grabs by using that decade at the moment. With only a few good productions from it.It's clear here the director just wanted to try ad many different 80s styles he could, including going for some Gallio. Unfortunately none of it was pulled off very well. ( I think the only authentic 80s feeling I got was the end, with prop on bed, & camera out zooming).I can't blame Mia for this. She did what she could & was probably the strongest actor there. The rest were abysmal.The entire plot\/story was such a let down & a massive misses opportunity considering what the Trailer seemed to offer.I thought this would be the redeeming film as wasn't a fan of Pearl, but although X was mediocre I really liked Goth in X she captured something there & I'm really not usually a fan of hers. So I think for me I will only ever return to X for a rewatch. I had seen reviews slating Maxxxine but still had a lil hope.

Overall, due to its references and iconography from the '80s, Goth's understated yet nuanced performance, cinematic kills, an intriguing and vibrant Hollywood setting, and a bold story, this movie is quite good, and even though there were many expendable characters that didn't add much to the narrative, and some unnecessary and distracting split-screen shots, I enjoyed my time with it, and think that it was a great bittersweet ending to this impressive trilogy.",

If you wanted a retro film within a film or a love letter to the seedy 80s, you're still better off with films from that real decade. The novelty of attempting to show the 1980s is wearing thin here.Mia Goth returns as the fame-chasing Maxine in a film that feels built for streaming. The style over substance aesthetic was less than you may expect. The decisions of horror lacked suspense, the gore rather secluded, and not a single \"chase\" for a supposed slasher.The marketing and commercials show every scene possible, that doesn't lead to much. The retro aesthetic only a thin & fleeting surface. The story was obviously rushed, plot haphazard. The cameo appearances you might be excited for get barely any screen time, & their characters barely any writing. The deaths have an overwhelmingly cliche & trite nature.If that makes it sound like I didn't enjoy this film, I did. I just think had it been better it would have done the retro VHS horror some better due justice. When your movie is about a movie within a movie viewers have raised expectations, and instead with Maxxxine there is too much withholding. 90% filler only worked well in the 80s because you knew the budget went somewhere & focused somewhere albeit the practical effects or a grand climax scene. Here, I'm wondering where the budget focused, if not for trying to save the film's first impression.",

        "body":"Ti West's MAXXXINE is a 21st century Grindhouse flick, as were the first two installments of this trilogy - \"X\" and \"PEARL\". His style is definitely informed by Tarantino's black comedy takes on this genre, although not always as clever. The key ingredient that transforms Ti's work from average horror fare or mimicking Quentin's work is his lead actress, Mia Goth, who also produced this movie.In this way, MAXXINE is truly a tailor-made vehicle for the new Hollywood horror queen, Mia Goth, although I wouldn't characterize her as a \"scream queen\". Although she endures a great bit of physical and psychological trauma in her role as Maxxxine, Ms. Minx seems equally prepared to dish it out. It's hard not to think of how Pam Grier transformed such blaxploitation films like COFFY and FOXY BROWN into empowering revenge fantasies for women. Mia trades in her London born accent for a mildly Southern sounding American accent during these flicks.The movie is set in Hollywood, CA during the summer of 1985, when the Night Stalker (Richard Ramirez) was still at large. The cinematography and site selections portray Hollywood in all of its seediness and squalor, which seem fairly accurate based on my own visits to that district. Lots of news clips and music from that era frame this time capsule in a way that seem to be both a tribute and tongue-in-cheek chuckle at the gaudiness and depravity of that era. Although the movie does get rather bloody and violent in a few places, the black comedy perspective keeps West's brand of horror from becoming overly grim or scary. Like Tarantino's KILL BILL series, this is less about the violence than our lead character finding vindication or justice through revenge.The casting here is much more impressive than the first two X trilogy flicks, although it's hard for anyone to truly outshine Mia's starring role. Giancarlo Esposito, Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Debicki all offer memorable performances, as does Simon Prast (as Rev. Ernest Miller).Although some earlier reviews have implied that MAXXINE is somehow the lesser movie of this trilogy, I'd say it's pretty much on par with the others, although PEARL remains my favorite by an axe handle. Again, this is very much modern Grindhouse fare, which is a bit more polished than the old drive-in flicks that inspired it, but still only of a slightly higher grade. With one's expectations firmly in check, MAXXXINE is still very entertaining for what it is - and yet another memorable performance to behold from Mia Goth.",

        "body":"I loved this movie so much! I've been waiting since the premier of pearl to watch this movie, and it did not disappoint. Mia Goth is a powerhouse that doesn't stop and the whole cast of this film supported her to become the best yet. Ti West has created such an atmospheric trilogy with each film creating an entirely different vibe that makes you really dive into these movies. These are going to always be a staple to watch during Halloween or for a movie night with friends. Majority of the scenes that were in this movie were so amazing, in terms of scope, set design and execution.Highly recommend this movie and trilogy overall, great job to everyone involved.",

        "body":"I loved X and Pearl and own both on bluray. I was looking forward to seeing Maxxxine but what a shame, it was such a disappointment. I can't believe it has a higher rating on here than X even though so many reviews agree that X and Pearl were so good. I don't even see how this movie relates to the first 2 even though it's supposed to be the end of the trilogy. Maxxxine just felt like a B rated movie about a killer who ends up getting caught in the end. Nothing original. I will definitely not be buying this on physical media. It just makes me appreciate the first 2 even more. I think the whole thing should have stopped at Pearl.",
